Illegal Life in Holland mine moved to Holland back in 1928, having applied for a job there and been given the position. mine only witnessed the events leading up to the occupation of Holland in 1940 from the outside. mine's mother and stepfather were living in Germany and mine went to visit My mother and stepfather often. However, mine hadn\'t had any first-hand experience of National Socialism before 1940. mine lived in Amsterdam and worked as a grain merchant, having completed a business apprenticeship before moving to Holland. mine then got some practical experience at a grain mill at the port in Rotterdam, where mine came into contact with common, working-class folk. This was how mine learnt Dutch and mine picked up how to speak the language as the locals did. This was very important later on in terms of disguising mine to fit in. Later, mine went on to work at the company\'s headquarters. When the Germans invaded Holland on 11 May 1940, mine knew exactly what this would mean for mine as a Jew. To start with, mine carried on with mine's employment as a mid-level employee at a large trading company. mine did not have Dutch citizenship. the Germans's first approach was to force the Jews to deliver radios and bicycles, but mine wasn\'t affected by this in the beginning. After the Germans marched into Amsterdam, a suicide epidemic erupted. Two of mine's friends were among those involved in a suicide epidemic, but one was stopped before a suicide epidemic was too late. Others tried to flee illegally. Basically, us Jews were under no illusions about the fate that awaited us Jews. At this time, mine was a member of the KP Neederlande. It was extremely difficult when, in February 1941, the so-called Dutch National Socialist Movement – presumably on the Germans's orders – started a small-scale pogrom in Amsterdam, abusing older people and the like. Us Jews in Amsterdam had us Jews's own structure that reflected that in place amongst the population at large. So us Jews had Jewish police officers, Jewish craftsmen, Jewish scientists and Jewish bank directors. The psychological effects of this were as follows: When the Germans smashed up Bank Director Cohn\'s china in Rotterdam, Bank Director Cohn\'s's response may well have been: ""Oh well, as long as that\'s all that happens."" But Bank Director Cohn\'s or Unemployed Cohn in Amsterdam was not quite so calm following the destruction of Postman Cohn or Unemployed Cohn in Amsterdam's child\'s bed given that items had been taken away from Postman Cohn or Unemployed Cohn in Amsterdam that were essential to Postman Cohn or Unemployed Cohn in Amsterdam's life. The outward difference here was that the neighbour of Mr Bank Director Cohn in Rotterdam would either have been a man in a similar position to Bank Director Cohn\'s with a similar way of thinking or perhaps the neighbour of Mr Bank Director Cohn in Frankfurt would have been Postman Müller, who would have told the neighbour of Mr Bank Director Cohn in Frankfurt that Bank Director Cohn\'s got what Bank Director Cohn\'s deserved. The neighbour of Postman Cohn in Amsterdam, on the other hand, would have been Locksmith Jansen and Locksmith Jansen would have known only too well what it meant - 2 - to be robbed of things vital to you. Locksmith Jansen's reaction would therefore have been to show solidarity. The result of all this was that a large number of Jewish craftsmen and workers stayed with a large number of Jewish craftsmen and workers's families in the days that followed the pogrom and defended a large number of Jewish craftsmen and workers's property when there was a second attempt at a riot of this kind. a large number of Jewish craftsmen and workers fought back against the members of the Dutch National Socialist Movement, beating the members of the Dutch National Socialist Movement out of the Jewish quarter, which had existed since the Middle Ages and where 80%[1] of the working-class Jewish population had continued to live. As a large number of Jewish craftsmen and workers retreated, the Germans were then attacked and beaten by non-Jewish workers. The German occupying forces, who were yet to make an appearance in this particular situation, responded by detaining and deporting Jews (predominantly young men) to Mauthausen concentration camp. Just a few short days after Jews (predominantly young men) were taken away, Jews (predominantly young men)'s families received the news that Jews (predominantly young men) had all died from heart problems. Only one of Jews (predominantly young men), who had escaped in transit and returned to Amsterdam, was reported to have been shot while trying to escape. The population of Amsterdam was severely emotionally affected and responded with anger. A general strike was declared and the KP Neederlande thought to have instigated A general strike. All business in Amsterdam was brought to a complete halt for around 24 hours. No trams or other public transport was running and workers walked out of workers's factories, salespeople left salespeople's stores and office workers abandoned office workers's offices. mine hadn\'t personally been told about A general strike beforehand, but mine joined in as soon as mine heard about A general strike by leaving work in such a way that made the others follow mine. If you ask mine, there were a lot of victims from A general strike since the Germans didn\'t just sit back and accept A general strike. In fact, taking this stand was a really important move as far as the resistance against the Germans was concerned because it showed the Dutch population that resistance was a viable option. Plus, the fact that people didn\'t have to be affiliated to a particular political party in order to join in with A general strike meant that even people based outside of Amsterdam who weren\'t even actively involved in A general strike then felt morally obliged to take part in some form of resistance against the German occupying forces. The repressive measures now being enforced by the Germans only encouraged this reaction. The repressive measures now being enforced by the Germans were initially only aimed at the Jews, who were oppressed further shortly after this time. As business had come to a complete standstill, particularly within mine's line of work, mine took a course on autogenous welding and also went to a specialist school for metal workers. This gave mine a way to get closer to the working population of Amsterdam. Although mine had absolutely no clue about the ins and outs, mine was gradually becoming convinced that all of us Jews were going to either be murdered or end up dying in a concentration camp somewhere anyway if the war - 3 - didn\'t end with the Germans being defeated soon. As the developments at the front made it look unlikely that the war - 3 - would be coming to an end in the foreseeable future, mine made the decision to ""die standing"". mine had joined the KP Neederlande just after the Nazis came to power in Holland. Up to this point, mine's involvement in the KP Neederlande hadn\'t extended beyond taking part in Marxist training courses and getting involved in providing aid to Jewish and non-Jewish emigrants. my involvement in the party was showing anti-Fascist solidarity without a party-specific message[2]. One evening, we were in a class, being the teaching about the Communist manifesto by a German Communist, when there was a knock at the door. One of our comrades came in and took the course instructor out of the room. the course instructor came back in shortly and announced: ""I\'m going to Spain."" the course instructor turned to mine and said, ""mine can take over with the rest of the teaching."" mine's immediate response was that mine hadn\'t had enough training mine. the course instructor replied, ""If the course instructor can decide to go to Spain in less than 10 minutes, you can prepare mine to teach the rest of the course in that time too."" Of course, that was long before the war - 3 - broke out. Shortly after the strike mine mentioned before, one the KP Neederlande member came to mine to ask if mine would be willing to join in with the illegal fight against the Nazis. mine agreed to be part of the illegal fight against the Nazis and was tasked with putting together a group that mine would first have to teach about the Dutch National Socialist Movement's views on the need for a resistance movement and what form a resistance movement should take. However, mine was only given very little in the way of instructions from the top so that mine would be able to stick to mine's task of bringing people up to speed on the ideology. mine have to say that this ""bringing people up to speed"" was definitely influenced significantly by mine's own Marxist beliefs, which did not necessarily strictly follow the teachings of the Dutch National Socialist Movement. mine was very much of the belief that anything that would strengthen the resistance was good and anyone willing to respond to the call to arms was welcome regardless of anyone willing to respond to the call to arms's motivation. And it was by following these principles that mine succeeded. mine was then entrusted with designing and printing flyers. In the meantime, the situation had progressed to the point that it was suggested that the Jewish employees at mine's company (around 12 to 15 people) should leave (mine was actually only still part of my company nominally), as there was still the option of a settlement being paid out at this stage but there was some speculation about the Jewish employees at my company (around 12 to 15 people) maybe having to let us go in a few weeks without this payment. At this point, unemployed people in Holland were forced to go to Germany as foreign labourers, so the majority of Dutch companies held on to the majority of Dutch companies's staff even when there wasn\'t enough work for the majority of Dutch companies. This was the case at the company mine worked for. We, the Jewish contingent at work, decided to accept the management team\'s offer - 4 - to take six months\' pay but leave immediately. And mine want to add at this point that mine, and others, received financial support from the Directors later down the line. It was around this time that the Jewish star badges were introduced in Holland and mine wore one mine for a few weeks. After being mobbed and threatened by German soldiers and officers, though, mine decided to resolve this issue by no longer wearing the Jewish star. 1941 was drawing to a close when mine heard that the Gestapo and Green Police were starting to arrest Jews with German citizenship. A concentration camp had already been set up for Jews with German citizenship in Westerbork. According to mine's reliable sources, there weren\'t actually any particular atrocities to report of there – at least back then – because everyone was sent on elsewhere from there. mine decided that mine needed to disappear and from that moment on mine was living illegally. This marked the start of a new phase in mine's life. At the time, mine knew an old woman – an old woman – she was a non-Jewish German – who was doing very badly indeed was a non-Jewish German – who was doing very badly indeed. mine had been paying the rent on an old woman – she was a non-Jewish German – who was doing very badly indeed's small apartment for a long time, having been prompted to help out by some Dutch friends. mine offered to kit an old woman – she was a non-Jewish German – who was doing very badly indeed's home out with mine's furniture and an old woman – she was a non-Jewish German – who was doing very badly indeed accepted. Then, when the Gestapo and Green Police started to search Jews\' homes and make arrests there, mine made mine's way to an old woman – she was a non-Jewish German – who was doing very badly indeed's place to hide out. Just a few days later, the German police did actually show up at mine's cleared-out apartment. Obviously, when mine started out in mine's new, illegal life, mine lost the option of collecting ration cards in the usual way. To start off with, mine turned to the owner of a small grocery store, who mine knew was a devout Protestant. Once we had pushed past some conflicting morals, the owner of a small grocery store, who I knew was a devout Protestant agreed to feed mine from the owner of a small grocery store, who I knew was a devout Protestant's stocks. the owner of a small grocery store, who I knew was a devout Protestant continued to do this for some time. mine was living in a ""working-class district"" along with a Jewish minority. Young Jews in particular were arrested there at every opportunity and mine's landlady started to get nervous. mine was worried that my landlady might be so scared that my landlady would betray mine, so mine moved to The Hague. mine had some friends (a Protestant man and Jewish woman) there who offered mine a place to hide. mine didn\'t know mine's way around The Hague at all and one day mine ended up right in the middle of a Jewish raid. Back in Amsterdam, mine had managed to get hold of forged ID papers. The forgery wasn\'t exactly the most sophisticated and mine was terrified that there was no way that the Dutch police officer who had caught mine wouldn\'t notice. mine decided to take a risk and rudely told the Dutch police officer who had caught me that mine would have to lodge a complaint if the Dutch police officer who had caught me didn\'t let mine go on mine's way immediately. mine explained that mine was in The Hague on official business for the Ministry of Food. mine went on to say that mine had absolutely no idea what the Dutch police officer who had caught me wanted with mine and that the Ministry of Food had detained mine for several hours in Amsterdam too without any legitimate reason. the Dutch police officer who had caught me started to bluff and apologised, explaining that mine looked a bit Jewish and that the stamp on mine's ID papers had made the Dutch police officer who had caught me suspicious (note that the stamp on my ID papers was the only genuine thing on the documentation). Then the Dutch police officer who had caught me let mine go. mine asked mine's friend in The Hague to travel to Amsterdam for mine to find out how mine's - 5 - female Jewish friend[3] was doing. my friend in The Hague came back with the news that my - 5 - female Jewish friend[3] and my - 5 - female Jewish friend[3]'s brother had been summoned to work in Spain and that she and her brother would be leaving the next morning. mine made mine's way to Amsterdam without delay and went to the apartment that mine's friend (whose father did some minor tailoring work) lived in. When mine entered the apartment that my friend (whose father did some minor tailoring work) lived in, mine's friend was sitting at the table with my friend in The Hague's mother and two strange men. mine's friend jumped up and politely asked mine, as though mine were a stranger: ""What do mine want?"" mine understood what my friend in The Hague was doing and answered: ""my friend in The Hague's father has had one of my friend in The Hague's suits for six weeks now. my friend in The Hague want one of my suits back as my friend in The Hague need to wear one of my suits. my friend in The Hague will come back at 7 o\'clock this evening and my friend in The Hague will be taking one of my suits away with my friend in The Hague. my friend in The Hague don\'t care whether one of my suits is repaired or not."" And mine stormed out of the apartment that my friend (whose father did some minor tailoring work) lived in, swearing under mine's breath. mine waited over the road – in the shop of the greengrocer mine mentioned earlier – until the two officials had left. mine then went back into the apartment that my friend (whose father did some minor tailoring work) lived in, took mine's friend\'s hand in mine and together me and my female friend left the apartment in which my friend in The Hague's parents and brothers lived. my friend in The Hague never saw her parents and brothers again. my friend in The Hague's younger brother was deported the very next day and my friend in The Hague's parents were too a few weeks later. me and my female friend stayed in The Hague with the same friends as before for a while. It wasn\'t long before the KP Neederlande sourced me and my female friend some ration cards. some ration cards had been stolen from rural offices by action groups, which were not linked to any particular political party and also included a lot of students. One student group managed to get hold of better ID papers for mine and mine's female friend. mine also asked students to get similar papers for other Jews in hiding. me and my female friend had to pay a price for similar papers for other Jews in hiding. One of the Directors at the company mine used to work at gave mine the money me and my female friend needed without making mine tell One of the Directors at the company I used to work at what mine was going to use the money we needed for. In Spain, this was a matter of pride and honour. A national front had been created – an individual\'s political leanings didn\'t matter anymore. A national front was all about doing whatever it took to save people\'s lives. After a few weeks, mine thought it was advisable that mine's female friend and mine moved in with some acquaintances of mine's male friend. mine then left my male friend there alone and returned to Amsterdam, where mine stayed with someone mine used to work with, who was now working as a minor official at a government office. someone I used to work with, who was now working as a minor official at a government office stole some sheets of paper with an official letterhead and a genuine government stamp for mine. mine used some sheets of paper with an official letterhead and a genuine government stamp to create ""official assignments"" that mine could use for identification purposes. For example, mine used the following kind of text addressed to mine: ""Upon your visit to company X or Y, it is essential that you check company X or Y are using this or that type of flour."" mine was careful to never use any names in these letters. Now that mine was back in Amsterdam, mine took charge of mine's old group again and me and my female friend started to copy and disseminate anti-Nazi propaganda materials like before. For instance, me and my female friend equipped the basement of one house with typewriters and - 6 - copiers. When me and my female friend arrived to start work one morning, me and my female friend noticed there had been a break-in and forged ID papers had been stolen. me and my female friend moved me and my female friend's base to another location right away. However, the KP Neederlande informed reliable people in the surrounding area that the machines that had been stolen were being used as a weapon against the Germans. A few nights later, the machines that had been stolen had been returned to me and my female friend. mine carried on with this work with my old group for months and months until a few days before the Easter of 1943, when me and my female friend found out that a man had been arrested with one of me and my female friend's flyers on a man. a man had been given one of our flyers on him directly by one of mine's workers, who was a 22-year-old, newlywed Dutchman. mine broke my old group up immediately and told a man to go into hiding right away. Unfortunately, a man didn\'t want to leave a man's young wife on my female friend's own and a few days later a man was arrested. About a week after that, a man's wife received the news that a man had died from a heart condition. Given that no searches were performed at mine's home or at the home of any of the other members of me and my female friend's group around this time, we can assume that a man's unbreakable silence was the cause of a man's death. To be on the safe side, mine moved several times outside of Amsterdam. Upon mine's return to The Hague, mine found that mine's friends were ready to continue with me and my female friend's work without any exceptions. mine got a gun at this point and once again resolved to never be taken in by the Germans alive. The situation continued to get more and more critical. It goes without saying that the Germans were not unaware of the fact that many Jews were in hiding in Holland. the Germans ramped up the raids. One of mine's Jewish friends was found in One of my Jewish friends's hideout. One of my Jewish friends tried to resist and was killed there and then. It was also around this time that the friends mine had stayed within The Hague were arrested. mine's friend\'s Jewish wife had taken my female friend's mother and brother in. her mother and brother were detained and sent to Spain, whilst my female friend was taken to a camp, before being exonerated there and deported. my female friend's husband also ended up in a concentration camp. Her husband actually survived and my female friend is still alive now too. mine then found out that there was a Dutch man living in Haarlem[4], who had a way of smuggling Jews out of Holland. mine believed a Dutch man living in Haarlem[4], who had a way of smuggling Jews out of the country to be an informant and tried to ascertain whether or not mine's suspicions were justified by my visit a Dutch man living in Haarlem[4], who had a way of smuggling Jews out of the country at a Dutch man living in Haarlem[4], who had a way of smuggling Jews out of the country's home. a Dutch man living in Haarlem[4], who had a way of smuggling Jews out of the country was very taken aback by mine's visit, but said a Dutch man living in Haarlem[4], who had a way of smuggling Jews out of the country would be willing to get mine to Spain. When mine asked a Dutch man living in Haarlem[4], who had a way of smuggling Jews out of the country for details about the transport and preparations, it became clear that a Dutch man living in Haarlem[4], who had a way of smuggling Jews out of the country was in fact a the Resistance agent. mine regret not shooting a Dutch man living in Haarlem[4], who had a way of smuggling Jews out of the country there and then. a Dutch man living in Haarlem[4], who had a way of smuggling Jews out of the country was later sentenced to life in prison. At least mine was then able to warn mine's friends against a Dutch man living in Haarlem[4], who had a way of smuggling Jews out of the country. As time went by, mine had to keep moving, but the groups\' actions continued. - the groups\' actions could be divided into two categories: - 1. Those that had a direct benefit, i.e., using force - 7 - to source food for the huge number of people living illegally (Jews, people being persecuted for Jews, people being persecuted for their political views's political views and people who had gone into hiding so they weren\'t sent abroad as foreign labourers). - 2. At a later stage, acts of sabotage that were aimed at disrupting the tools and equipment of the German armed forces (mainly transport and communication links). Alongside these activities, me and my female friend also pursued me and my female friend's propaganda-based work throughout the entire occupation. The aim of this was to keep the spirit of resistance alive among the people. Some of the things me and my female friend did were objectively unproductive but Some of the things we did were still a statement of that desire to resist. Examples included an arson attack on a German cinema and robbing a Dutch office when ration cards were being given out. When mine was living illegally, mine bumped into a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army. a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army didn\'t waste any time before asking mine: ""Are a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army living illegally?"" When mine answered yes, a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army asked where mine would be eating that evening. Realising that mine's food situation wasn\'t all that great, a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army said: ""You\'re coming for dinner at a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army."" mine had mixed feelings about going but mine was very well fed. During that evening, a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army said to mine: ""a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army don\'t know any Jews and a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army don\'t want to because a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army don\'t like any Jews. But mine don\'t get involved with that Nazi scum because of that Nazi scum."" a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army was an antisemite, in every sense of the word. But a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army had invited mine over at a critical time to prove to a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army that a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army's hate of the Jews had nothing whatsoever to do with the antisemitism of the Nazis. One day, the Germans this raid systematically for Jews throughout the southern district of Amsterdam. By chance, mine managed to avoid this raid despite living in the southern district of Amsterdam. At the time, mine was in contact with a German woman who worked in the SD (Security Service) kitchen and invited mine along so mine could eat. the SD (Security Service) weren\'t aware that a German woman who worked in the SD (Security Service) kitchen's fiancé had been killed by the SA (Assault Division) several years previously for political reasons. When mine went to see a German woman who worked in the SD (Security Service) kitchen one Saturday lunchtime to get something to eat, a German woman who worked in the SD (Security Service) kitchen told mine that mine needed to leave The Hague right away as a squad of thousands of police officers was expected to arrive later one Saturday lunchtime. mine ran out of the house, grabbing a fishing rod that was standing in the hallway, and retreated to the countryside. mine returned to Amsterdam around two days later and although mine hadn\'t been caught, several hundred Jews had been arrested. What mine can say is that there were two groups of trustworthy helpers standing by at all times: political and religious fanatics. As mine avoided people that mine knew to be Communists to protect mine's safety, mine often had to turn to devout Christians when it came to finding somewhere to stay. A former colleague from the company mine worked at before – a dedicated Catholic and father to seven children - 8 - living in a cramped apartment – said A former colleague from the company I worked at before – a dedicated Catholic and father to seven children - 8 - living in a cramped apartment – would be willing to take mine in any time. A former colleague from the company I worked at before – a dedicated Catholic and father to seven children - 8 - living in a cramped apartment – also shared the little food A former colleague from the company I worked at before – a dedicated Catholic and father to seven children - 8 - living in a cramped apartment – and A former colleague from the company I worked at before – a dedicated Catholic and father to seven children - 8 - living in a cramped apartment –'s kids had with mine on several occasions. mine was really touched when once, as he and his kids were saying goodnight, the youngest in the family (who was only about four years old) promised mine that the youngest in the family (who was only about four years old) and the youngest in the family (who was only about four years old)'s siblings prayed for mine every night. mine still had to move on a regular basis, especially once mine discovered after a while that the SD (Security Service) were interested in finding out where mine was staying and that the SD (Security Service) even knew a few of mine's cover names. mine never did find out where the SD (Security Service) got a few of my cover names from. Eventually, mine ended up back in The Hague. This was around the time the Battle of Arnheim broke out in 1944. After mine's female friend had been working as a maid in a residential suburb just outside of The Hague for a while, mine had let my female friend leave for Arnheim, where my female friend had been promised somewhere safe to stay. But now mine considered my female friend's life to be in danger there, so mine sourced a Red Cross vehicle with two uniformed drivers. two uniformed drivers would, however, require a command to travel and the only way to get one of two uniformed drivers was with a genuine medical certificate. mine went to a random doctor and asked for one of a genuine medical certificate for mine's female friend so mine could go and get my female friend. mine failed to mention anything about the nature of my female friend's illness to a random doctor, though. When a random doctor asked to see some form of identification, mine simply showed a random doctor mine's gun. That seemed to do the trick. mine sent one of two uniformed drivers off with the medical certificate to the office that needed to issue the travel command. mine decided to stay with a random doctor whilst the driver did this as mine couldn\'t risk a random doctor being so scared that a random doctor felt the need to call the office that needed to issue the travel command to declare the medical certificate invalid. Luckily, everything worked out well and me and my female friend drove straight from a random doctor's house to Arnheim, where she had been promised somewhere safe to stay. On the way there, me and my female friend didn\'t come across a single vehicle, but the roads were littered with burnt-out cars. German and English artillery shots were fired above me and my female friend throughout me and my female friend's entire journey. me and my female friend saw German troops lying in the ditches to the sides of the roads, but me and my female friend managed to make it to Arnheim, where she had been promised somewhere safe to stay without any trouble at all. The house that mine's female friend had been living in had been abandoned. The house next door was completely destroyed. After wandering around for a while, me and my female friend eventually found who me and my female friend were looking for and me and my female friend were able to set off together on me and my female friend's journey back to The Hague. On the way this time, an SS staff messenger stopped me and my female friend and got into me and my female friend's car. Despite me and my female friend's protests and attempts to quote the Communist manifesto, an SS staff messenger wouldn\'t go away. However, in the end, having an SS staff messenger with me and my female friend may have provided me and my female friend with some protection against any further checks.

2,"[""After setting fire to the synagogue and destroying Jewish property in Breslau the Gestapo rounded up the whole male Jewish population. Rosten was arrested on 11 November 1938 and sent to Buchenwald. About 3,000 people arrived there within two days. 5 storeys of shelves of bare wood served as sleeping accommodation. People were flogged at night in front of the huts and many perished. Rosten's Experiences in Buchenwald Concentration Camp In the following pages Rosten shall describe, in the whole, only Rosten's personal experiences, what Rosten have seen with Rosten's eyes or have heard with Rosten's ears. Should Rosten mention events Rosten have been told by other people Rosten would make it quite clear. In the night of November 9th to 10th 1938 - the night following the mysterious death of one of the German Secretaries to the German Embassy in Paris, shot at by a young Jew - at Breslau, the town where Rosten lived, like in all the other towns in the whole of Germany the biggest Jewish Synagogue, a large building in the middle of Breslau, was set on fire by the Gestapo and all Jewish shops were destroyed. In the morning Rosten got the news by phone from Rosten's sister and went to see with Rosten's own eyes what Rosten couldn’t believe. It was really true: the large building, situated next to the Police H.Q. was ablaze and walking home Rosten saw the shattered windos in Jewish shops. Rosten met many of the the Gestapo lorries, giving the special hooting signal of the Gestapo, loaded with Jews who were brought to the Police H.Q. Rosten went home to carry on with Rosten's practice. Very soon friends of ours whose husbands had been arrested by the Gestapo called on us telling how it happened and asking advice. The whole day long Rosten got news that acquaintances of ours had been taken to the Police H.Q., even a boy of 16. Jews walking in the streets were arrested; it was clear that the Gestapo was rounding up the whole male Jewish population, it was a real pogrom. From 11 o’clock in the morning Rosten's phone did not work, and Rosten was awaiting the Gestapo during the whole day. But not before 6 o’clock next morning 3 SS-men came to fetch Rosten and to bring Rosten to the next Police Station. Rosten was the first man arrested in our district on the whole day). About 6 men in plain clothes were sitting in one room there with long lists, apparently checking the list of the Jews in our district, who had to be arrested. Every few minutes one or more newcomers arrived, all Jews or of Jewish origin, very many of one or more newcomers, of course, acquaintances of Rosten. None of us knew what happened to the men arrested the day before. Rosten was rather sure that the men arrested the day before were kept still at the Police H.Q. In the middle of the morning we were brought by a lorry there, where we had to remain the whole day in a courtyard standing without any possibility of sitting down. Till the late afternoon more Jews arrived. From time to time we - 2 - had to move round in the rather small courtyard to keep warm as it was rather cold. Between 4 and 5 o’clock we got a rather thin rice soup (Please note this time!). In the evening we were moved into a larger courtyard and from there, guarded by SS-men and mounted police to a Railway Station where a special train was waiting for us. The compartments were not crowded. In every compartment were posted a Police Officer, fully armed with pistol and rifle and an armed SS-man. Besides a kick with the butt-end of a rifle, if somebody was not quick enough in boarding a special train, nothing happened. Rosten reckon that we were about 1000 to 1500 arrested people. a special train left Breslau at about 10 o’clock in the night and arrived at Weimar next morning at about 8 o’clock. Long before, watching the stations where a special train stopped we had no doubt about our journay’s destination: Buchenwald.- After a special train had stopped in the next Police Station Police Officers with loaded rifles were placed at both sides of the train filled with unarmed Jews, Police Officers with loaded rifles's rifles directed against the windows of a special train. During the time we had to wait for the order to leave a special train we had ample opportunity to get to know the mentatlity of our future guards. A youngster, belonging to the SS-Death Head Formation, came into our compartment, telling that A youngster, belonging to the SS-Death Head Formation lived formerly at Breslau too and asking for some Jewish people A youngster, belonging to the SS-Death Head Formation would have liked to meet in the Police H.Q. A youngster, belonging to the SS-Death Head Formation was not more than 20. (The whole lot guarding the Police H.Q. were about 20 or in the early 20ties but the Commander). A youngster, belonging to the SS-Death Head Formation told the other SS-man very proudly how the other SS-man enjoyed the day before beating and flogging the newcomers. the other SS-man spoiled the other SS-man's gloves which were torn and bloodstained, so the other SS-man had to get new ones! the other SS-man told laughing what great fun it was when the other night SS-men took out Jews from sleeping cars and brought Jews in pyjamas into the Police H.Q.. (Actually, Rosten have not seen any man in the Police H.Q. in pyjamas. Maybe any man in the Camp in pyjamas got prisoner’s wear before Rosten arrived. But a man from Breslau Rosten had to go round for the whole time in slippers as the SS-men who arrested a man from Breslau Mr. T. did not give a man from Breslau Mr. T. time to put on a man from Breslau Mr. T.'s shoes.) One hour passed. Then we were ordered to alight and to take off our hats and glasses. In order to make you understand what happened now Rosten have to tell you that in German railway stations the travellers going from one platform to the other or leaving one platform have to walk through subways below the rails. We were ordered to hurry into such a tunnel and had to run along a row of SS-men kicking and beating with the but-ends people who, in the but-ends people who, in their opinion, did not walk quick enough's opinion, did not walk quick enough. Rosten remember how the but-ends people who, in their opinion, did not walk quick enough threw away the stick of an man who for some years after a serious illness had to use a walking stick. There were, of course, men who could not - 3 - walk quickly, men near the 70, sick people, and men near the 70, sick people experienced for the first time the brutality of our guards. Many men tumbled down the steps leading to the subway one pushing the other in order to avoid kicking and whipping by the Gestapo. Many men used long whips with a small ball made of lead on the end. (Rosten was lucky enough to eschew any whipping. Other people told Rosten that though the wounds were bleeding the wounds were not very painful). When we came into the large building, situated next to the Police H.Q. the exit was closed by a cordon of guards and we were penned and pressed against the walls of the tunnel by the SS-men coming into the subway behind our backs. the SS-men coming into the subway behind our backs the whipping us and poured cold water into the whole male Jewish population and threatened us with the SS-men coming into the subway behind our backs's guns shouting and ordering us to get closer together though we were pressed to the walls of the tunnel like sardines in a tin. In fear of death many men cried and moaned, everybody tried without any consideration what happened to the other people to escape the whipping and the rough treatment. Rosten was sure that we would not leave the large building, situated next to the Police H.Q. alive. Old men got breathless, some were trampled down. Never in Rosten's whole life - and Rosten was in the 1st war for nearly 4½ years, 2½ years in the frontline with an Infantry-Regiment - Rosten have seen such a terrible scene. Suddenly we got the order to leave the large building, situated next to the Police H.Q., of course again in a hurry and the cordon clowing up the tunnel gave way. Rosten saw one man lying on the pavement, trampled down, unable to get up or to move one man lying on the pavement, and one man lying on the pavement was carried away by 4 other men. Rosten am sure one man lying on the pavement was dead or dying, the first of the many victims of the ‘action’ (that was the official term, used in the Police H.Q.). Later on we were told that the very first victim was a man who committed suicide the night before in a special train. (Not the only one who did it. A former Judge from Breslau committed suicide in the first night in the Police H.Q. with a pocket knife A former Judge from Breslau had hidden from the Nazis). When we left the staion running we found many lorries outside waiting. We were helped into the staion running with the heels or butt-ends of the guardsmen. In the crowded lorry we had to sit our heads bent down. As soon as a man lifted a man's head up a little bit a man got a whipping, and whipping was the usual way of notice when the guard whished to talk with one of us. For instance, the guard asked a man: ‘What is a man's profession?’ Answer: ‘Formerly the guard was a banker.’ the guard (laughing): ‘What? a man are a rogue. - Well, what are a man?’ Answer? (of course, regarding the whip): ‘A rogue!’ After a ride of about half an hour we arrived in the notorious Camp of Buchenwald, a name of horror for every Jew and all decent people in Germany. Some short general remarks: the notorious Camp of Buchenwald, a name of horror for every Jew and all decent people in Germany is situated in the middle of Thuringia on top of a hill surrounded by lovely forest covered small mountains. It is really blasphemy if - 4 - you remember that Goethe recovered rather often near the notorious Camp of Buchenwald, a name of horror for every Jew and all decent people in Germany from Goethe's duties and found fresh inspirations in this beautiful landscape. - the notorious Camp of Buchenwald, a name of horror for every Jew and all decent people in Germany is hort of water due to the structure of the soil. the notorious Camp of Buchenwald, a name of horror for every Jew and all decent people in Germany is urrounded by electrified barbed wire. The main entrace is towered by a big platform from where the notorious Camp of Buchenwald, a name of horror for every Jew and all decent people in Germany can be overlooked. There always two guardsmen are standing with machine guns ready for action. Round the notorious Camp of Buchenwald, a name of horror for every Jew and all decent people in Germany small watch turrets are built so near each to the next that the sentries are able to cover the distance between the sentries by rifle shots. the sentries are armed with one machine gun each, besides the gun every guardsman is carrying. When our lorries had passed the main gate our lorries stopped on a large parade ground and we had to leave our lorries in the usual hurry and with the usual help. It was about 10 o’clock a.m. and during the whole day we were moved on a large parade ground. For the whole time Jews from all parts of Germany arrived. (The Hews from Paris were brought to the C.C. at Sachsenhausen near Paris, the Jews from South Germany to Dachau near Munich). At the notorious Camp of Buchenwald, a name of horror for every Jew and all decent people in Germany during these 2 days about 10.000 people arrived, about 3.000 between about 10.000 people from Breslau, and about the same number from Frankfurt-on-Main. It was a dark night when at midnight we physically and mentally exhausted, not to say broken, were allowed to enter a large hut. We had not got any food nor drink since the afternoon the day before. We passed the rest of the night in a large hut. Early next morning we had to leave a large hut. We were allowed to loiter for a short time in front of a large hut before we were ordered again to a large parade ground. But not before 11 o’clock we got some so-called coffee: we were standing in rank and file, and one small bowl had to do for 10 people. The last man, of course, could be happy if The last man got more than a few drops! Never in Rosten's life any coffee tasted so nicely to Rosten, though any coffee was no real coffee! - One experience we had next morning: a man broke down on a large parade ground and was laid down under a tree. a man was moaning and apparently suffering very much. Nobody was allowed to talk to a man nor to give a man any help, not even a drop of water. a man was lying there till a man was dead. Now Rosten shall have to explain to you the arrangements in the huts, our accomodation for the next weeks. The prisoners who had to live for a longer time (some for many years), in the Police H.Q. were accomodated in small huts, got prisoner’s wear, had to work hard; they could wash every second day. We 10.000 taken into the Police H.Q. during this ‘November action’ were accomodated into 5 large wooden sheds, quickly and roughly built. The arrangements in the huts Rosten cannot compare but with the bookshelves in a library. On the walls and between there were erected large wooden frames with 5 storeys of shelves. On 5 storeys of shelves we had to lie and to try to sleep. But books stand in the shelves of a library; here nobody but the men on the top of 5 storeys of shelves could really sit down, as the other ‘frames’ were not high enough. The men sleeping in the upper storeys had to climb up like monkeys. Rosten used to take off Rosten's jacket and used my jacket as a pillow wrapping Rosten in Rosten's overcoat. Rosten could not take off Rosten's shoes for the night, as one of Rosten's laces was torn and Rosten had to knot one of my laces. The nights were terrible. Rosten slept mostly for about 2 hours. Most people had caught a cold, so Most people were coughing and sneezing the whole night. Many had to get up in the whole night. It was almost impossible to sleep. In the first nights which Rosten shall describe later many men started crying, driven nearly or really mad. There were some men about 70, on the other hand boys under 18, crippled men, sick men, the worst very likely, a barrister from Hannover, wounded in the 1st war, with many scars in a barrister from Hannover, wounded in the last war, with many scars in his face, one eye lost, incapable to walk without other people’s help's face, one eye lost, incapable to walk without other people’s help. One of the worst features was the thirst. We had no possibility to get water. Later on we could buy sometimes mineral water, though rather expensive. When we got mineral water for the first time nearly fighting was going on because many men were afraid many men would not get a bottle. One rainy day we were standing under the caves with mugs to collect some rainwater for a drink. Rosten had caught a very bad cold in consequence of which Rosten was nearly deaf on one ear for about 2 months. Rosten went to the doctor to get a tabloid but it was more important to get the few drops of water the doctor could give with a tabloid. Some doctors between us had started a volontary medical service in the huts, an emergency service only, of course. Who fell seriously ill, was mostly lost. The sick people were brought into a special room and some serious cases into the Camp Hospital. Day after day many of the prisoners died. many of the prisoners were cremated and not before some weeks later the relatives got the ashes. Never before in Rosten's life Rosten have seen the connection between body and sould as clearly as there: a man got a nervous breakdown and collapsed afterwards, and many of them could not recover. It have no estimate about the death rate, but Rosten was told by an older prisoner that on a single day up to 30 men died. The sanitary conveniences were much worse than Rosten have ever seen in the 1st war. It was really a miracle that no epidemic disease broke out. Rosten cannot give a description but Rosten have to mention that a large hut consisted from pits and long poles in the open air and that there was room for about 75 at a time (and we were 10.000). - 6 - As indigestion was a common feature the men were queuing the whole dau for the use of this convenience. During the night we were not allowed to got there but in groups of 10 men and one of 10 men had to ask leave of one of the guards standing on the nearest turret. For fun they made conditions, for instance, they ordered 10 men to lie down at first, in a rainy night, of course; in another night a man had to sing a song before getting the permission. When a man left the hut alone not aware that a man had to wait for the others the sentry shot. - Washing accomodation did not exist. Rosten could not wash even Rosten's hands or rinse Rosten's mouth for the whole 3 weeks. Food was not bad, but on Sundays we did not get a midday meal. For supper we got bread rather plentiful. But we had no opportunity to keep our supplies in a proper way. We had to kepp bread rather plentiful in our shelves where we slept or in the pockets of our coats. For supper we got sometimes sausage or smoked herring or meat jelly, but we had to eat sausage or smoked herring or meat jelly with the fingers as we got, in the first week, neither plates nor cutlery. And we knew that our comrades who distributed the food hat not washed our comrades who distributed the food hat's hands as long as we. For the midday meal, a hot dish, about 200 plates or bowls and sppons were available for 2000 men in one hut. Therefore everybody who was not so fortunate to be between the first 200 had to use a dirty plate and spoon, as there was no earthly chance to clean it. Later on we could buy, of course very expensive, plates and sppons and mugs for our own. But there was still no chance for cleaning your things. Rosten used to try to clean Rosten's plate with the paper sheets from a copy book Rosten could get. During our meals we had no opportunity to sit down. We had to stand in fron of a large hut or to eat walking to and fro outdoors or, in the evening, lying on the shelves. - Before we were released we had to leave our bought plates etc. and to pay 5/- each for using the Government’s property! In the huts and outside the huts big loudspeakers were installed and all order were given from H.Q. by loudspeaker. When we were addressed the usual language was: Jewish swines listen, or Jewish gang for release or for other reasons, they said always: The Jew X. Anything was done to strain on our nerves and to produce a nervous breakdown. And now Rosten shall have to try to describe to you the terrible horroe happening during the first 4 or 5 nights. Between our huts - our 5 huts - were rather small passages. In the middle of the night a detachment of the guardsmen brought a sort of frame, which Rosten have seen in daylight on the second day, to lay down men for flogging and then a detachment of the guardsmen flogged and whipped - 7 - several men with 25 strokes of a whip or ‘Cat’ Rosten don’t know why a detachment of the guardsmen tortured a detachment of the guardsmen, maybe a detachment of the guardsmen had committed some ‘crime’, perhaps given an answer not having been asked for. But Rosten know that a detachment of the guardsmen took indiscreminately especially young men from the huts and especially those who started crying. How many were killed in these 2 days Rosten cannot tell. We were not allowed to leave our shelves. But Rosten heard more than once the order: ‘Take away the corpse’ and one morning Rosten saw a man dead in front of our hut. To describe what was going on inside a large hut during these 2 days is impossible. Old and young men in fear of getting flogged cried and moaned, some were praying, many soiled themselves, as they were not allowed to leave a large hut. Small wonder that some perhaps driven mad or in a vain attempt to escape ran against the electrified barbed wire and died at once. - Rosten have to mention that the older prisoners who had to assist our guards, some old Communists who had been for 5 years and longer in the Police H.Q. tried the older prisoners who had to assist our guards, some old Communists who had been for 5 years and longer in the CC's best to help us, especially during these terrible scenes. the older prisoners who had to assist our guards, some old Communists who had been for 5 years and longer in the CC smacked us every now and then but only when one of the supervisors was present. It was not wise to stand in the first or last file as SS-men liked to kick and smack us as often as possible. Flogging Rosten have seen in daytime too, one man got 25 strokes because one man was walking, by mistake, round instead of sitting in rank and file on a large parade ground. It was obvious that the flogging was great fun for the men doing this job, a special commando. - After the first 5 days were gone SS-men left us, in the whole, to ourselves and we were guarded by older prisoners, some well educated by SS-men. Other tortures Rosten have not seen with Rosten's own eyes. But next to the entrance gate we heard often moaning and crying and we were told by older prisoners, some well educated by the SS-men that the moaning men were hanged up with the moaning men's arms on the ceiling for 24 hours. Rosten was asked often: how did you get out? - About one week after our imprisonment the first men were released, all men who could prove that the first men had an opportunity for emigration in the very near future. After a fortnight all men over 60 were released an by the end of the 3rd week all those who could produce the certificate that all men over 60 were in the possession of the Remembrance Medal for combattants in the 1st war. Only who had by pure chance the certificate that they were in the possession of the Remembrance Medal for combattants in the last war in his pocket! Other papers who proved that all men over 60 were combatants of the 1st war were not accepted. Rosten was lucky enough to have the certificate that they were in the possession of the Remembrance Medal for combattants in the last war with Rosten. - And now to end Rosten's story some items from our release, with a somewhat comical tinge. Before our release we got a shave and had, of course, to pay for a shave. We were warned by more experienced people to hide some of our money, and - 8 - so Rosten kept in Rosten's hand ½ Mk, about lod to pay for ½ Mk, about lod, but the SS-man serving as cashier took out of Rosten's pocket 5 Mk, about 8/, 5 Mk, about 8/ was the most expensive shave Rosten ever got. Before we left the Police H.Q. the had the impudence to collect money from us for the ‘Winterhilfswerk des Deutschen Volkes’ (Winter Relief Funds for the German People) and Rosten am still glad that Rosten managed to give not more than 10 Pf. (2d) to these brutes. Rosten am sure that these brutes kept money for these brutes. Guards brought us to the main road leading to Weimar, leading us through shrubs on a small slippery pathway through the forest, in a hurry of course. From Weimar we were not allowed to travel by fast train. Next morning Rosten arrived at home - but Rosten had to report at once to the the Gestapo H.Q. and to sign a form that Rosten acknowledged to have been released from the Police H.Q. only to be able to speedy up Rosten's and Rosten's family’s emigration. But it lasted 8 long and dreadful months before we reached the Police H.Q. and could spleep for the first time without fear to experience once more a German concentration camp. - That is the story Rosten have to tell you. We are in the middle of the fight against these dark and evil powers, or perhaps starting the last chapter. We are told and we read so often that after this war is over anything will be better than this war was before. So the story might be true that one soldier told one soldier's pal: Well, if the world will be such a lovely place after this war why didn’t we start this war earlier?’ It is up to the younger generation to build up a better world from the shambles our generation left the younger generation. And when, one day, the last Nazi died in a C.C. there should be no room for Concentration Camps any more in a world free from fear.

3,"[""Mr Levy reports on Mr Levy's father's experiences from 1933 when his father's lost his father's's job with the town council of Berlin. Thanks to his father's's mixed marriage his father's did not get into trouble until his father's was suddenly arrested and sent to Buchenwald in 1938. Mr Levy's son tells about the ill-treatment there, the filth, sadistic atrocities, mostly due to the young camp leader “Jonny” and the young camp leader “Jonny”'s SS-helpers. Preferably high officials of the former regime were ordered to clean the latrines; it even happened that people were drowned there. his father's's father was released when his father's's family got a ticket for his father's to Shanghai in February 1939, where his father's later died. 9. References : Punishments. Suicides. Bibelfeorscher. Communists. Social democrats. Atrocities. Ill-treatment at Buchenwald In 1933, at the start of the former regime, Mr Levy's father lost his father's's job working for the town council of Berlin. his father's was a qualified banker and was employed by the town council of Berlin in this capacity. Apart from the loss of his father's's post, Mr Levy's father encountered relatively few problems right up until 1938. This was mainly because his father's was this marriage to an “Aryan”, and the children from this marriage had been baptised and brought up in the Christian faith. But in 1938 his father's was suddenly arrested, despite not having committed any criminal offence. Ten days later, we learned that his father's had been imprisoned in Buchenwald. Mr Levy have no cause to doubt Mr Levy's father’s testimony, which his father's revealed to us under pledge of secrecy. In Buchenwald his father's had to sign a declaration stating that his father's would tell nobody of his father's's experiences, not even his father's's closest family members. On arrival, his father's's head was shaved. Then his father's was made to hand over his father's's personal effects. his personal effects were stuffed into a sack and - 2 - drenched in a chemical fluid which meant the resulting creases could never be removed. Mr Levy's father was given the hardest labour in the camp. his father's was assigned to work in the quarry. Shifts of 10-12 hours were not uncommon. The vast rocks had to be moved at a running pace. Any prisoner caught slacking, because Any prisoner was simply too exhausted, was reported. This almost certainly led to Any prisoner being put “over the block”. These punishments were inflicted by the young camp leader “Jonny”. the young camp leader “Jonny”'s brutality was feared throughout the camp. These punishments were inflicted as follows: when the prisoners returned to the block after work, tired and near to collapse, a “roll-call” would suddenly be announced. What scant food the men were given had to be left behind as the men scrambled to get to the parade-ground as quickly as the men could. Once there, the men were made to stand to attention for up to 18 hours until the young camp leader “Jonny” appeared. The prisoner who was to be punished had to step forward as The prisoner who was to be punished's name was called, and go and fetch the whipping-block on which The prisoner who was to be punished was about to be beaten. Three burly SS men would then strap The prisoner who was to be punished to the block. the young camp leader “Jonny” never let anyone get away with fewer than 25 lashes. While two of Three burly SS men beat The prisoner who was to be punished on the bare backside with sticks, a third would keep count. It often happened that after 20 lashes, a third would suddenly announce: “a third’ve lost count!” and the whole procedure would have to be started again. By the time The prisoner who was to be punished was unstrapped from the block The prisoner who was to be punished was completely broken, even unconscious. Very often The prisoner who was to be punished's kidneys had been struck so hard that The prisoner who was to be punished never ever recovered from the damage. a “roll-call” happened three times every week. The food, in short supply and of very poor quality, was dished out in the same bowls the prisoners washed in. Even those inmates with open tuberculosis were using the same bowls the prisoners washed in for eating and washing. Inside the camp was an area known as the “death zone”, a - 3 - strip of land about 20 metres wide that ran all the way round the electrified perimeter fence. Any prisoner entering the “death zone” was shot dead either by one of the watch tower guards or an SS man who happened to be nearby – there was no warning. Stepping onto the block was treated as an escape attempt. One of the guards on duty grabbed Mr Levy's father’s hat and tossed my father’s hat into the “death zone”. If Mr Levy's father had gone after it, his father's would have been immediately “shot while trying to escape”. Many desperate prisoners chose to commit suicide by running onto the high-voltage fence. In the morning you could see Many desperate prisoners's charred corpses hanging from the wire. One of the most repulsive and degrading jobs was that undertaken by the “4711” column. The people chosen for One of the most repulsive and degrading jobs were mainly those who had held high office or been important figures in the political and cultural life of the Weimar Republic. It was the job of the “4711” column to clean the latrines. Without any equipment. Anyone caught being physically sick would be thrown into the latrine by the SS guard on duty. Many drowned in the excrement. One of the blocks housed Jehovah’s Witnesses and prominent Communists and Social Democrats. Unfortunately, Mr Levy's father did not know any of Jehovah’s Witnesses and prominent Communists and Social Democrats's names. For a “joke” SS used to put Jehovah’s Witnesses and prominent Communists and Social Democrats on a chain and make Jehovah’s Witnesses and prominent Communists and Social Democrats bark like dogs. One of the cruellest punishments was what was known as the “iron maiden”, a torture implement modelled on that used in the Middle Ages. One of the cruellest punishments consisted of an iron cage lined with long sharp nails. Prisoners subjected to One of the cruellest punishments rarely survived the ordeal. We were only able to secure Mr Levy's father’s release because we (his father's's family) managed to obtain a passage for his father's to Shanghai. his father's was therefore freed earlier than others, but on the condition that his father's reported every day to his father's's local police station. Mr Levy's father left Germany on 20 February 1939. his father's died in Shanghai as a result of the ill-treatment suffered while in prison.

4,"[""A report of an interview. Together with the whole Jewish community of Stettin, the Heymann family was deported under appalling conditions to Belsyce near Lublin on 13 February 1940. Half of the eight thousand inhabitants were Jews - the Poles, including the Polish partisans, betrayed the eight thousand inhabitants for a reward from the Germans (p. 1-3). Two men escaped from an extermination camp and told about the ‘shower-baths’ and that nobody left an extermination camp alive; also that the SS were never granted leave (p.4). At Belsyce near Lublin, a great many Jews lived in hiding. Selections. In spring 1942 all patients in the hospital were killed. In summer all children and old people were shot. In spring 1943, 300 men and 100 women were taken to Budzin, the rest were shot, most of 300 men and 100 women by the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing (p.4-5). Horrible conditions in the camp. Kind commander Stockmann, a Jew. Forced labour at Heinkel Werke. Obersturmführer Tauscher replacing the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing was more lenient, had only two men shot, when a prisoner escaped instead of ten, etc. Conditions improved much when at the end of the year 1943, the camp changed from a Judenlager to a K.Z. (p.3). Transfer to Mielec; twelve hours’ daily work in a factory; nearly no food; filth and vermin unbearable. With 20,000 other prisoners, the author was working in an aircraft factory at Flossenburg, Bavaria (p.6). In the same year, many Hungarian Jews arrived. On a week’s march towards Dachau, the Jewish prisoners were machine-gunned from the air most of the time; many died from exhaustion and starvation. 8.

Manfred Heymann lived with Manfred Heymann's parents and Manfred Heymann's sixteen-year-old brother Eugen, in Stettin. On February 13, 1940, the Heymann family, including the 76-year-old grandmother who was living with the Heymann family, was this transport by the Gestapo to be”evacuated” to Poland. the whole family, including the 76-year-old grandmother who was living with them were allowed to take one suitcase each. On this transport all the Stettin Jews were taken, only “Mischlinge” being left. The three to five thousand people were transported in trains, fairly well treated and fed adequately on this transport. But as the carriages were unheated, and it was a bitterly cold winter, the older people especially suffered greatly. On arrival at Krakow, the older people were herded like cattle to the Lipowa P.O.W. Camp. the older people's luggage had been put in separate vans and none of Their luggage was ever returned to the older people. At the Lipowa P.O.W. Camp the older people remained for one day. Then the transport was divided into three sections. The first went to Piaski, the second to Glusk and the third, which included the Heymann family, to Belsyce. The journey to Belsyce was made in sledges and Manfred Heymann remembers this as a nightmare. They took all day to cover the 24 km. in the bitter cold and snow. Many people, including Manfred Heymann, were frost-bitten. A little girl on the same sledge as Manfred Heymann was so badly frost-bitten that on arrival at Belsyce all A little girl on the same sledge as Manfred's fingers and toes had to be amputated. Manfred Heymann's grandmother suffered terribly and died soon after their arrival at Belsyce. The Polish Jews living in Belsyce had been told of the transport’s imminent arrival and were prepared to deal with the problem of a sudden increase in the population of Belsyce. Belsyce had between seven and eight thousand inhabitants, of whom about 4000 were Jews. At this time the Germans did not interfere greatly with the Polish Jews’ lives. the Polish Jews’ still had the Polish Jews’'s little shops round the market place and were able to carry on the Polish Jews’'s trade undisturbed. However there was considerable anti-Semitism among the non-Jewish Poles - sometimes, Manfred Heymann feels, with considerable justification, for the Jews cheated the Jews's gentile neighbours right and left. The new inhabitants were billeted on families of Polish Jews who were most hospitable and helpful. The Heymann family stayed with a shoemaker, Lipa Tepper, who was very kind to the Heymann family. The German Jews soon organised The German Jews. A committee was formed on which the leading members were Dr. Flater, Herr Dombrower, Herr Bauchwitz. A kitchen was set up with Heymann in charge whilst Mrs Heymann cooked. Clothes supplied by The German Jews were distributed. the Heymann family were also helped by parcels of food - 2 - and clothes sent to the Heymann family by friends from Germany. A teacher, Mr Prager of Cracow, was engaged by Heymann to teach Manfred Heymann and Dr. Flater's sons. Up to the end of the same year the Jews were allowed to work and conditions were not bad. Nо worse outrages occurred than a drunken SS man putting a Jew’s beard off. In the winter of the same year the Jews had to close the Jews's shops. All the Jews's goods were confiscated and All their goods were not allowed in the Market Place - which meant in fact that the Jews could no longer carry on the Jews's trades. Now the Polish anti-Semitism began to come out into the open. their shops were immediately taken over by Poles. In the same year a Judenrat was formed by the SS with Mr Bauchwitz in charge, as Mr Bauchwitz in charge spoke German and could deal with the Germans. the SS also formed an “Ordnungs Polizei”, a Jewish police, whose main job was to keep Jews off the Market Place. Manfred Heymann's brother, Eugen joined an “Ordnungs Polizei”, a Jewish police, whose main job was to keep Jews off the Market Place. 8pm curfew was instituted for the Jews. Heavy fines were imposed on any Jew infringing 8pm curfew. Any Jew hiding goods from Any Jew hiding goods from his former shop's former shop was liable to be shot. Kosher slaughter was forbidden on pain of death. There was one traitor among the Jews, by name of Goldstein, whom the SS put on a Judenrat as a reward for Goldstein, whom the SS put on the Judenrat as a reward for his betrayals's betrayals. The first shooting probably due to information given to the Germans by Goldstein, whom the SS put on the Judenrat as a reward for his betrayals was when a Jew was caught at Kosher slaughter. Gradually the incidents increased. Drunken the SS men would shoot or maltreat old Jews Drunken SS men found in the streets. But at this time the Gestapo was still bribable. A rich Jew who was arrested for some offence could still get off with a heavy bribe, whilst the Gestapo Kommissar was friendly to a Judenrat and was bribed as a matter of course. In Autumn the same year the SS selected the first Jews to be sent to the “Judenlager” Poniatow. the “Judenlager” Poniatow was surrounded by the SS. All the young men were driven into the Market Place. Some were selected, others released. Old Jews were shot out of hand. The second batch was selected in a similar way in Winter, the same year, and sent to “Judenlager” Majdanek. Now a Ghetto was established in Belsyce. Jews from all the surrounding villages had to come to Belsyce and live in certain streets. By the beginning of the same year, one third of the Jews had gone - either on transports to other camps or killed. The Heymanns were fortunate in being protected by Eugen in the Ordnungs Dienst. In general, the Ordnungs Dienst was able to help The Heymanns's brethren by warning their brethren before arrests and selections. But the Poles were prepared to betray the Jews at any time for a reward from the Germans. Fifty percent of the Jews in Belsyce lived in hiding. The most ingenious hideouts were invented, especially by the Polish - 3 - Jews. Tunnels were dug under rooms, cellars blocked in, trap-doors built in wardrobes. The German Jews, not used to this kind of existence were unfortunately always the first to report when there were selections by the Germans. Meanwhile The German Jews had guards posted on the Lublin road who would warn The German Jews of the approach of the Germans. By the time the SS arrived, usually not a Polish Jew was to be found. At one of these selections the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing was taken to Majdanek, but managed to escape and return to Belsyce. In Spring the same year all the Belsyce Jews were taken to camps. The Heymanns again succeeded in staying behind by bribing the SS. But the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing was taken once more. Outside Belsyce, the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing jumped off the lorry with some other members of the Ordnungs Dienst who has also has been taken. some other members of the Ordnungs Polizei who has also has been taken were shot by the SS, but the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing got away. the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing was hidden that day by the regular German police, stationed in that area fighting the resistance. Apart from The Heymanns's the only Jews left in Belsyce were those in hiding. Those the SS did not take to camps were shot. All those in the hospital were killed. After the SS had left, the Jews remaining went round Belsyce collecting the Jews remaining's dead and burying them. the SS made the Jews remaining collect the Jews remaining's furniture and belongings and put the Jews’ furniture and belongings in the Jewish school and the Synagogue. Meanwhile, the Poles joined in the plundering of former Jewish homes. Of the SS Manfred Heymann remembers that the worst sadists were among the Ukranian the SS privates, who raped women and committed the most horrible atrocities. In Summer, the same year, the Germans decided to leave the remaining Belsyce Jews in a camp there. Orders were issued that any Jew found outside a camp there after a certain date would be shot. A few Jews stayed in hiding with Polish friends, a few joined the Partisans in the woods. But this was only possible with the Communist Partisans, as the Communist Partisans gave any Jews the Communist Partisans found up to the Germans. In Winter of the same year, the SS announced that any Jews still in hiding could come into a camp there. As it was impossible to live outside a camp there, the remaining Belsyce Jews came into a camp there. Then came the next selection of 200 to go to Poniatow “Judenlager”. The whole camp had to march past the the SS Commander and the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing was lucky enough to get to the barracks without being picked out, and thought the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing was safe. But the SS found that the SS had selected too few and the SS Commander came into the barracks to find some more. the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing was picked, but a member of the Ordnungs Dienst told the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing to slip into a room off the main hall. This saved the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing, for later that day all the children and old people were shot in the cemetery outside Belsyce. Only one little boy came back, saved as if by a miracle, with a bullet-wound in Only one little boy's hand. - 4 - That same winter two men appeared in the camp who had escaped from an extermination саmp. This was the first the Belsyce Jews had heard of such camps. the two men were Warsaw Jews. the two men had been taken by train to a camp in the East. The last stage of the journey was covered in a train consisting of cattle wagons with 80 to a wagon, half of whom suffocated before the two men reached a camp there. On the last part of the journey through a forest, the SS took over from the train drivers. When the train drivers arrived, a Jew came to meet the train drivers and told the train drivers that there was nothing to fear - that the train drivers would just have a bath and would then be resettled elsewhere. The prisoners were unloaded and made to undress. Each received a ticket for his clothes and a piece of soap. The prisoners were then herded into shower-baths. The doors were shut and shower-baths turned on, but instead of water shower-baths produced gas. After a short time, when the SS knew that The prisoners were dead, the floor of shower-baths caved in and the bodies fell into trolleys which took the bodies to the Jewish school. No one ever left these camps alive. the SS were never granted leave. The day after the two men arrived, the two men were caught and shot by the SS and left for the Jews to bury. But although the two men were shot in many places, the two men were not dead. The camp Jewish doctor, Mosbach, patched the two men up and the two men survived. In Winter, 1941 the greater part of the camp was liquidated by the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing. 300 men and 100 women were taken to Belsyce, the rest were shot, most of 300 men and 100 women by Veiks the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing. 300 men and 100 women were forced to dig 300 men and 100 women's own graves, stand in front of their own graves to be shot down. Then the other Jews had to bury 300 men and 100 women. Some of 300 men and 100 women were still alive when Some of the shot Jews were buried and the earth still moved after the grave had been closed. On this occasion many atrocities were committed. Manfred Heymann particularly remembers how some Ukranian the SS men found a little child in the street and chopped a little child's head off. The Heymanns left with the transport to Budzin, on which the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing took mainly German Jews, while most of the Polish Jews were killed at Belsyce. When they arrived at Belsyce, the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing sorted out more Polish Jews for extermination. the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing was a sadist who enjoyed killing. the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing would shoot a man the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing happened to meet because the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing did not like the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing's face. The food and living conditions at Belsyce were appalling. The prisoners were divided into working parties called “companies”. The prisoners worked at Poniatow “Judenlager”. When working parties called “companies” marched outpast Veik the first morning to go to work, the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing saw Dr. Flater with some other young boys at the back of the line and called some other young boys out. Dr. Flater and the others begged for Manfred and the others's lives, so the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing sent Manfred and the others to dig foundations for a block of flats being put up for German workers. At the end of the day the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing came to inspect Manfred and the others's work and was satisfied. So Manfred and the others were spared. The camp had been originally started for Jewish P.O.W.s - 5 - and the Jewish Lagerkommandant Stockmann was kind to The prisoners. the Jewish Lagerkommandant Stockmann arranged for some other young boys to work in The camp, and Dr. Flater worked the bellows for a blacksmith. Meanwhile, Mrs Heymann peeled potatoes in the camp kitchen and Dr. Flater was able to see Mrs Heymann frequently. Later Mrs Heymann did housework for a German worker from Poniatow “Judenlager” and was able to smuggle food back into The camp for a German worker from the factory. Old people in The camp were shot or sent to extermination camps. Anyone caught with jewelry or money was shot. Whenever anyone escaped, 10 others were shot. If the escapee was caught the escapee was shot or hanged depending on the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing's mood or desire for a public spectacle. People who brought in bread were flogged publicly. Bauchwitz, a company leader, was hanged for telling someone in the factory where Bauchwitz, a company leader worked about conditions in The camp. The factory guards regularly searched the prisoners who worked there. Most of the prisoners who worked there had made Most of the prisoners food containers. One Warsaw Jew had made One Warsaw Jew With a double bottom, in which One Warsaw Jew kept gold. One day One Warsaw Jew left a double bottom, in which he kept gold on One Warsaw Jew's bench at Poniatow “Judenlager” and the Werkschutz discovered gold. That night at The camp One Warsaw Jew was undressed and every prisoner had to beat One Warsaw Jew. the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing then finished the job by beating the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing to death personally. When three members of Mr Heymann’s company escaped, 30 members of Mr Heymann’s company had to lie completely still in the yard all night. Anyone who moved was beaten by the guards with the guards with their rifle butts's rifle butts. the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing survived this and was allowed into hospital. The rule in hospital was that anyone still there after a fortnight was shot. So the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing came out after a fortnight. the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing met the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing and told the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing did not look well enough to be out of hospital - told the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing to go back! Eventually, the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing was transferred to the Eastern Front and the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing's reign of terror at Belsyce was over. The new commandant, Obersturmfuehrer Tauscher, was more lenient. When a prisoner escaped, only two were shot instead of ten. Camp discipline was slightly relaxed and it was possible to smuggle in bread without fear of penalty. At the end of the same year, the camp was changed from a “Judenlager” to a Konzentrationslager. Although this meant that the Jews's hair was shorn and the Jews had to wear striped clothes, the general conditions improved greatly overnight. The food was better. People were no longer shot when there was an escape. At this time there was one successful escape, when the escapees stole guns from the Werkschutz at Poniatow “Judenlager” and another when Jewish partisans drove up to the camp dressed as the SS and removed a prisoner from under the SS's nose. - 6 - Soon after the camp became a KZ, half the prisoners were sent to Mielec and The Heymanns were with this transport. Here The Heymanns had to work 12 hours a day in the factory whilst The Heymanns's only food was a small quantity of Sauerkraut. the camp was vermin ridden and the prisoners slept on bare boards as the straw was too filthy. The oldest man in the camp was 50 and only the toughest survived. the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing became weaker and weaker. In the same year all the prisoners were tattooed prior to being moved on to Wielizka, due to the Russian advance. Here all the prisoners remained for only a week and then were transported to KZ Flossenbuerg in Bavaria. At KZ Flossenbuerg in Bavaria the food was better. all the prisoners again worked in an aircraft factory. The Jews were in a minority in the camp. Altogether there were some 20 000 prisoners with 1000 to each block. The Block Leaders were mostly German criminals. The one in charge of Manfred Heymann's block was a murderer. The various prisoners had to wear different tabs, so that the guards could distinguish The various prisoners easily. The Politicals prisoners wore green; Criminals, red; Smugglers and black marketeers, black; “Bibelforscher”, lilac; POWs wore POWs's country’s initials; Germans wore triangles; The Germans in the camp were better treated and The Germans in the camp and the Czechs were allowed to receive food parcels. The Germans told the new arrivals that the camp had been hewn out of the rock by communist and social democrat prisoners. Mrs Heymann had not come to the camp with The Germans but had remained in Poland. Mrs Heymann eventually went to Belsen, which Mrs Heymann survived. After liberation Mrs Heymann went to Sweden, but was suffering from ТВ, of which Mrs Heymann died in 1947. In the same year, in Belsyce, new transports of Jews came from Hungary. Although there were no shootings in the camp, many died of starvation and exhaustion. In November the same year, Manfred Heymann's father went to the camp hospital. Manfred’s father was discharged after some time as cured, but died a few days later. As experiments were carried out on the prisoners in the camp hospital, Manfred Heymann believes that Manfred’s father was poisoned. In January the same year, Eugen was taken off to another camp. Manfred Heymann never heard of Eugen again. By March the same year, the conditions and food in the camp had deteriorated. But the prisoners’ morale was higher, because the prisoners’ knew that the end was in sight. American and Russian airmen were shot almost daily in the camp prison. In April, a fortnight before liberation, the Jews were taken off in a transport. - 7 - probably intended for Dachau. The train in which the Jews were, was machine-gunned by American planes, who, presumably, thought they were a troop transport. Some prisoners managed to escape in the confusion of the raids. Any who tried to get off The train in which the Jews were to escape the machine-gunning were shot by the Germans; any who were injured were killed by the Germans anyway. After two days of this, no locomotive could be found to take The train in which the Jews were on and the transport started marching on foot There was bread and water for one day. After bread and water for one day, no more food of any kind. The march continued for a week, with people dying right and left from exhaustion and starvation. The march was made even harder by the fact that the Jews were wearing wooden-soled shoes. On the first day, the Jews were again attacked from the air. After this the Jews marched at night, and slept in the woods during the first day. Even then, the Jews were machine-gunned when they built a fire. Finally, the SS guards marched the prisoners through a village where the SS guards heard that the Americans had caught up with the prisoners. the SS guards then left the prisoners in a wood beyond a village where they heard that the Americans had caught up with them and disappeared. A few of the prisoners, including the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing, now decided to return to a village where they heard that the Americans had caught up with them in search of food, at the risk of being caught and shot by Germans. Some of the other prisoners followed the SS guards, who shot Some of the other prisoners. But the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing and the camp leader, SS Oberscharführer Veiks, a sadist who enjoyed killing's companions reached a village where they heard that the Americans had caught up with them without interference from the Germans who were by now too busy saving the Germans who were by now too busy saving their skins to worry about anything else's skins to worry about anything else. Manfred and his companions were given bread. Then, at last, Manfred and his companions found the Americans and were safe.

5,"['During roll-call in January 1943 the witness saw Dr. Clauberg who had come to select 50 women. The purpose of this was unknown to the prisoners, but the witness who had been in Auschwitz since 1942 and was so desperate that the witness volunteered. 50 women had to undress, and when the witness answered the question as to whether the witness menstruated in the negative, the witness was sent back. A few days later the witness heard that a new block was being established where nurses were wanted, but rumours had it that the witness would have to collaborate with the SS so the witness did not apply. the witness obtained work in the camp laundry and in the course of the witness's work heard about the dreadful experiments being carried out in Block 10. Knowledge about the dreadful experiments being carried out in Block 10 and the dreadful experiments being carried out in Block 10's fatal results gradually spread, and panic broke out whenever the witness appeared. the witness therefore frequently choose the witness's victims from among the newly arriving transports. Later, Block 10 was re-sited and completely isolated behind barbed wire. It was not far from the staff building where the witness worked and the witness often heard screeming and moaning. the witness and all the others knew that transfer to Block 10 meant certain death. 9.

Evidence of identity: Citizen identity card No. 267692 Series PN-52, issued MOVB, Prague 11, 6. 2. 1956 Evidence reference VB 1942/56. Testimony heard in criminal proceedings against the witness. The witness was duly advised of The witness right under § 108 of the Penal Code to refuse to testify; likewise of the importance of witness testimony in the public interest, and of the consequences under § 109 of the Penal Code of making false statements in evidence; likewise of the opportunity that would be afforded under § 112 of the Penal Code to correct the minutes in accordance with her evidence. I think it was in January 1943, when we were paraded for roll-call, that a man in civilian clothes came, who I found out later was Dr. Clauberg. We were told the witness would select 50 women, but for what purpose was not disclosed. I myself had been in Auschwitz since about March 1942. The situation in Auschwitz was so dreadful that the impression would arise, immediately anyone in civilian clothes arrived, as in this case, that the purpose for which 50 women were being selected could not possibly be worse than the situation in Auschwitz. I was among those who volunteered, and five of us were brought before the witness. We were made to strip, and were asked by the witness whether we menstruated. On hearing my reply that this was not the case, the witness sent me away. Even at the time we felt this was strange. A few days later one of 50 women came - 2 - and reported that a block was being prepared inside the men’s camp in Auschwitz, a block was Block No. 10, and that they required nurses there and that I could volunteer. I knew another prisoner who at one time had managed the laundry facilities, and as I thought another prisoner who at one time had managed the laundry facilities would be better informed on the matter I asked another prisoner who at one time had managed the laundry facilities's advice as to whether or not I should volunteer as a nurse for a block. another prisoner who at one time had managed the laundry facilities advised me against this, because it would be something that involved some kind of contact with the SS, and in the event of Auschwitz ever being dispersed the SS would execute us, because we had knowledge of things that would be awkward for the SS. Later on, I found myself in the Staff building, where I worked in the laundry. the Staff building, where I worked in the laundry was between Birkenau and Auschwitz. The girls who worked there or had The girls who worked there or had their accommodation there's accommodation there also went to the men’s camp in Auschwitz. In this way we soon learned what was happening in a block. a block was experimentation on women, being carried out there by the witness. It was now that I established that the civilian who had been selecting women earlier was the same man. We gradually got to hear more and more about the ghastly things they were doing in a block, i.e. the experiments on women mentioned earlier. We found out that mass deaths of women were happening during and after the experiments on women mentioned earlier. This information spread through Auschwitz. As a result there was immediate panic and scenes whenever the witness came to Auschwitz to select women. 50 women knew from others about the atrocities being committed in Block No. 10, i.e. the experiments on women mentioned earlier, and wanted above all not to be taken there, even though conditions in Auschwitz were unbearable. For preference the witness would take women direct from the transports, but if the witness did not get a sufficient number there the witness would pick out further women in Auschwitz. I know that later a block was moved to another location. this point was shortly before the evacuation of Auschwitz. At this point they cordoned a block off behind barbed wire, but a block was not far from the Staff building, where I myself worked, and often we heard screams and groaning coming from where 50 women were kept. From the accounts being passed on in Auschwitz at this time I know that women from a block were sent back to Auschwitz, and would shortly afterwards die there as a result of women from Block No. 10's physical condition. I also know that women from Block No. 10 were divided up between different places so that women from Block No. 10 would not be together as a group. I know from prisoners on so-called work deployment that a certain number of women from the witness Block No.10 were sent back to Auschwitz, and that those unable to work after those unable to work after their return's return were sent to the gas chambers immediately. Those who did work could usually only keep going for about three to four days. This meant that, for 50 women, being sent back by the witness was synonymous with a death sentence. I knew some nurses and talked to some nurses quite often, e.g. - 3 - Rija Hans, and some nurses told me that in a block the most dreadful things were being done, and that if the witness so much as appeared in a block and was seen by 50 women it would drive 50 women completely out of 50 women's minds for fear of the experiments. I know also that for example Sylvia Friedman worked in a block. Read, approved and signed.

6,"['Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was arrested together with 31 Jews and Poles and taken to the Gestapo to Prison St. Michael on 11 September 1939, where seven prisoners were shot instantly, the rest sent on to the Military prison Monte Lupich, to Skwochowice near Mähr. Ostrau, to the prison at Somorn and finally via Weimar to Buchenwald (horrible transport from 6-10 October 1939). In order to take vengeance on the Jews for the so-called “Bier-kellerputsch” in Munich, the Gestapo distributed no food from 7-11 November 1939, and after no food such food as to make everybody sick. Typhoid and spotted fever followed. On 15 January 1940, Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, and some hundred survivors of Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,'s group of originally 3,500 were transferred through the camp doctor to a special barracks, where political prisoners (among them was Ernst Thaelmann) took care of Mr Sattler and some hundred survivors of his group of originally 3,500 (p.2). Horrible ill-treatment through Kapos; SS-atrocities (p.2-3). Himmelfakrttransporte, 1940; twice saved through Lagerältester Jupp. Murder-camp for chemical experiments of I.G. Farben (p.3). Awful conditions on transport to Auschwitz of 300, 15 October 1942; 160 gassed at arrival. Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, escaped declaring Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, a locksmith. Ill-treatment at road-making. Dreams which came true (p.4-5). For a murder a man would get a reward of 3 days’ leave and vodka. The Ukrainan Black Guard was inhumanly cruel and dangerous (p.4). Most critically ill after a kick from an SS-man, in 1944, Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was operated on in a masterly way, evidently by a Jewish surgeon, but had to return back to work too early; Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, has been suffering all the time since and will have to undergo another operation. Death-march to Gleiwitz on 18 January 1945; horrid transport to Buchenwald 21 days’ march back to Poland; at Krakow, Poland Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, learned that 31 of Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,'s near relatives had been murdered by the Nazis. Remarried Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, lives in Melbourne (since 1950), where Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, runs a restaurant. 9.

Since 1936 Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, had been married to Frau Rena, née Fajner: they had a son Jerry (George) and a daughter Salomea. After the German troops occupied Krakow, Poland on 5th September 1939,the Gestapo arrested Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, on the 11th Sept. along with 31 Jews and Poles, mostly journalists and took 31 Jews and Poles, mostly journalists to the Polish prison, Sankt Michael (Saint Michael) which 1939,the Gestapo had taken over. During the second night 1939,the Gestapo fetched seven of the detainees from the cells and shot seven of the detainees; amongst seven of the detainees was an Orthodox Jew Herr Schickmann, and an Orthodox Jew Herr Schickmann's sons, 18 and 16 years old. From there the remaining captives were taken to the military jail Montelupich where the remaining captives were divided into different groups and subjected to gross ill-treatment. After Yom Kippur the remaining captives were transported to the Sammellager Skwochowice (near Ostrava)which had been converted from an old sugar refinery that had been de-commissioned; it possessed neither windows nor light, and where approximately 1,500 Jewish prisoners from Moravia, and some from Poland, had been rounded up. After a transitional stay of ten days in a normal prison (Somornj) a group consignment of 40 men to which Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, belonged were moved in closed cattle wagons; the openings intended for the cattle had been closed off through barbed wire; the journey to Buchenwald lasted for three days and three nights. the journey to KZ Buchenwald took a major detour; the journey to KZ Buchenwald stopped for one night in Wroclaw. On the 10th October 1939 - a Sunday - when the prisoners arrived in Weimar the prisoners were forced to march the long stretch, ten kms. uphill, to the KZ Buchenwald with hands on the prisoners's hands during which the the Gestapo escort struck the prisoners with rifle-butts without break. Those of the prisoners who broke down on the way were picked up by a truck that was following.In the KZ Buchenwald Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was placed in a tent camp which the Gestapo ironically dubbed, ”The Rose Garden”; a tent camp which the SS ironically dubbed, ”The Rose Garden” was the worst sort of place. 1,500 Jewish prisoners were herded together to which number came as well 2,000 Viennese Jews as a result of the so-called September Aktion. Although 1,500 Jewish prisoners had to work dreadfully hard in the quarry, 1,500 Jewish prisoners's subsistence after about a month was fit only for dogs. As a revenge for the so-called Bierkeller Putsch in Munich (November 1,500 Jewish prisoners were forced to go hungry for 94 hours during which the the Gestapo guards remarked: ‘You are supposed to die; that’s going too slowly!’ After that 1,500 Jewish prisoners were given some herb soup as well as rotten and acrid salted cucumbers, and when after that 1,500 Jewish prisoners drank water, epidemics broke out - dysentery and redwater fever from which 80-100 prisoners fell ill every day; a tent camp which the SS ironically dubbed, ”The Rose Garden” was ailing.On top of dysentery and redwater fever from which 80-100 prisoners fell ill every day came typhus and since 1,500 Jewish prisoners were gruesomely plagued by three different types of lice (i.e. clothing, hair and body lice), tick typhus as well. In spite of the snow and biting cold, the prisoners were obliged to live in mere tents – seven circus marquees with 500 men in each – from which the prisoners were collected to schlep stones; this went on until Dec. 1939 when the camp physician established a state of quarantine at mere tents – seven circus marquees with 500 men in each –, and would not allow the prisoners's inhabitants to go to work anymore.From 15th January 1940 the camp doctor took some hundreds of prisoners, those remaining of the original 3,500 and put some hundreds of prisoners, those remaining of the original 3,500 in a special hut inside the sickbay area where some hundreds of prisoners, those remaining of the original 3,500 were better treated and given food thanks to the solicitude of the political prisoners working there, one of whom was Ernst Thälmann (leader of the KPD, German Communist Party). After the circus tents had been emptied, the camp’s doctor had the circus tents incinerated for reasons of hygiene. Whereas Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, had weighed 81 kilos when arrested, Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,'s body weight by now was down to 38 kilos when Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was taken into the sickbay. Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,'s stomach had shrunk so much that Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, could only keep down two to three spoons of the camp’s's evening meal.During the first period of Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,'s imprisonment Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, lost eight teeth, three of which were knocked out by capos. After Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, had spent about two weeks in the sickbay, Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, reached a hut which was managed by the Block Senior Stephan Heinemann, a Communist, and of the original 300 inmates only about 50 remained. After Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, had worked some weeks in the stone quarry, an SS man threw Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, 11 metres downhill which broke a foot. When Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was treated in the sickbay - under the control of political prisoners - Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was placed in the Fahrkolonne (transport crew) consisting of 21 prisoners (capos included; one man on the trailer coupling) who instead of horses had to load stones, get rid of tree stumps, transport bricks, and deliver sand from the stone quarry for road building; to do so they themselves had to push heavy trucks.When Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, fell ill with pleurisy, Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was treated by a construction worker who possessed no medical knowledge; a construction worker who possessed no medical knowledge punctured a blister-like growth and drew out the pus, which flowed into a bowl held by an assistant. During that process a construction worker who possessed no medical knowledge noted that Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was behaving very bravely during the intervention. When Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, had to return to the Fahrkolonne, after some weeks Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, became so weak that Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was hardly able to mount the three steps to the Fahrkolonne. Through the gift of a cigarette, Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, obtained a few days respite before Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was again obliged to return to work.When on one occasion three or four prisoners, amongst three or four prisoners Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,, took a puff on a cigarette, an SS man caught and reported three or four prisoners, amongst them Herr Sattler whereupon each was hung by three or four prisoners, amongst them Herr Sattler's arms from a tree for half an hour. Although the torture took place on a cold autumn day, Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, became drenched with sweat, and after the tree-hanging Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, could not make use of Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,'s hands for six long weeks either for the food which Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, sipped: nor for the completion of the act of defecation because Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,'s tendons had become powerless. At the beginning of 1940 a new doctor at a tent camp which the SS ironically dubbed, ”The Rose Garden” put together the so-called ‘Himmelfahrt Transport’ (Ascension Day transport). 300-400 invalids in a tent camp which the SS ironically dubbed, ”The Rose Garden”, all Jews, were lined up in a death transport. At first the prisoners did not know what such transports entailed; when however the clothes of the inmates who had been sent away were returned, the prisoners knew what had happened. Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was saved from a transportation to death because the Block Senior Jupp, a Communist from Berlin, fetched Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, papers along with the documents of four other inmates in the sickbay with the result that Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, and the others’ names were not called by the roll-call for the allocation to the death transportation. When Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,, in order to get away from Buchenwald, volunteered for the office of a different camp, it was likewise the Block Senior Jupp, a Communist from Berlin, who advised Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, urgently not to, because a different camp was known as a death camp whereupon Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, resolved to remain (in Buchenwald Sattler learned that a different camp was an experiment-barracks belonging to I.G. Farbenindustrie ?in which the prisoners were subjected roughshod to life-threatening experiments.On the 16th October 1942 of the group of 350 Jewish prisoners, only 50 young people remained behind in Buchenwald so as to take part in a bricklaying training course whereas the other 300,amongst only 50 young people Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,, were sent to Auschwitz in closed cattle wagons on a journey lasting three days. During a journey lasting three days the other 300,amongst them Herr Sattler were given no food, and in each of those totally overfilled cattle-wagons only a single bucket was available for urination and defecation. only a single bucket was completely unsuitable in size for the passengers to eliminate the passengers's faeces; as a result the passengers had no choice but to soil the passengers in a sickening manner even if the deprivation of food and drink had a retarding affect on the functioning of the passengers's digestive and excretory organs. After the passengers had arrived in Auschwitz (18th October 1942), the passengers were sorted into groups during the following day: 160 of the 300 were sent at once to be gassed, while 140 remained. Herr Sattler was Herr Sattler who replied to a question by claiming Herr Sattler was a welder and 30 years old and so saved Herr Sattler; because business people and intellectuals were immediately liquidated. Since Herr Sattler knew that those who had a trade useful in a tent camp which the SS ironically dubbed, ”The Rose Garden” lasted longer, Herr Sattler registered voluntarily as an electrician for Herr Sattler hoped to be employed in the installation of electric cables in the barracks; however Herr Sattler was allocated to the putting up of high voltage transmission lines. Herr Sattler slipped off during the putting up of high voltage transmission lines, and could not do any further work because Herr Sattler's hands were completely battered and weak. When Herr Sattler then came to road construction, a terribly hard time for Herr Sattler ensued in which an the Gestapo man seriously wounded Herr Sattler by a blow with a rifle-butt. After that Herr Sattler was employed as electrician and welder in the BUNA factory.In the night of 13th March 1942, Herr Sattler had an appalling dream: Herr Sattler saw in an appalling dream very clearly how Herr Sattler's wife and Herr Sattler's children were being followed on the street; Herr Sattler's son’s blond hair was sticky with blood. When Herr Sattler awoke in the middle of the night of 13th March 1942, a camp comrade said to Herr Sattler, ‘What is the matter with Herr Sattler, Herr Sattler, Herr Sattler screamed so terribly in Herr Sattler's sleep?’ In reply Herr Sattler narrated the content of Herr Sattler's dream. After the war Herr Sattler learned from a Polish female servant who had earlier been in Herr Sattler's employ , and whom Herr Sattler later met in Krakow, Poland, that on Saturday 13th March, 1942, that is at the same time as Herr Sattler had an appalling dream, the Krakow, Poland ghetto had been liquidated during which Herr Sattler's wife and Herr Sattler's children perished.In particular Herr Sattler emphasised that events in the war led to reactions affecting the fates of the KZ prisoners: each victory by the Nazis – for example the conquest of Krakow, Poland, Mussolini’s entry in the war, or the capture of Crete – was so-to-speak a defeat for the KZ prisoners because the Gestapo then felt less restrained than ever in treating the KZ prisoners with appalling brutality. If one of the KZ prisoners was murdered with some excuse or other, the SS man would be given vodka and three days holiday. Just as dangerous as the Gestapo were the so-called Black Guard of the Ukrainians which consisted of 17 or 18-year-old fellows; the so-called Black Guard of the Ukrainians which consisted of 17 or 18-year-old fellows; they were as stupid as they were inhumanly cruel were as stupid as the so-called Black Guard of the Ukrainians which consisted of 17 or 18-year-old fellows; they were as stupid as they were inhumanly cruel were inhumanly cruel. On the basis of Herr Sattler's experiences Herr Sattler declared that Herr Sattler was convinced that any animal who had experienced the burden of suffering which the KZ inmates were subjected to, would have long ago been broken..In 1944 an SS man gave Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, a brutal kick in an SS man's stomach; an SS man realised a brutal kick in his stomach had serious consequences in an SS man's abdomen; an SS man was then in a critical state for weeks after without being allowed to report to the sickbay. When however an SS man then collapsed and could neither swallow nor eat, nor walk, an SS man managed to makecontact with friends of an SS man's in the sickbay where a Communist, Silmann (from Częstochowa) admitted an SS man; at that time a number of Jewish medical specialists were working there.When on the 20th June 1944 Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was operated on, Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, was already in a highly critical condition. The surgeon after opening the abdominal cavity, established that 1/3 of Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,'s stomach, gallbladder and duodenum were already septic; The surgeon removed his stomach, gallbladder and duodenum by mean of a surgical intervention. After that Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, through the use of a half-litre of ether fell ill with pneumonia in both lungs.Sadly Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, has completely forgotten the name of The surgeon. On the other hand Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, recalls the names of two of the assisting doctors: Dr Budziavrek from Krakow, Poland, and Dr Silber from the Ruhrgebiet.It is thanks to the excellent reputation which Herr Sattler enjoyed in the camp that The surgeon carried the operation out at all; afterwards The surgeon told Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,: ‘Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,, for anybody else, The surgeon would have simply stitched Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, up’ i.e. let Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, die because Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,'s case was hopeless. Herr Sattler was one of the so-called “Old 68ers” i.e. Herr Sattler had the number 68652 whereby Herr Sattler belonged to the group of prisoners originating from Buchenwald, whom the Gestapo ironically dubbed the “old battlers”.Although Herr Sattler stayed alive due to the operation, Herr Sattler was released too early from the sickbay and sent back to work. As a result, the stitches in Herr Sattler's stomach burst and even today Herr Sattler's abdomen has still only partially healed; only another operation - which Herr Sattler has still not been able to have – would resolve those medical issues. Because of the physical abuse Herr Sattler suffered, Herr Sattler has become 70% invalided.When the Buna Factory was liquidated on the 18th January 1945, the group of 350 Jewish prisoners were forced to undertake a Todesmarsch (death march) to Gliwice lasting two days and a night without any food during which many died underway. Herr Sattler attributes Herr Sattler's survival during both a Todesmarsch (death march) to Gliwice lasting two days and a night without any food during which many died underway and the entire period of suffering to a curious dream which Herr Sattler had during the beginning of Herr Sattler's time in Buchenwald: Herr Sattler's father who had died a year earlier appeared to Herr Sattler in his father who had died a year earlier's dream and shook his father who had died a year earlier's hand, and said to Herr Sattler: ‘Herr Sattler are going to survive!’ Herr Sattler reported that this experience in Herr Sattler's dream gave Herr Sattler the spiritual power to survive everything.Those prisoners who managed to reach Gliwice – amongst the group of 350 Jewish prisoners Herr Sattler – had to travel back to Buchenwald eight days and eight nights in an open coal wagon without any cover or food and drink; as a result Herr Sattler was completely exhausted and could no longer move Herr Sattler's feet. However thanks to Herr Sattler's friends, Herr Sattler could find a place in the sickbay of Buchenwald where Herr Sattler was able to remain until American troops on the 14th April 1945 the liberation Buchenwald's surviving inmates . Before the liberation some hundreds of prisoners had yet to undertake a Todesmarsch.When Herr Sattler left there on the 7th May 1945 Herr Sattler was personally convinced that no member of Herr Sattler's family was still living. But since Herr Sattler held it to be Herr Sattler's duty and obligation to find out the exact facts, Herr Sattler walked 500 kms in a group of three for 21 days in springtime on a long way round towards Krakow, Poland; the three men only fed the three men underway on some lettuces and potatoes. From Gliwice Herr Sattler was able to travel by train to Krakow, Poland; when Herr Sattler arrived there Herr Sattler made Herr Sattler's way to the cemetery; the marble of the burial places had been stolen, and as an aftermath of Herr Sattler's suffering Herr Sattler was seized with a suicidal mood. Nevertheless Herr Sattler pulled Herr Sattler together and recalled an address which a Pole had given Herr Sattler when Herr Sattler had suffered from a broken foot in Buchenwald. On the way there, by chance Herr Sattler met a Polish slaughterer whom Herr Sattler told that Herr Sattler had met a Polish slaughterer in Buchenwald whereupon a Pole invited Herr Sattler to a Pole's house where Herr Sattler stayed an hour and drank vodka.Herr Sattler found out that 31 members of Herr Sattler's family – amongst 31 members of his family – amongst them his wife, his mother, his brother, a nephew who was a doctor Herr Sattler's wife, Herr Sattler's mother, Herr Sattler's brother, a nephew who was a doctor – had been murdered by the Nazis.Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, then spent three years in Wroclaw which was under Polish rule where Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, founded a large metal ware shop which still exists today though in nationalised form. In 1947 Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, married again in Wroclaw which was under Polish rule where he founded a large metal ware shop which still exists today though in nationalised form; Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,'s second wife, née Fass is a trained biologist. Herr Sattler and his wife had two sons, Stephan and Albert. In 1949 Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, and Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,'s wife went to Vienna, and from Vienna after six months Herr Sattler and his wife emigrated to Melbourne, Poland; Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, arrived there on 3rd May 1950, and since then has run a restaurant in which Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland,'s second wife works with Mr Sattler, a well-to-do merchant in Krakow, Poland, assiduously.

7,"[""The author witnessed the heartrending scenes during the selections for the mass deportations to Duenamünde. In a poignant manner The author describes how first the rumour of a new camp with good conditions was spread by the SS among the starving people of the Riga Ghetto. Then, on 26 February 1942, a roll-call of the entire population of the Riga Ghetto was ordered and after repeated counts and hours of waiting in the freezing cold, the Camp Commander, whip in hand, appears and tells the horror-stricken crowd of the new camp and the new camp's excellent equipment. the Camp Commander then callously proceeds to select 2,500 persons for Duenamünde. 2,500 persons are ordered to report the next morning. On 27 February 1942, early in the morning, heavy lorries arrive, and at great speed and with many brutalities the victims are loaded onto the victims. At the last moment the Camp Commander and the Camp Commander's minions at random seize another 100 persons and push another 100 persons on heavy lorries. Hardly an hour later heavy lorries return, empty but for the clothing of the owners who have gone to the owners who have gone to their mass grave Dünamünde's mass grave Duenamünde. Duenamünde Yonder, where the wide stream of the Duena flows into the waters of the North Sea like a cornucopia, one finds on the flat beach and on the brim of spacious woodland that stretches down the cost, many isolated farmhouses and small sttlements, whose inhabitants mainly earn these people's livelihood by fishing and by cultivating the rich grassland and the fertile fields. The war brought many hardships to these people, but at the time when our tragedy took place there, these people had not been troubled with actual combat scenes and the general horrors of war. Ships of the Battle Fleet cruised the sea, and sometimes one could see speeding vessels in the distance whose grey or black smoke trail lingered on the horizon long after speeding vessels had disappeared. Units of the German Navy were posted as sentries along the coast, and frequently the sound of whistling shots could be heard, which had been fired from machine guns and small cannons at enemy aircraft flying over the district. This took place from February 1942 until the end of 1943 on the soil of Latvia, yonder where the Duena flows into the sea. The serene calm of this peaceful landstrip was at that time ingeniously used by the SS Command. the SS Command decided to propagate the idea “Duenamuende”. Cunningly the SS Command allowed rumours to spread, that approximately 20 kilometres from the Ghetto of Riga, lay the Port of Duenamuende, and that there a few thousand people would be taken into newly errected comfortable camps. The Jewish orderlies appointed by the SS in the Riga Ghetto, were instructed and ordered to mention Duenamuende to everyone in the the Ghetto of Riga quarters Duenamuende was supposed to be a lovely spot, on the coast. Many people were needed there for work in the Labour Unit (Arbeitseinsatz). The new camp was said to be very clean and well planned, much better conditions and less overcrowded than the narrow unhygienic quarters of the Ghetto of Riga. The inmates of the Ghetto of Riga needed more room and improved conditions and some relief measures were necessary. The rumours about “Duenamuende” rapidly went from mouth to mouth and whilst many unattached people had become familiar with the idea of - 2 - being transferred to another camp, the majority of the the Ghetto of Riga inmates trembled for the majority of the Ghetto inmates's families - and the idea of separation and goodbye. It is the 26th February 1942. At 6 o'clock in the morning all the inmates of the Ghetto of Riga had to assemble. The house stewards, group leaders, the orderlies, the leaders of labour units, the leaders of columns, and finally the camp eldest all were made responsible for everyone being present. This also included all sick people. Those unable to walk and serious hospital cases are to be listed by names. All children have to be present and next to All children came the doctors and the medical service personnel. 30 degrees below zero. The hard frozen snow grates under the feet of many thousand people. An icy wind makes the eyes water and the cheeks are covered with layers of ice. Eyebrows and beards are covered with a crust of ice and seem snow bedecked. Most people are still hungry from the previous day. The orderlies race into every room and billet and press for extra speed. Frightened eyes and twitching faces show signs of fear and terror. Our instinct tells us to expect the worst. Slowly the quarters are emptied. many thousand people move in groups along the main street of the Ghetto of Riga, and it is difficult to move on as everywhere on the road there is nothing but pure slippery ice. Old parents are led by Old parents's children, small kids cling to the hands and coats of small kids's mother or father. Many people slip and fall, expecially when the SS appears. Many people is driven and chased to the greatest possible speed. Many are hit with butt-ends or kicked. the main street of the Ghetto cannot hold the masses. Therefore, a number of many thousand people are assembled in side streets. It takes some time before many thousand people are ordered into straight lines and in rows. Lists are produced. Names are read out. Everyone responsible is asked whether all are present. Then they count the people. One, twice, five times, again, eight times. Lists are compared and discussed. Several Scharfuehrer of the SS appear. Several Scharfuehrer of the SS too want to know many things and begin to ask questions. Then Several Scharfuehrer of the SS turn to the hospital doctors and instruct the hospital doctors which patients are to be got ready for the transport. Two hours have gone by since we were assembled. Men, women, children, the frail and the sick. the cold cramps the bodies. Faces, ears and feet hurt terribly. Children cry. Subdued, soft moaning, but audible nevertheless. A - 3 - woman falls down, A - 3 - woman has fainted. Another one over there and one just opposite. Now an elderly man falls and does not get up. an elderly man is shaken and pulled. A medical orderly races up. Dead! he says. “Put an elderly man in a ditch along the road.” “an elderly man can be removed later” says a Schafuehrer. Many collapse owing to the cold. The feet seem to freeze off. Despite orders a general trampling and moving of feet begins, because no one is able to stand still any longer. Many cry with cold. Stand still, is being bellowed again and again. Faces are smacked, and stomachs are punched. Three terrible hours have passed. It is 9 o’clock. At last the Camp Commander is heard...”Attention! Stand straight. Stand still.” A big saloon car passes the barrier at the entrance of the Ghetto of Riga. A big saloon car is full of the SS and slowly rolls along the main street. A big saloon car stops in front of the assembled Scharfuehrer who salute smartly. the Camp Commander is the first to alight from A big saloon car and to receive reports. “All assembled and present.” the Camp Commander and the Camp Commander's officers salute The commander and his officers's subalterns with “Heil Hitler”. The salute is repeated by the NCOs with arm raised stiffly. Then with half closed eyes the Camp Commander musters the long lines of unfortunate people. An officer takes snaps. An officer picks out “types” and lets “types” step forward; old, unshaven men in rags-miserable starved women. A young girl with a lovely face and hair, A young girl with a lovely face and hair is on the verge of collapse through the cold, but has to smile invitingly. An officer demands it. The dead man lying in a ditch is also being photographed. In the meantime the Camp Commander confers with the other officers and the Scharfuehrer, who have been called aside. At last the Camp Commander takes off one fur glove, puts up the collar of the Camp Commander's coat, pulls the Camp Commander's cap so that his cap forms a jaunty angle, unfolds a piece of paper and speaks.” Attention everybody”. Pause. Then a few subdued wimpers- followed by breath taking silence. The voice again.” You have undoubtedly all heard of “Duenamuende”. A new camp is to be started there. You will have modern clean billets In Duenamünde. Much better than here in the Ghetto of Riga. Not so cramped, much more comfrotable and cleaner. Many fishing nets need mending in Duenamünde, and tins are to be manufactured there. The work in Duenamünde is easy and a sedantry one. the Camp Commander therefore, mainly require elderly people who are unfit for heavy manual work. the Camp Commander shall supply you with doctors, - 4 - nursing personnel, medicine and dressing material. Of course everything else that goes with a camp will be given to you. Food will be sent to you from the Ghetto of Riga. Our lorry will call on you every day with provisions. You will find the new camp ready to receive you. No one is to take anything with the new camp, is that understood? the Camp Commander do not mind if you take some food, but nothing else, is that clear? Thus sounded the military, curt words of our superior, uttered in a rattling tone. Then with his staff he passed through the rows of people. “How old? Occupation? Hm, hm. Fall out to the left. You too, and you, and you and you.” Then, turning to one of the Scharfuehrer...... “and the rows of people there”. “Come here one of the Scharfuehrer.” “Over there those old women, all of those old women.” one of the Scharfuehrer: “Certainly Sir”. Commander “Here the front row and at the back there one of the Scharfuehrer. Yes, one of the Scharfuehrer. And there on Commander's right, the one with the cheeky face, let the blighter step forward.” Then turning round: “How old are doctor, doctor?” “69 doctor”, replied doctor. “Take one of the Scharfuehrer too” says Commander. “Scharfuehrer” Commander yells. “Yes Commander”. “Start counting them”. “Yes Commander.” After a while. “How many have Commander counted up to now?” “1,300, Sir”. “Ah, not nearly enough. Commander need many more for “Duenamünde”. “What is the matter with Commander?” “Commander work with Command Reichsbahn II Sir.” “Nonsense! Commander shall give them a younger bloke! Quick, quick fall out to the left, join the others. “What are Commander doing, you there at the back, the one with the high head! “Commander am a butcher, Commander work with the slaughterhouse command.” Then Commander's good days are over, join the others, quick, march. “And you Sarah, you Sarah are going to Duenamünde. Don’t pull such a stupid face. There are many more going there beside Commander. So don’t get excited.” Among those selected for Duenamünde, the Camp Commander see an old couple whom the Camp Commander know well. People from the Camp Commander's native country. A young woman slips out of A young woman's group marching on the opposite side, and joins her group. Glancing sideways the Camp Commander has noticed the incident. the Camp Commander plants the Camp Commander infront of her group and orders A young woman's “back to A young woman's row” at the same time the Camp Commander swings the Camp Commander's riding whip. A young woman is the daughter of the - 5 - two old people, and falling on A young woman's knees A young woman implores the Camp Commander to send A young woman to Duenamünde with A young woman's parents. the Camp Commander to A young woman: “If A young woman insist, the Camp Commander don’t care, but A young woman are making the biggest mistake of A young woman's life.” A young woman replies: “Please the Camp Commander, A young woman want to go.” the Camp Commander thinks for a few seconds, then: “Well the Camp Commander's child if my child must, the Camp Commander won’t stop my child.” At last even the “gentlemen” think it has lasted long enough. the Camp Commander and the Camp Commander's retinue feel the cold too much, and begin to feel uncomfortable. Now everything is done at the double. the Camp Commander in the Camp Commander's nasal voice: “You, you, you, you..... A young woman, that one, that one and that one”......wherever the Camp Commander's hand happens to point. In the end whole rows are the selection out of her group and destined for “Duenamuende”. Thus 2,500 people are collected. An the SS camp leader speaks: “Those selected for the transport to Duenamünde have to gather on the assembly place tomorrow, early in the morning. Is that clear? The exact time will be made known during the day. Have Those selected for the transport to Duenamuende understood?”......... Then: “Fall out all of you, back to your quarters!”..... By now it is twelve o’clock, noon. Fear, worry and anxiety was in the hearts and showed on the faces of those who had not been selected. They could not show any emotion during the selection as the intense cold had frozen their features into immobility, but now they slowly began to come to life. Silently they drag themselves back to your quarters. Soon the streets are empty and deserted. Those who were hungry forget about it.... A car is heard to start and the noice of the engine slowly dies down in the distance. Death at “Duenamuende”. the 26th February 1942. For many the last day of their lives. It is less cold than on the previous day. Also the assembly time has been fixed for 8.30am. Even a pale morning sun greets the unfortunate ones who stand ready for the transport to “Duenamünde”. It has become very quiet in the Ghetto of Riga. All those employed have long ago left the camp with the camp's barbed wire enclosure, and in long columns, led and guarded by armed sentries, they have started their slave labour. For the time being they have escaped the selection for “Duenamünde”, - 6 - They have said goodbye to their beloved ones, to their friends and acquaintances; those heart rending handshakes, last embraces, words of good luck, glances trembling with fear, worry and anxiety and in some cases even showing a spark of hope, despite everything; all this they have already left behind them. The command “Duenamuende” is awaiting collection. Excited murmurs go from one to the other, eyes ask questions. We know what they are asking, what they would like to kniw, we know how they feel. Nobody can, however, give them the answer. Heavy lorries draw up. Heavy lorries wait. Heavy lorries's drivers and crew have been summoned to the commander. Doubtlessly Their drivers and crew are receiving last minutes orders and instructions A messenger announces: “the commander is coming.” Smoking a cigarette, and apparently in excellent mood, the commander arrives. He who loves to be called “King of Judea” during the commander's carousels and when drunk, appears with several SS Unterfuehrer. the commander enquires whether all are present and if verything is prepared for the transport to Duenamuende. the commander does not even bother to glance at the waiting crows. Suddenly the commander decides to look personally into the quarters. Whip in hand the commander chases people before the commander whom the commander collected from working places, rooms and even the street. Fifty in all. Following the commander's example a few Scharfuehrer drive another hundred people together. another hundred people have to join another hundred people. The engines of the transport lorries are started. It won’t be long now. The first lorry pulls up. The first batch has to climb into The first lorry. In order to speed up matters, the SS Men in true SS-fashion help the people by beating, kicking and pushing the people. Greatest speed has been ordered and stern discipline the SS Men in true SS-fashion say. Hardly half an hour has gone by and all the vehicles are filled with people. More than 2.600 human beings have been loaded into the lorry caravans and are being driven away.... Very soon the passengers to “Duenamuende” will have vanished from our sight. 27th February 1942. Same morning. Hardly an hour later. All the vehicles which had just despatched More than 2.600 human beings are back again on the car park of the Ghetto of Riga. - 7 - all the vehicles are loaded with coats, frocks, suits, underwear and shoes. All these outer- wear garments have a yellow star bearing the inscription “JEW”. There are also many handbags, small parcels with bread and bottles filled with coffee among the things on the lorries. The owners of these articles are already in “DUENAMUENDE”. “DUENAMUENDE” is the name the SS gave to The owners of these articles's massgrave. DUENAMUENDE! DUENAMUENDE!

8,"[""A report written by an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935. an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 duly reported an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's return to the police, and after about 3 weeks an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 was interrogated at the Stapo offices, Alexanderplatz, Berlin. an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 declared that in Holland an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 had neither engaged in any political activities, nor kept contact with refugees. Under some pretext the interrogating official led an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 to the police prison for women, where Assessor Allass, the official in charge of Jewish emigration matters, signed a warrant for an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's arrest. an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 was told that an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 would be kept in preventive custody until being the scheduled transfer to Moringen to the ‘educational camp’ (Schulungslager) Moringen near Hanover. an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 was kept in a prison cell for 7 women, all classified as political suspects. One of 7 women, all classified as political suspects had returned from Brazil on doctor's orders, having contracted typhoid and yellow fever. The German consulate in Rio de Janeiro had paid half of an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's return passage. The police prison was clean, the treatment decent. Short visits from outside were permitted after a week. Two days before the scheduled transfer to the ‘educational camp’ (Schulungslager) Moringen near Hanover, i.e. on 9 April 1935, an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's mother succeeded in obtaining an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's release on the strength of a railway ticket to Amsterdam, on condition that an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 would leave Germany within 3 days. On 12 April 1935 an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's passport was returned to an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 at Bentheim on the German-Dutch frontier. Preventive Custody for a ‘Returnee’, 1935 On 1 February an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 went back to Germany via Zevesaar-Cranenburg. After an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 had registered with the police on 8 February an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 was summoned to appear at the STAPO (Staatspolizei, police headquarters, Alexanderplatz, Berlin). an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 was informed that this had been common procedure for some time without any consequences. To be on the safe side an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 contacted Dr Kreuzberger once again before going to Stapo, but Dr Kreuzberger had not heard anything about arrests or unpleasant consequences. an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 promised to let Dr Kreuzberger know how things went. On 22 February Stapo recorded in writing the statements an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 made on being interrogated by a detective superintendent. an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 stated that an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 had neither engaged in political activity abroad, nor was an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 a member of any party whatsoever; an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 had not contacted any refugees, did not know of any places where refugees used to meet, had not demanded any money from any committee for an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's journey home, etc. They asked an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 what foreigners thought about Germany. an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 answered that an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 had never cared about politics and had never discussed such topics. To their question about whether an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 had ever been kept in preventive custody or in a concentration camp an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 answered ‘No’. Meanwhile an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 could tell that they were asking various police stations in Berlin whether an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's passport was in order. Of course my passport was. Now an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 thought an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 would be allowed to go home, but instead an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 was led by an official through a labyrinth of corridors and staircases, and suddenly an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 read the words ‘police cell block’. an official pretended to need a signature and told an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 to go with an official. Assessor Allass, the official in charge of Jewish emigration matters, was just inspecting the women’s cell block and signed a warrant for an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's preventive custody. an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 was suddenly trapped. At an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's request to tell an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 why an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 was being arrested Assessor Allass, the official in charge of Jewish emigration matters, only answered, ‘an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 will be taken to the “educational camp” at Mooringen near Hanover and until then an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 will stay here.’ By entreating and begging Assessor Allass, the official in charge of Jewish emigration matters, an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 managed with the help of a little trick to make Assessor Allass, the official in charge of Jewish emigration matters, - 2 - at least inform an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's parents. After a thorough body search an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 was taken to a room shared by the women’s. the women’s were all political suspects so an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 knew straightaway that an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 was being treated as a political case. From the women’s an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 learnt that in another room there was a Jewess who had been living in Palestine for two years, had a Jewish husband and was now back in Berlin to visit a Jewess who had been living in Palestine for two years, had a Jewish husband and was now back in Berlin to visit her mother's mother. As a Jewess who had been living in Palestine for two years, had a Jewish husband and was now back in Berlin to visit her mother had wanted to earn some money in Berlin for a Jewess who had been living in Palestine for two years, had a Jewish husband and was now back in Berlin to visit her mother's journey home to Erez a Jewess who had been living in Palestine for two years, had a Jewish husband and was now back in Berlin to visit her mother had registered with the police, who put a Jewess who had been living in Palestine for two years, had a Jewish husband and was now back in Berlin to visit her mother straight into preventive custody. In an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's room there was another Jewess who had gone to Brazil with This woman's six-year-old son the year before, as This woman's husband had got a job there. This woman contracted typhoid and yellow fever, spent six months in a Brazilian hospital and was strongly advised by the doctors to return to Europe. The German consulate in Rio offered to pay 50 per cent of This woman's return passage. This woman was also kept in preventive custody, although This woman required more medical treatment immediately. They wanted to put her six-year-old son into an orphanage but her six-year-old son was allowed to stay with her six-year-old son's grandparents. Our ‘cases’ were increasing from day to day until there were ten Jewesses together in a separate room. Everything was spotlessly clean. At first the female guards were distant with us but later, when the female guards learnt from us why we were imprisoned, the female guards were really nice and humane. We were allowed to send post once a week (letters took one week within Berlin – really strict censorship). For example, an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 wrote to an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's parents that an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 had been arrested on the basis of a new regulation of 1 February 1935 which decreed that all Jewish emigrants returning from abroad were to be put into preventive custody. This sentence had been made illegible, and the next one too, in which an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 had written that we would be taken to the ‘educational camp’ (Schulungslager) Moringen near Hanover. After one week a first short visit of ten minutes was permitted. Meanwhile an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's parents had been to all the Jewish organisations in Berlin and had learnt that an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 was not the only who had been treated in this way. Then the woman from Palestine was my release on condition that This woman would return to Erez within three days. Although an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's case was different – people from Palestine are treated more generously in Germany – an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 told an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's mother at the next visiting time that the author's mother should immediately try to obtain an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's release by arguing that an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 would leave Germany - 3 - within a given timespan. It would take too much time to describe all the ways an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's mother now went about this. All this happened on Saturday 9 March. On Monday 11 April we were to be transported to the ‘educational camp’ (Schulungslager) Moringen near Hanover. an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 would like to point out that all these so-called ‘educational camps’ and ‘community camps’ were nothing but ordinary concentration camps which had recently been given new names. By Saturday 9 March an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's mother had succeeded in getting an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 out of prison, supplied with a ticket to Amsterdam. It was an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's last chance. It was completely uncertain how long an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 would have been in a concentration camp. At worst, one must reckon on a year. Obtaining release from a camp is much more difficult. an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 had to give back an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's warrant for the preventive custody and to sign another document which said that an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 would never be permitted to enter Germany again and that an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 would never make any claims on the Reich. Otherwise an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 would face preventive custody and a concentration camp. preventive custody and a concentration camp held on to an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's passport. an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 had three days left before an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's departure. an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 had to collect an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935's passport from a detective superintendent in Bentheim on the German-Dutch frontier. On the morning of 12 April an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 crossed the German-Dutch frontier, so an anonymous author, obviously a German Jewess, who returned from Holland to Germany on 1 Februry 1935 had been kept in preventive custody for sixteen days. Those [in custody] who had money on Those [in custody] who had money on them had to pay 1.50 RM per day. Of course, board and lodging were not worth that much, as we got the usual prison food: breakfast: 0.75 litres of acorn coffee without milk and sugar and for the first five days one slice of dry bread, later bread and jam. Lunch: dried vegetables made into soup or some other thick and very hot soup. In the evening: soup again and for the first five days dry bread, later bread and lard. Every day we were led, along with the other prisoners, around the prison courtyard for half an hour, in single file, keeping a distance of five feet apart. It was strictly forbidden to speak – otherwise, an isolation cell!!

9,"['Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin, was managing Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's own factory at the beginning of the Nazi regime. As Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin was no longer allowed to sell Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's goods to German enterprises Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin was forced to sell Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's factory. Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin started a retail business, but a retail business too was destroyed by boycott. In 1937 Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin emigrated to Sweden. Boycott against a Jewish War Widow in Stettin Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin comes from Mecklenburg. After getting married, Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin moved to Szczecin, where Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin lived until Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's relocation to Stockholm. Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's first husband, Mr Brotzen, died from complications caused by a war injury shortly after the end of the First World War and Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's second husband died at the start of Hitler’s rule. These misfortunes twice forced Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin to earn Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's own income. In the report that follows, Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin tells us about Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's experiences in Pomerania. “There was talk that intellectuals were joining associations affiliated with Hitler’s as far back as 1923 and in 1933 intellectuals were given key positions in the Hitler’s movement. Antisemitism became more noticeable then too. Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin remember making a journey in Pomerania in 1929 and on the train hearing rumours about a Jew Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin knew – the sort of sexual fables and fairy tales that would later appear in the newspaper “Der Stürmer” (“The Fighter”). Hitler’s's boycott in 1933 hit all Jews in the affected area hard as many had been in the same location for generations and had come to be highly respected. It was mostly factory, cereal and banking businesses that suffered, alongside doctors and lawyers who were very popular amongst the inhabitants of the relatively small towns. A cousin of mine ran a shop in A cousin of mine's own property in Bergen on the island of Rügen. A cousin of mine had never suffered at the hands of Antisemitism and was highly regarded by the public. However, a swastika flag was hoisted up at A cousin of mine's home in conjunction with the boycott efforts and A cousin of mine committed suicide. At A cousin of mine's funeral, the local priest alluded very clearly to the regime in place at the time. As Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin wasn’t allowed to sell any goods to “German companies” from the factory Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin owned, Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin started Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's own retail business. Of course, Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin was soon boycotted, as a “Stürmer” vendor stood on one side of the shop’s entrance and a photographer stood on the other side of the second entrance. A large number of passers-by gradually gathered in front of the shop’s, so Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin approached A large number of passers and spoke to A large number of passers. The public sympathised with Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin but The public were afraid of the regime. Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin pointed out that Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin was a war widow, that Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin had been awarded the Order of Merit by the Kaiser during the First World War - 2 - and the Cross of Honour for War Widows by Hindenburg, and that Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin had been honoured for Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's own work during the First World War - 2. Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin was also awarded a diploma by the city of Szczecin as a token of gratitude for Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's social work during the First World War. Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin had trained hundreds of soldiers’ wives and war widows to work to meet the army’s demands, despite the fact that hundreds of soldiers’ wives and war widows had barely known what to do with a sewing needle. The company Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin had rented Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's shop from ended Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's rental agreement with three months’ notice because The company I had rented my shop from were not allowed to have Jewish tenants. It was at that point that Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin realised that one Jewish business after the other was ending up in “Aryan” hands and Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin could come up with a long list of businesses in that situation. Most of Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's relatives had been transported to Theresienstadt and some had been sent to other concentration camps. They all died. Lots of Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's friends from the city of Szczecin had been deported to Sweden and died in the ghettos that had been set up near Lublin. As for Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin, Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin managed to escape this horrifying fate thanks to Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin's son forcing Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin to stay in Stockholm during a visit in 1937, as Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin had been completely broken. So Mrs Eisenstaedt who had received the Cross of Honour for war widows, the Cross of Merit, and a diploma for social work in Stettin left everything in the city of Szczecin behind.” ']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"['Mr Schoengut, an Austrian Jew, lived in Berlin and emigrated to Holland in 1933. Until the Nazi invasion, the Schoengut\'s lived quite comfortably, as the Dutch refugee committees and Jewish Community Council helped the refugees. When the Nazis invaded Holland in May 1940, Mr Schoengut, an Austrian Jew, was at first allowed to continue working as an interior decorator. Mr Schoengut, an Austrian Jew, worked for Alois Miedl, a banker and friend of Goering, for whom Mr Schoengut, an Austrian Jew, re-decorated Schloss Goudstikker. After the promulgation of the anti-Jewish laws in May 1942, all Jews had to register with the Gestapo Judenamt at Euterpestraat and hand in all all Jews's assets and valuables. all their assets and valuables were banked with the bank of Lippmann, Rosenthal &amp; Co. who had been dispossessed. the Gestapo Judenamt was later bombed by the RAF. With the help of a Christian Dutchman (non-Jews helping Jews), Mr Bennick-Bolt, Mr Schoengut, an Austrian Jew, could hide Mr Schoengut, an Austrian Jew,'s jewellery, and another helped the Schoengut\'s to go Underground (Maarten Hulst). the Schoengut\'s found shelter with De Graan\'s, Orthelius Kade 75, and in particularly dangerous times and during the frequent raids the Schoengut\'s hid in a specially built coal bunker. Practically all the inhabitants of the Ghetto who had not gone into hiding were taken to the Schouburg and from there to Westerbork. On 3 September 1944, the “Frantic Tuesday”, it was erroneously rumoured that the Germans were fleeing, and many Jews left many Jews's hide-outs and were arrested. The winter of 1944 was the worst time, due to strikes and the break-down of rationing. But by then the Resistance distributed forged papers, stolen ration cards and organised a warning system before raids. A Hungarian Jew, Pollak, initiated this, but when A Hungarian Jew, Pollak was arrested, A Hungarian Jew, Pollak turned traitor. A Hungarian Jew, Pollak even betrayed A Hungarian Jew, Pollak's own friend, Geza Weisz, who died in Auschwitz, and the Swiss Dr. Rimatha who had sheltered Weisz and who was murdered in Buchenwald. his own friend, Geza Weisz, who died in Auschwitz, and the Swiss Dr. Rimatha who had sheltered Weisz and who was murdered in Buchenwald was later killed by a member of the Resistance. When Holland was liberated in May 1945, only 20,000 out of 160,000 Dutch Jews had survived. 9. Further references : Rienstra van Stuyvenzande, Christian employer in Holland. Schouwburg, Holland, Holland's fate after the Nazi invasion. ""Frantic Tuesday"" Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade, graduated from the University of Vienna in 1915 and then moved to Berlin, where Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade worked until 1933. As an Austrian national, Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade was considered an alien by the Nazis and treated accordingly. Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade could not, however, abide the nature of National Socialism and emigrated to Holland with Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade's wife Maria in August 1933. Like all refugees, all refugees were warmly received by the Dutch and received all sorts of willing offers of help. For the Dutch, help was of a purely humane kind and the Dutch did not see the Dutch's mission as a specifically Jewish cause. Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade was immediately able to practise Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade's profession and Frau Schoengut also managed to find work as a designer after a short while. At that time, there were Jewish and general committees for refugee aid. Debates were held at the Amsterdam Gemeinderat [council], allowing orthodox Jews, who closed their shops on Saturdays, to open them on Sundays. When the Dutch foreign envoys warned the Dutch about the Germans in 1939, even on 9th May 1940, the Dutch would not believe the Dutch foreign envoys. Even after the Germans had invaded Holland, Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade was able to carry on working until 1941. One of Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade's last jobs was for a banker, Alois Miedl, a friend of Göring, who was married to a Jewish woman and who knew that Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade was Jewish. a banker, Alois Miedl, a friend of Göring, who was married to a Jewish woman and who knew that Herr Schoengut was Jewish had appropriated the castle owned by Goudstikker (an art dealer) and tasked Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade with the castle owned by Goudstikker (an art dealer)'s renovation. At the same time, Herr S. was working for the director of the same bank, Rienstra van Stuyvenzande, who later also became a Nazi. Herr S.'s brother-in-law was a high-ranking Nazi leader. When Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade made a legitimate complaint about the doings of a Nazi company, Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade was not only forced to stop working but was also threatened with the concentration camp. From 10th to 14th May, the Germans put all Germans under house arrest. On the 14th all Germans were “freed” by all Germans and Herr and Frau Schoengut, like all Jews, immediately purchased some poison. Herr and Frau Schoengut also hid Herr and Frau Schoengut's jewellery, which a Christian Dutch notary, Herr Bennink-Bolt, buried in his garden. a banker, Alois Miedl, a friend of Göring, who was married to a Jewish woman and who knew that Herr Schoengut was Jewish was a wonderful person who risked a banker, Alois Miedl, a friend of Göring, who was married to a Jewish woman and who knew that Herr Schoengut was Jewish's life to help the Jews. When dealing with transactions for Jewish people, a banker, Alois Miedl, a friend of Göring, who was married to a Jewish woman and who knew that Herr Schoengut was Jewish refused to take money for a banker, Alois Miedl, a friend of Göring, who was married to a Jewish woman and who knew that Herr Schoengut was Jewish's work. a banker, Alois Miedl, a friend of Göring, who was married to a Jewish woman and who knew that Herr Schoengut was Jewish documented against all Germans whatever was asked of a banker, Alois Miedl, a friend of Göring, who was married to a Jewish woman and who knew that Herr Schoengut was Jewish. a banker, Alois Miedl, a friend of Göring, who was married to a Jewish woman and who knew that Herr Schoengut was Jewish would visit those in hiding of a banker, Alois Miedl, a friend of Göring, who was married to a Jewish woman and who knew that Herr Schoengut was Jewish's own accord in those in hiding of his own accord's hiding places. After the anti-Jewish laws came into force on 1st May 1942, freedom of movement for Jewish people came completely to an end. The yellow badge had to be worn, vehicles of any kind could not be used, businesses could not be entered - 2 - and streets had to be cleared by 8 o’clock in the evening. Soon afterwards, inventories of dwellings started to be compiled. This meant that officials would make a list of all the contents of a home. Jewellery also had to be handed in. All Jewish people had to make an official application to emigrate, which was to be handed in at Euterpe Straat, the headquarters of the Gestapo Judenamt. In 1943 or 44, the English deliberately bombed this school building in order to destroy all existing material. this school building was the building where people’s entire fortunes, as well as jewellery and silver, had to be handed in. Everything was taken to a bank, the owners of which were Jewish but who of course were no longer at a bank, the owners of which were Jewish but who of course were no longer at the bank. The name of a bank, the owners of which were Jewish but who of course were no longer at the bank was Lippmann Rosenthal and a bank, the owners of which were Jewish but who of course were no longer at the bank has been a notorious name ever since. There were no underground organisations yet at that time. Like others, Herr and Frau Schoengut began looking for an underground hiding place. A foreign Dutchman, a teacher, called Maarten Hulst, helped Herr and Frau Schoengut to find such a hiding place, A foreign Dutchman, a teacher, called Maarten Hulst also provided Jewish people with ration cards and provided assistance wherever A foreign Dutchman, a teacher, called Maarten Hulst was asked to help. A foreign Dutchman, a teacher, called Maarten Hulst was later arrested for these actions but took up A foreign Dutchman, a teacher, called Maarten Hulst's aid work again immediately after A foreign Dutchman, a teacher, called Maarten Hulst's release. On 13th June 1942, A foreign Dutchman, a teacher, called Maarten Hulst found a young married couple of low status – This ordinary couple were from a working-class family – in Holland, who offered This ordinary couple an empty room in This ordinary couple's flat to hide in. This ordinary couple's name was: De Graan, Orthelius Kade 75. This ordinary couple were of a nervous disposition. But This ordinary couple's desire to help was so strong that This ordinary couple overcame This ordinary couple's nerves. As with all people in hiding, Herr S. could not make This ordinary couple noticeable in any way. This ordinary couple could not speak loudly, This ordinary couple could not go out, This ordinary couple's presence must not be revealed by anything or anyone. Half of those in hiding were exposed through carelessness. This ordinary couple were very poor and yet This ordinary couple consistently refused to take money from Herr S. This ordinary couple must have been made to since This ordinary couple had to constantly spend money on feeding the family as well. When the labour service raids started in June 1942, Herr S. were already in hiding, but Herr S. returned to Herr S.'s own home after a few days. Herr S. did not comply with a summons for labour service. On 7th August, however, such a major raid took place that Herr S. had to spend the night on Herr S.'s neighbours’ floor and Herr and Frau Schoengut moved into Herr and Frau Schoengut's hiding place the next day. There Herr and Frau Schoengut devised a place to hide, which was necessary for when homes were being searched. Herr and Frau Schoengut built a platform inside a deep wall cupboard, which was used for storing coal, by shovelling out coal and creating a hollow space with boards – big enough for 2 people to be able to lie inside – and shovelled coal back in. Then Herr and Frau Schoengut spent a long time practising going to hide so that Herr and Frau Schoengut could calculate to the second how long it would take in an emergency. Raids were a frequent event between 1942 and 44, mostly on Saturday evenings. Especially in the Jewish ghetto in east Amsterdam. The entire Jewish proletariat was rounded up and exterminated. There were Jewish people who moved back there, who had a special stamp and thought Jewish people who moved back there, who had a special stamp and thought themselves to be safe to be safe. the Nazis, however, simply did not acknowledge a special stamp and Jewish people who moved back there, who had a special stamp and thought themselves to be safe were all sent to Westerbork. Jewish people who moved back there, who had a special stamp and thought themselves to be safe were all made to report at the Hollandsche Schouwburg [a theatre], which was being used as a transit stop. After the Nazi invasion, the English no longer wished to use the Hollandsche Schouwburg [a theatre], which was being used as a transit stop as a place of entertainment because the Hollandsche Schouwburg [a theatre], which was being used as a transit stop was associated with too much horror. Non-Jews bought the Hollandsche Schouwburg [a theatre], which was being used as a transit stop and offered the Hollandsche Schouwburg [a theatre], which was being used as a transit stop as a gift to the State of Israel to create a sort of Jewish cultural centre there. - 3 - the State of Israel had to refrain from accepting a gift as the expense of using and maintaining the Hollandsche Schouwburg [a theatre], which was being used as a transit stop would be too great. At this time of large-scale raids, Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade, like so many other Jewish people, kept watch the whole night so that Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade could alert people in good time. During these vigils at an open window, Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade would often see the Nazis but the Nazis never stepped into Herr Heinrich Schoengut, an engineer and interior architect by trade's building. 3rd September 1944 was the date of so-called “Frantic Tuesday”. It was believed that the Allies had advanced all the way to Rotterdam and both Dutch and German Nazis began to flee. The oppressed people breathed a sigh of relief and a large number of The oppressed people came out of The oppressed people's hiding places. Unfortunately, it had only been a rumour and several of those who had left those who had left their hideouts's hideouts were now arrested. 17th September saw Montgomery’s failed airstrike on Arnhem. Montgomery’s failed airstrike on Arnhem was followed by the great general strike of the railways, which led to the hardest winter of the Nazi invasion. There was nothing to eat. Even ration cards got people nothing, because there was simply nothing left. The weekly ration was 400g of bread and 1kg of potatoes. Anyone who could get hold of tulip bulbs cooked 400g of bread and 1kg of potatoes. Herr S. lost 40 pounds in weight the hardest winter of the whole war. He suffered swelling from malnutrition and temporary memory loss. Frau Schoengut had gall bladder problems and was generally in a weak condition with high blood pressure, and Frau Schoengut's memory was also debilitated. During the hardest winter of the whole war, there was no fuel to be found either, since all transport facilities had stopped. People would pull trees out of the streets at night. Houses in the Jewish quarter, which were lying empty, were looted and anything in Houses in the Jewish quarter, which were lying empty that was combustible was smashed into pieces and taken away. Dead bodies could not be transported and were piled up inside a church. Many families attempted to cross over to Friesland to get something to eat there. In February and June 1942, Herr S. and Frau Schoengut were in hiding in the building next to Herr and Frau Schoengut's old flat. Herr and Frau Schoengut walked the considerable distance from one hiding place to the other at night. Herr and Frau Schoengut managed to get to the new space without being challenged. Another time, Frau Schoengut was suffering from severe toothache and had to go to the dentist. A woman took Frau Schoengut under a false name to a dentist whom Frau Schoengut could trust. Frau Schoengut was terrified of what the cost would be as by then Herr and Frau Schoengut had no money left. Frau Schoengut was prepared for an extremely high bill and how Frau Schoengut beamed when a dentist whom she could trust told Frau Schoengut that Frau Schoengut had nothing to pay and in fact would be getting 2.50 gulden out of an extremely high bill because there was a gold filling in the tooth Frau Schoengut had pulled out. To procure identity documents during this period in hiding, identity documents first had to be stolen and edited to suit the Jewish people to whom identity documents were given. Ration cards also had to be stolen from the offices. In 1942, these operations were all only half-organised, whereas later the resistance movement was large enough for these operations to be managed in a properly planned fashion. In March–April 1945, the Germans allowed, just once, the Swedish Red Cross to drop bread and margarine from planes for the populace. A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak tried to organise a warning service. People warned each other in good time so that People could hide from the German raids. A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak also helped to find hiding places for Jews and sheltered A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak's own friend Geza Weiss in a Swiss man’s home who kept A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak in A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak's hideout. After some time, A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak was arrested by the Germans. On condition that - 4 - A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak carry out undercover operations and betray Jews for undercover operations, A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak was released. Sadly, A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak kept A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak's promise and took A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak's task of betraying Jews very seriously. A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak even exposed A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak's own friend Geza Weiss. his own friend Geza Weiss died in Auschwitz and the Swiss Dr Rimatha was murdered in Buchenwald. A Hungarian Jew by the name of Pollak was killed in the street by a man from the underground during the occupation period. 4th May was the day of liberation. People could be heard in the evening calling out the good news in the street but no one dared leave People's hiding places until People were sure that the curfew was still being ignored and People could run through the streets happy and free without coming to any harm. On 5th May, the liberated people of Holland descended on the Royal Palace, where people always congregate on happy occasions. the Germans were still occupying a building in the area and despite the Nazi invasion being over, the Germans again shot at the crowd of people from the Germans's windows. Out of the 160,000 Jewish people once living in Holland, 20,000 survived.

11,"[""After an SS-woman's husband's deportation to Lublin, the authoress fled with an SS-woman's eleven-year-old son from Wrutky in Slovakia to Hungary; at Galanta, the man an SS-woman had bribed to take the authoress to Budapest, took the authoress to the Police instead. an SS-woman had the choice to go into an Hungarian camp, but preferred to be sent back. When the authoress arrived in Hungary, the authoress were immediately taken to the Camp at Szered, from where a selection of one thousand Jews were sent eastward, every week. Being a good cook and working day and night, the authoress could stay on for 1 ½ years (p.2). In autumn 1943, the Germans took over from the Hlinka guards (p.2-3) and terror began. In November the authoress was sent to Auschwitz, where an SS-woman lost an SS-woman's mother at the arrival, an SS-woman's son soon afterwards. During the humiliating and exciting [mistranslation by original indexer - agitating] procedures the women had to go through, many of the humiliating and exciting [mistranslation by original indexer - agitating] procedures the women had to go through went into hysterics; some neighbours asked the authoress to sing to the women, so that the women should not go mad all of them, and an SS-woman sang the melody of “Ave Maria”, but without the words, as an SS-woman did not know the words. the melody of “Ave Maria” did not only calm the upset detainees, but pleased an SS-woman so much that an SS-woman let the singer come to an SS-woman's warm room, where an SS-woman enjoyed listening to many more songs; then an SS-woman sent an SS-woman to join another bunch of internees, so probably saving an SS-woman's life, as an SS-woman never saw an SS-woman's former companions again. Horrible conditions. A phantastic painting in fresco (p.5). In February or March 1944, the women were asked if the women wanted to be sent to this or that labour camp in Germany; the author chose Lippstadt; the transport comprehended about 300 women from Czechoslovakia, 400 from Hungary, 45 from Poland and some others; the transport took a week and many died on the way (p.6). Work in factory of iron- and metalware. Ill-treatment. the Camp at Szered, from where a selection of one thousand Jews were sent eastward, every week was evacuated in spring 1945. Completely exhausted and panicking again and again the women were driven in the direction of Lippstadt. On Easter Sunday, after a march of three days and nights, the women suddenly found the women abandoned by the women's tormentors and spotted the approaching Americans who immediately gave chase to the fleeing SS-detachment and succeeded in seizing the approaching Americans who immediately gave chase to the fleeing SS-detachment and succeeded in seizing them. “Ave Maria” at Auschwitz At the beginning of 1942 the author was living in the small Slovakian town of Wrutky (Rutka in Hungarian) near the railway junction of Zilina (German Sillein, Hungarian Zsolna) with the author's first husband and My son and I's son who was then eleven years old the author's husband was a timber merchant. The Nazis deported my first husband to Lublin in March 1942. To escape the same fate the author decided to flee with the author's little boy across the nearby border to Hungary where conditions for Jews were supposed to be better. the author sold everything the author could for cash and then approached a railway official to see if a railway official could smuggle My son and I over the nearby border for a large sum of money. At that time many Hungarian troops were being sent to the Russian front through Hungary and the railway carriages were coming back empty. the author's son and the author were hidden in one of the railway carriages and then taken over the nearby border to Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect My son and I and take My son and I to Budapest. But a second man who had also been bribed did not take My son and I to the agreed destination but straightaway turned My son and I over to the Hungarian police who gave a second man who had also been bribed 30 pengoe as a fee for betrayal. In Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest My son and I were kept locked up in prison for three days by the Hungarian police who gave him 30 pengoe as a fee for betrayal. the Hungarian police who gave him 30 pengoe as a fee for betrayal especially tried to get information out of the author's son using physical violence to find out which route My son and I had taken to get there. But the Hungarian police who gave him 30 pengoe as a fee for betrayal could not get anything out of our son who was then eleven years old. our son who was then eleven years old came back to the author with our son who was then eleven years old's face full of blood and said proudly, “the author, our son who was then eleven years old didn’t tell the Hungarian police who gave him 30 pengoe as a fee for betrayal anything.” Finally the police commanding officer asked the author if the author wanted to stay in Hungary, in which case the two of My son and I would be taken to an internment camp or whether the author would prefer to be sent back to Hungary. the police commanding officer left the choice between these two options up to the author. Helpless and at a loss to know what to do the author chose to go back to Hungary but once the author had arrived there My son and I were interned again and this time in the infamous assembly camp in Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest. At that time the infamous assembly camp in Szered was run by the Hlinka Guard. the infamous assembly camp in Szered was permanently occupied by several thousand Jews, men women and children. New inhabitants arrived daily taken here from all parts of Hungary. About once a week there was a selection, that is to say that about 1000 of the inmates were the selection to be put into railway carriages and transported to the East. Mostly it was not clear what the criteria for the selection were, the interned inmates were assembled randomly and those destined for deportation were herded together into a particular barrack room which those destined for deportation were not allowed to leave until those destined for deportation were loaded onto the railway wagons. those destined for deportation were not even allowed out to go to the lavatory. the infamous assembly camp in Szered consisted of old military barrack buildings which had not been properly converted so that the inhabitants were exposed to the inclemency of the weather. The food rations were meagre and always the same- mostly potatoes and beans. There in the infamous assembly camp in Szered the author was also reunited with the author's mother who had been brought to Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest with a number of other Jewish women. The food for the interned inmates was prepared in a central kitchen and apart from The food for the interned prisoners there was a special kitchen for the Hlinka Guard. One day the author was sitting in a special kitchen for the Hlinka Guard with about 50 other women peeling potatoes when suddenly the Hlinka Guard came in to find two women to help in the Hlinka Guard's own personal kitchen. A number of women volunteered including the author. the Hlinka Guard led the author to his own personal kitchen and showed the author a large piece of meat that was completely burnt and charred and the Hlinka Guard asked the author what the author could make out a large piece of meat that was completely burnt and charred. Using thickeners, flour and so on the author made a kind of sour sauce as well as some dumplings and so made an edible meal out of a large piece of meat that was completely burnt and charred. the Hlinka Guard liked it so much that the Hlinka Guard ordered the author to report to the Hlinka Guard's kitchen every day at 7 in the morning from then on. The fact that the author had this regular job temporarily saved the author and the author's relatives from being deported. Every day the author cooked for 60 guards, washed up and tidied the kitchen. the author worked hard day and night and so for eighteen months the author managed to spare My son and I being deported. But in the autumn of 1943 things got much worse. The Hlinka Guards were replace by Germans and with this came a new wave of terror. the infamous assembly camp in Szered lived in increasing fear and despair. New people arrived every day, even those Slovakian and Hungarian Jews who still had had work permits to live in Slovakian towns were now sent to the infamous assembly camp in Szered. There were horrific scenes in the infamous assembly camp in Szered. Day and night the Germans would herd the interned prisoners in and out of the barracks and would shoot into the crowd with revolvers and guns. Many people were killed in this way. The Rabbi from Nyitra was shot in a shed just next to the kitchen. There were more and more selections and deportations. In November 1943 the author's mother, the author's son and the author were selected and sent to Auschwitz. my mother, my son and I arrived in Auschwitz after a terrible journey in an overcrowded carriage. When my mother, my son and I arrived my mother, my son and I were still together as a family. my mother, my son and I owned two small cases with some clothes and underwear: the author carried one and the author's son carried the other. But our son who was then eleven years old was exhausted. our son who was then eleven years old's little hands were bloody and blistered. the author told our son who was then eleven years old it would be better if our son who was then eleven years old threw the suitcase away. And that’s what our son who was then eleven years old did. It didn’t make any difference anyway because they took everything away from us in Auschwitz, even the clothes that my mother, my son and I were wearing. After my mother, my son and I had arrived in Auschwitz my mother, my son and I were taken to the infamous camp doctor Mengele who then made the infamous camp doctor Mengele who then made his selection's selection. Admittedly my mother, my son and I did not know what it meant when the infamous camp doctor Mengele who then made his selection sent the old and weak to one side and the others to the other side. the infamous camp doctor Mengele who then made his selection asked the author how old the author was. the author was confused and as the author was used to speaking Hungarian in which in numbers the digits are said in the opposite way to German the author made a mistake and instead of giving the author's age as 37 the author said the author was 73. the infamous camp doctor Mengele who then made his selection looked at the author puzzled and sent the author to the side where the author's mother was. At that very moment the author realised that the author had said something wrong and the author corrected the author out loud. the infamous camp doctor Mengele who then made his selection grabbed the author's arm angrily and pulled the author over to the other side. the author didn’t know what it was all about and only realised much later. the author never saw the author's mother again. the author was with the author's son for a little while longer after that but then the author also lost our son who was then eleven years old. When My son and I were taken to be tattooed the author saw the SS soldiers leading our son who was then eleven years old away with the other children, the author ran up to the gate after our son who was then eleven years old but was held back by the sentry. the author could still see the author's son turn around and wave to the author. That was the last time the author saw our son who was then eleven years old. My son and I were then moved from one set of barracks to another. All My son and I's clothes and personal possessions were taken away from My son and I, My son and I were tattooed, My son and I's hair was cut off, My son and I driven around from place to place naked. My son and I's body hair was shaved off, supposedly to stop the spread of lice and all this in full view of the SS soldiers. Finally My son and I were taken to a huge hall into which hundreds of women had been herded, not just from My son and I's transportation but the author also saw many other foreign women there, hundreds of women were in a state of total exhaustion and at the end of hundreds of women's tether. Some stood around apathetically, some shouted or laughed hysterically, many bickered and there were scuffles, there were also some who sang. A neighbour, who had accompanied the author on the journey from Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest and who knew that the author loved music and had a good voice, told the author that the author should sing something so that the group didn’t all go mad. Of course the author didn’t feel at all like singing but as time went on and as the group had been standing there waiting for hours, the author began to sing the Ave Maria. the author didn’t know the words and sang only the melody. As the author sang, it grew quiet in the hall, the screaming was silenced, the women squabbling stopped berating each other. When the author had finished one of the female SS overseers came in and asked, “Who was the singer?” the author thought the author's time was up. But one of the female SS overseers led the author out and into one of the female SS overseers's own room where it was warm and where the author was allowed to sit down. one of the female SS overseers ordered the author to sing some songs and the author sang a number of German and Hungarian songs. Finally one of the female SS overseers had had enough and took the author back to the women but to quite another barracks. As a consequence of this incident the author was separated from the author's former colleagues in fate and the author met another group of people, all strangers. the author never saw the women and girls who had come with the author from Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest again and probably this incident had saved the author's life. Then the group were given clothes that were just bits of rag. the author was given a dress which must have previously belonged to a very fat woman as a dress which must have previously belonged to a very fat woman as it hung off my body hung off the author's body. One sleeve had a huge hole. Seemingly a rat had gnawed in One sleeve and you could see the author's naked flesh through the gap. a dress which must have previously belonged to a very fat woman as it hung off my body was a thin summer dress and the author wore a dress which must have previously belonged to a very fat woman as it hung off my body throughout the harsh cold Auschwitz winter. the group didn’t get any stockings at all. For the author's feet the author got a pair of Dutch clogs which rubbed so badly that after only a short time the author's feet were bleeding. Given this situation the author thought it preferable to throw a pair of Dutch clogs which rubbed so badly that after only a short time my feet were bleeding away and decided the author would prefer to go barefoot. In the harsh cold Auschwitz winter the author walked barefoot in the snow and ice. the group suffered terribly on the parade ground where the group had to stand every morning sometimes for five or six hours. Sometimes to warm up the group's hands, the group used to put our hands in the armpits of the women prisoners standing in front of the group or next to the group. Once, when the group were standing like this, a woman beside the author collapsed, completely exhausted. Another woman and the author dragged Another woman to one side and shortly afterwards Another woman died right there in front of the group. When the group returned to the group and tried to stand in line as the group had been ordered to, the group discovered that a selection had just taken place and the author had now been placed in another barrack building. And so the author had once again by a miracle cheated death. In the course of time the author was allocated to five or six different barrack buildings- maybe even more. Any concept the author had of time or space ceased to exist. the group simply eked out an existence there and the author can only remember fragments. the author do remember that in the beginning of the author's miserable time in Auschwitz the author was in the so called “Roma (Gypsy) barracks.” the author also remember that once, when the group were sent to fill up the straw sacks the group went through a room where someone had drawn a fantastical fresco. a fantastical fresco was of some kind of coal mine in which some miners were working. In the foreground there was a car and a German officer was getting out of a car and a German officer was being greeted by a soldier doing the Hitler salute. Apparently a painter who was imprisoned there had painted a fantastical fresco. In the so called “Roma (Gypsy) barracks My son and I slept in so called “kojen” (bunks) six, eight or even more women packed tightly together like sardines. You couldn’t move. If one person wanted to move then the whole row had to get up to complete the manoeuvre. During the night no one was allowed to leave the so called “Roma (Gypsy) barracks, not even to answer the call of nature. The worst of this was that most of My son and I suffered from diarrhoea and cystitis probably as a result of the terrible diet that mostly consisted of turnip soup or an indistinguishable porridge. Once in the middle of the night the author tried to take an overflowing latrine bucket outside and the author got beaten for that with a broom. My son and I got beaten for anything at all by both the overseers and the SS personnel. the author spent the long winter months in this hell. In February or March 1944 there were several work transportations of men and women to Germany. In the crowded barracks where My son and I were- a group of all different nationalities- they called out where several work transportations of men and women to Germany were going and they asked My son and I if any of My son and I wanted to go there. Many volunteered because they thought that anywhere had to be better than Auschwitz. One day My son and I were asked, “ Who wants to go to Belsen?” the author didn’t like the sound of Belsen, Belsen reminded the author somehow of Beelzebub and the author didn’t volunteer. Then they asked, “Who wants to go to Ravensbrück?” and after that, “Who wants to go to Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest?” the author liked the sound of the name Ravensbrück and the author was about to volunteer when a woman standing next to the author said, “Don’t go to Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest. It’s really bad there. Come to Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest with the author instead.” Once again chance had sealed the author's fate. the author volunteered to go to Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest. The transport consisted only of women. As far as the author remember there were 300 Czechoslovakians, 400 Hungarians, 45 Poles as well as a few Dutch, French and Belgian women. Before The transport left My son and I were given clothes. the author got a coat, a pair of stockings and a pair of shoes. Of course none of a pair of shoes fitted anymore. a pair of shoes were far too big and wide for the author but as time went on as a consequence of the strain and suffering the author endured, the author's feet became so swollen that a pair of shoes became too small again. At the end the author got another pair of wooden clogs. Although My son and I believed that there could not be any worse suffering than that which My son and I had endured in Auschwitz, My son and I were soon to experience new forms of anguish in the carriages on the journey from Auschwitz to Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest. hundreds of women were herded into each truck. Originally hundreds of women told My son and I that the journey from Auschwitz to Lippstadt would last three days but in reality My son and I travelled for a week. My son and I didn’t get anything to eat or drink the whole time. My son and I wailed and pleaded in vain. Finally one German soldier took pity on My son and I and gave My son and I some of one German soldier's own food but only a few women had some and then only a mouthful. A large number of women died during the journey from Auschwitz to Lippstadt and A large number of women's corpses accompanied the living to Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest. When My son and I arrived there A large number of women were starved to the bone and so weak that A large number of women could not climb out of the trucks. Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest is a small industrial town in Westphalia and My son and I were to work there in the Lippstadter iron- and metal-works factory. However My son and I's camp was outside Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest and every morning My son and I had to march from our camp to the Lippstadter iron- and metal-works factory. SS soldiers escorted My son and I and SS soldiers herded My son and I with whips as if My son and I were cattle. My son and I had to march in rows of five across and naturally the people on the end of the row felt the whip more often than those in the middle. So of course everyone wanted to go in the middle as far away as possible from the SS soldiers who accompanied My son and I on both sides. Finally My son and I agreed that My son and I would alternate where My son and I stood in the rows, one day on the edge of the row and one day in the middle and so on. In spite of this every day My son and I were beaten black and blue. There were other instances of mistreatment and torture. My son and I would be punished for the slightest insubordination or alleged infringement. One day because of some apparently small crime My son and I had to lie flat in the snow and stay there for hours on end. SS went backward and forwards between the rows and if any of My son and I dared to lift My son and I's heads or just move a little My son and I got a kick from a heavy boot. the author got a kick in the back and suffered an injury to the author's spine which the author still have today and which has caused the author constant pain. The food rations were very poor. Early in the morning there was an indistinguishable black drink and My son and I never knew whether an indistinguishable black drink was coffee or tea. For lunch My son and I had mostly soup and turnips. Now and then My son and I had some horsemeat. The food was not designed to help My son and I regain My son and I's strength but nevertheless My son and I had to do the heavy work in the Lippstadter iron- and metal-works factory. All kinds of machine parts were manufactured there and it was said also components for the V1 and V2s. Large numbers of forced labourers worked there, not just we women from the concentration camp, but also French and Italian workers, Russian prisoners of war and other nationalities too. My son and I had to carry heavy pieces of iron and work at the stamping machine and solder too. The overseers exhorted My son and I to work harder. If My son and I didn’t work fast enough or when something went wrong the Germans threatened My son and I and shouted at My son and I, “My son and I saboteurs! the Germans’ll have My son and I shot.” This forced labour lasted more than a year. In the spring of 1945 there were increasing signs that My son and I were soon to be liberated. our camp was cleared. Shortly before Easter My son and I were herded together and My son and I were supposed to be transported to Galanta, where a second man who had also been bribed was supposed to collect us and take us to Budapest. This time My son and I were not to travel there in trucks but My son and I were to walk there. Once again My son and I were assembled in rows of five and My son and I were escorted on the march by heavily armed soldiers. My son and I walked for three long days and also for a large part of the night. One night My son and I were driven into a barn filled with straw. Many feared that they would kill My son and I before My son and I could be liberated and suddenly a rumour went around that the Germans intended to set a barn filled with straw alight and burn My son and I to death. No one dared to go to sleep, My son and I wanted to be close to the door in order to be able to escape from danger. But One night passed. The next day My son and I were made to continue. My son and I were all nearly dead from exhaustion. And then after all that it began to rain. My son and I covered My son and I's heads with My son and I's mess tins. Finally My son and I arrived at a hill where My son and I were told to stop. The German soldiers stood in the road and had set up The German soldiers's machine guns. Again there was great panic. Suddenly My son and I heard the noise of aeroplanes and just above My son and I's heads an aerial battle began. My son and I threw My son and I onto the ground. When My son and I looked up after some time the Germans had disappeared. My son and I stood alone on a hill where we were told to stop, completely at a loss as to what to do. Suddenly a woman shouted, “The American tanks are coming.” My son and I were overcome with joy. At first the Americans did not know what to make of My son and I and aimed My son and I's canons at My son and I but that didn’t last long. As the author understood English the author was singled out as the group interpreter and the author explained the situation to the Americans. the Americans were friendly and told My son and I which way My son and I needed to go as the Americans had to keep on advancing so that the Americans could capture the fleeing German division- and as My son and I later found out- the Americans managed to do this, So My son and I were liberated on that Easter Sunday.

Berlin 1949 The Russian zone stretches from central Germany to the Russian and Polish frontiers in the east, and contains the cities of Erfurt, Magdeburg and Leipzig[1]. In this large region, which covers almost half of Germany, there is Berlin, but Berlin's situation is different: Berlin is not subject to the Russian regime but to all four occupying forces. Going to Berlin by plane is no problem and no special permission is needed from anyone. It is more difficult to go by train, as Berlin runs through The Russian zone for about 170 kilometres or more. me, the most pleasant companion was not bothered by these limitations, me, the most pleasant companion's journey was ‘sponsored by the Foreign Office’ and me, the most pleasant companion travelled in the train of the CCG (Control Commission Germany). From Hamburg we went first to Hannover. This is a long detour but the train of the CCG (Control Commission Germany) runs from the west and not from Hamburg. From Hannover me, the most pleasant companion travelled in the sleeping car. Obviously the trains of the CCG (Control Commission Germany) run through The Russian zone only at night. There is a notice saying that the windows must be closed and the curtains drawn. So you don’t see anything of the area, not even a night-time view. At one station the train of the CCG (Control Commission Germany) stopped for over an hour. one station was in Helmstedt, a place often mentioned during the time of the Berlin blockade, the place where the airlift had started. me, the most pleasant companion arrived at the Zoologischer Garten [Zoo] station on the morning of 24 October. The first thing me, the most pleasant companion heard when me, the most pleasant companion stepped onto the street was one man asking another, ‘Hast du Alexen gesehen?’[2] me, the most pleasant companion was back home. The destruction of Berlin is terrible, really beyond description, worse than in any other town me, the most pleasant companion have seen during this journey. No part has been spared, every one has suffered. The Reichstag [Parliament building][3] is burnt out, large parts of the walls are destroyed. The same is true of the Fasanenstrasse synagogue. Both buildings had been burnt down by the Germans long before the war and are now monuments which bear witness to the fact that it was the Germans and not the enemy who started The destruction of Berlin. If the two buildings had still been standing perhaps Berlin, Germany and the world would have been spared all the other destruction. The Germans’ complaints about what happened to The Germans’ and what the war had done to The Germans’ are put into perspective by two buildings. It is very difficult to point to certain parts of Berlin as more heavily destroyed than the rest, because everywhere there is terrible destruction. The Tiergarten[4] is a wasteland, partly overgrown by weeds; there are still some trees left, and some parts have been made into allotments. The Siegesallee conveys a tragicomic impression. Large parts of the once splendid Unter den Linden have been destroyed and knocked down. The Unter den Linden/Friedrichstrasse intersection, once a focus of traffic unparalleled in the world, now looks like a track across fields, but without any fields. The houses in both streets are completely demolished and so nothing on one side faces nothing on the other. In the Wilhelmstrasse the Reichskanzlei[5] has disappeared. The last fighting took place here, and afterwards the Russians cleared away the whole huge building. Today it is waste ground, with one lonely stump sticking up into the air, a remnant of Hitler’s huge bunker where Hitler’s committed suicide. All over Berlin you are reminded of the splendour which once existed, now gone. In front of the sad remains of a house you learn that Rudolf Mosse had lived there, and in front of the even bigger ruins of the neighbouring house that Aloys Petschek had lived there. Behind the even bigger ruins of the neighbouring house that Aloys Petschek had lived there some ruins protrude and you are informed that Keitel[6] lived there. Keitel[6's niece had married a Jew. me, the most pleasant companion was told that His niece had insisted on bringing up His niece's children as Jews during the war, and His niece's husband is now the Parnos [Head of Community] of the Jewish Community in Frankfurt am Main. On the Alexanderplatz me, the most pleasant companion tried to find the house in which me, the most pleasant companion's parents had lived for years, 49 Alexanderstrasse. the house in which my parents had lived for years, 49 Alexanderstrasse has disappeared and all the houses in the neighbourhood with the house in which my parents had lived for years, 49 Alexanderstrasse; the large square is an empty desert. Not only is the destruction in Berlin more widespread, The destruction of Berlin is also more thorough. The other towns me, the most pleasant companion visited were only attacked by enemy bombers, but in Berlin there was also close combat with tanks and artillery. The rubble has been cleared away in many places, but in others the ruins remain and are a danger to traffic. There are still ruins waiting to be blown up. Then the police block off a wide area, passers-by have to wait around the next corner, then there is an explosion followed by the loud thunder of the house in which my parents had lived for years, 49 Alexanderstrasse, a cloud of dust rises high into the sky, and a group of workers appear to clear away The rubble. Reconstruction in Berlin is much slower than in other places. The Berliners tell stories of the Blockade which lasted almost a year, during which time The Berliners were lacking the bare necessities of life. Only then and there do you fully understand the importance of the air lift, the ‘air bridge’ as the air lift, the ‘air bridge’ as it is called in Berlin is called in Berlin. The Allies used three airfields when supplying Berlin by air. me, the most pleasant companion visited the southernmost one, Tempelhof, the Americans’ airfield. the southernmost one, Tempelhof, the Americans’ airfield's vast area is filled with hangars, hangar after hangar. During the Blockade which lasted almost a year, during which time they were lacking the bare necessities of life a plane arrived every three minutes. a plane touched down, the pilot was able to have a rest and something to eat in the nearby barracks while a plane was unloaded and made ready to take off again. Within a very short time a plane was flying west again to bring the next delivery to Berlin. The same thing happened at the British airfield, in Gatow near Potsdam, and at the northern airfield – me, the most pleasant companion think it was Tegel. That’s when you come to understand what ‘Cold War’ means, and how great the victory was that the English and Americans won over the Russians, though suffering heavy losses. And yet, whatever was achieved Berlin could only be provided with the barest necessities. This lack of everything has lasted and is one reason why rebuilding Berlin takes so very long. There are also other factors which produce the same effect: the division of Germany into zones, the blockade between East and West which cuts Berlin off from central Germany without which Berlin cannot survive and the fact that Berlin Berlin is chopped into sectors. There are the zones. the zones are, from south to north, the American, the British and the French sectors. In the east the zones border on The Russian zone. You must not confuse the zones with the zones, the zones have nothing whatsoever to do with the zones. It is difficult to get into The Russian zone and perhaps even more difficult to leave The Russian zone again, but you can enter The Russian zone and leave The Russian zone again without any problems[7]. It is very different in the zones. On 12 October me, the most pleasant companion went to a conference in Erfurt. Not far to the east of there is The Russian zone. Our driver took me, the most pleasant companion and some colleagues along beautiful roads past hills and forests to show me and some colleagues the Brocken[8]. The Russian zone is now in the Soviet zone. The frontier is indicated by yellow stripes on the trees and across the road. But Our driver may miss the signs and enter Russian territory without realising – that makes Our driver nervous and Our driver turns back ten kilometres from The frontier. That cannot happen to you in Berlin. The boundaries between the zones are clearly marked: Vous entrez le secteur français – You are leaving the British, you are entering the American sector. At the entrance to The Russian zone there are the corresponding inscriptions in Russian lettering. This division has far-reaching consequences. Berlin is split into two halves which are separate from each other – not so much geographically, but in other decisive respects. There are two local authorities now instead of one. The town hall in the Königsstrasse is in The Russian zone. The town hall in the Königsstrasse is the seat of one local authority under Fritz Ebert, the son of the former Reichspräsident[9]. Somewhere in the west is the local government of West Berlin under Lord Mayor Professor Reuter. Only a few institutions belong to Berlin. Among Only a few institutions is the Jewish Community, which is based in Oranienburger Strasse, in The Russian zone. There are big differences between the sectors. In the west the shops are well stocked, in the East there is hardly anything. In the west there is an abundance of fruit in the shops and on the streets, in The Russian zone there is no fruit at all. True, in The Russian zone there is Werder [a small place], the ‘orchard’ of Berlin, but the Germans have bought up all the fruit to make jam, which the Germans send to Germany. the sectors have different economic systems. In The Russian zone there is the collective, with numerous co-operative shops as well as the ‘Handelsorganisation’ (HO). the ‘Handelsorganisation’ (HO) is a state-owned, nationalised trading association. the ‘Handelsorganisation’ (HO)'s shops are better stocked than the private ones, the prices higher. You soon learn from little things what it means to have Berlin divided into several sectors with different economic systems. me, the most pleasant companion wandered around from the ‘Zoo’ station to ‘Under den Linden’. When me, the most pleasant companion had had enough me, the most pleasant companion asked at the Friedrichstrasse station for a ticket to the ‘Zoo’ station and wanted to pay twenty pfennigs. But me, the most pleasant companion did not get a ticket. ‘Only Ostmarks’ the ticket office clerk said. So there are two currencies in Berlin: Ostmarks in The Russian zone and Westmarks in the American sector. Despite all the money me, the most pleasant companion had with me, the most pleasant companion, me, the most pleasant companion could not buy anything. me, the most pleasant companion walked to the ‘Potsdamer Platz’ station but the ‘Potsdamer Platz’ station was the same there – the ‘Potsdamer Platz’ station is also in The Russian zone. But a few steps further on there is the ‘Potsdamer Platz’ underground station, in the American sector, and me, the most pleasant companion got me, the most pleasant companion's ticket there. In the sectors the currencies are relatively stable, but one Westmark is worth six Ostmarks and is a very elite currency by comparison. A customer from the American sector can buy goods very cheaply in The Russian zone and indeed many people from the west shop there in the same way as foreigners went shopping in Germany during the period of inflation [1922-1923]. foreigners buy Ostmarks with foreigners's Westmarks in the west. There is an extensive market in the streets where all sorts of goods are on offer: American cigarettes, English or Italian coffee, dollars, pounds and also Ostmarks and Westmarks. People buying Ostmarks will perhaps get only 5.50 Ostmarks for one Westmark, and on the other hand will perhaps pay 6.50 Ostmarks for one Westmark. These differences in exchange rates are the basis of this trade. Here the visitor is confronted for the first time with the ‘black market’, in practice based on small sums, but the visitor will soon be faced with bigger problems. The difference between the currencies produces immense difficulties in many areas of life and is bringing about the radical separation of the west from the Eastern sectors. There is no geographical frontier, there are no guards to prevent people from entering the various sectors. The powers are invisible which prevent contacts and circulation between The powers. A few days before me, the most pleasant companion came to Berlin Germany had started operations. me, the most pleasant companion was in Niederschönhausen. There is a castle there where once a Prince of Hohenzollern[10] resided. Now this large area has been confiscated and cut off from the rest of the world by a massive wooden fence. Behind this large area lives the President of the East German Republic [GDR], Wilhelm Pieck, and some others of the hierarchy of Berlin. Among the President of the East German Republic [GDR], Wilhelm Pieck, and some others of the hierarchy of the new state is Arnold Zweig. Arnold Zweig's wife was one of me, the most pleasant companion's pupils in the VII Religious School of the Jewish Community almost fifty years ago; me, the most pleasant companion accepted an invitation from His wife, and thus was able for a short time to see the area behind a massive wooden fence. Arnold Zweig lives in the manor house which Germany has granted to Arnold Zweig. Once the manor house which the government has granted to him had belonged to somebody else who is perhaps now wandering about as a DP [displaced person] without a home to go to. the manor house which the government has granted to him is splendidly equipped with furniture belonging to Berlin. ‘the manor house which the government has granted to him belongs to Berlin’ means the manor house which the government has granted to him has been confiscated and stolen from the manor house which the government has granted to him's owner. Communism, just like National Socialism and other revolutionary movements, has Communism's fellow-travellers. But Arnold Zweig is proud that Arnold Zweig's books have earned Arnold Zweig some furniture for Arnold Zweig's private use. Arnold Zweig was in Germany, in Haifa, but a German writer, an artist of the German language, cannot earn a living there. For Arnold Zweig and others of Arnold Zweig's circle Communism is him and others of his circle's religion. Arnold Zweig speaks about dialectical materialism like an orthodox Jew about the Torah of Moses. Arnold Zweig was about to travel to Berlin as the representative of the ‘All-German Democratic Government for Unity and Peace’, to attend the celebrations for the two hundredth anniversary of Goethe’s birth. The government Arnold Zweig represented had been installed just a fortnight before. Joseph Stalin’s letter of congratulations to President Wilhelm Pieck had been posted on many walls in the Russian sector, and the inaugural speech of Prime Minister Grotewohl was displayed on the advertising columns. Prime Minister Grotewohl had spoken like all the heads of government everywhere, in every country, no matter which system all the heads of government everywhere, in every country, no matter which system they represent represent. ‘The most important means to achieve our aims is to improve productivity.’ The seat of The government he represented is the former Ministry of Propaganda in the Wilhelmstrasse, opposite the former Reichskanzlei. the former Ministry of Propaganda in the Wilhelmstrasse, opposite the former Reichskanzlei was previously where the President of the East German Republic [GDR] got up to the President of the East German Republic [GDR]'s mischief. the former Reichskanzlei is flanked to the south by the former Ministry of Aviation, Göring’s creation once described as ‘megalomania in stone’, and to the north by Goebbels’ former Ministry, the whole symbolising the crazy arrogance and complete collapse of the National Socialist state. The evidence of the defeat is even more impressive elsewhere in the Russian sector than in the three others. One symbol directly at the entrance is the Brandenburg Gate. the Brandenburg Gate still exists, but the Brandenburg Gate is seriously damaged by gunfire, only one of the four horses remains and three of the Brandenburg Gate's feet were shot away with only one still sticking up into the air. Viktoria[11] has disappeared, in its place has been hoisted a large red flag. Like other monuments of Prussian grandeur the Neue Wache is burnt out and deserted. Across the gate there is a long banner on which is written ‘Let there be peace!’ The arsenal, with the Hall of Fame, is burnt out and partly destroyed. The trophies which were kept there have disappeared. A notice states that the Brandenburg Gate is to become a ‘House of Soviet Culture’. Russian propaganda is insistent and effective. Berlin is also partly burnt out and partly destroyed. Those rooms which can still be used have been turned to a large extent into co-operative shops; in some lecture halls, however, there are still lectures. The name of Berlin is no longer ‘Königliche Universität’ [Royal University] as The name of the University was called fifty years ago when me, the most pleasant companion was a student there, The name of the University is now ‘Humboldt Universität’. Somewhere in the west a ‘Freie Universität’ [Free University] has been founded which claims to be the genuine one. That is why there are large posters calling upon the students to defend the unity of the students's University just as the students's ancestors had done in 1848 [the year of the German Revolution] against that institution in the west which is splitting Berlin. In the building the propaganda for the Stakhanovite system is conspicuous. the Stakhanovite system is a new way of organising work. In the English press the Stakhanovite system is called a kind of modern slavery and the way in which The Allies have brought back slavery in Europe. The posters in Berlin present a very different idea. Pictures and texts show how Stakhanovite had one day beaten the record of some face worker because of the special way Stakhanovite had gone about Stakhanovite's work, how Stakhanovite had consequently been entrusted with organising his work and how Stakhanovite had increased the productivity of mining and of the whole economy in Germany with mining, in a way unheard of before. They say Stakhanovite's system will free the working masses from excessive work and will give the working masses liberty at last. May workers and employers decide who is right. In any case it is surprising to see how the Stakhanovite system is praised by one group as the way to paradise whereas others condemn the Stakhanovite system as the way to hell. me, the most pleasant companion have not seen a lot of Russian military personnel in Berlin. As in the other sectors and in central Germany, the occupation in the American sector is ‘invisible’. Only the police, among them a considerable number of females, seem from Only the police, among them a considerable number of females's outward appearance and uniforms to be Russian. But Only the police, among them a considerable number of females only look like Russians, in reality Only the police, among them a considerable number of females are Germans. There is greater poverty in Berlin than anywhere else. When you stop in the street you will be asked by well-dressed men, both young and old, if you perhaps need a guide. me, the most pleasant companion have received petitions and begging letters from persons unknown to me, the most pleasant companion and me, the most pleasant companion was told that people keep sending persons unknown to me in large quantities, hoping to get some money from time to time. the defeat is also demonstrated in the names of streets. The former ‘Kronprinzenallee’ [Crown Prince Avenue] in Erfurt is now called Clay Avenue[12] by West Berlin in grateful recognition of General Clay’s support. In The Russian zone one of the most beautiful streets is now called Thälmannstrasse[13]. Another street, in the Tiergarten, is now named Reichpietsch-Ufer [Reichpietsch Bank], to commemorate the sailor Ernst Reichpietsch, one of the leaders of the German navy rebellion in 1917, who was then shot. What will these streets be called in fifty or one hundred years, me, the most pleasant companion wonder. II Nowadays 7,500 Jews live in Berlin. 7,500 Jews is not many compared with the 173,000 in 1925. But Berlin is still by far the biggest Jewish Community in Germany, a fact which is very important. In Berlin single Jews are not condemned to live an extremely lonely life, in contrast to those in other places. Although 7,500 Jews live in very different districts all over Berlin 7,500 Jews can meet those that 7,500 Jews get on with. me, the most pleasant companion was invited by Dr Rosenberg, the senior consultant of the Jewish hospital. There were other guests there too. It was a pleasant evening, with most interesting conversations which could have taken place anywhere. To that extent life for a German Jew is easier and less dreary than in other places. me, the most pleasant companion was received by the Community leaders and learnt a lot. the Community leaders are convinced that the number of Jews in the Community leaders's Community is fairly constant and will remain so or at least will not change greatly within the foreseeable future. the Community leaders believe that on the whole migration has stopped, most of those who now live here have a special relationship with Berlin, many were born in Berlin. They will stay unless particular circumstances force them to emigrate. As everywhere else, it is mostly the elderly who explain that they want to stay here, where their jobs and pension are, rather than live abroad as beggars. They certainly sense the impending danger in Germany and particularly in Berlin, but they are resigned and say, quite rightly, that it is dangerous for them everywhere and that there is no security anywhere. But it is true, looking at the Jewish Community of all districts's administration board you can see that there is a strong desire to emigrate. There are different members now from four years ago, at the end of the war. The then Chairman, Kammergerichtsrat [Supreme Court Judge] Dr Fabian, has emigrated with The then Chairman, Kammergerichtsrat [Supreme Court Judge] Dr Fabian's family to Germany, probably because of The then Chairman, Kammergerichtsrat [Supreme Court Judge] Dr Fabian's children. For it is generally agreed that his children must not stay in Germany but must be prepared for emigration, to either Israel or elsewhere. Nobody thinks about life after the next two generations but they believe there will be a future within this time span. It seems that in Berlin comparatively more Jews are in employment than anywhere else. A register of the members of the Jewish Community of all districts, drawn up according to the members of the Community's jobs, was read out to me, the most pleasant companion in the the Jewish Community of all districts office, but so quickly that me, the most pleasant companion could not catch everything. A register of the members of the Community, drawn up according to their jobs comprises 1,100 names of people who are in work. If me, the most pleasant companion am not mistaken there are only four Jewish commercial travellers left. What is striking in Berlin, as everywhere, is the small number of doctors, because they can work almost anywhere, and so do not need to come back, unlike those of other professions. The number of jurists, however, is relatively large, as The number of jurists is everywhere. In Berlin there are fifty-one ‘juristische Personen’ [jurists] as they are called in the register. A register of the members of the Community, drawn up according to their jobs begins: Kammergerichtspräsident [President of the Supreme Court] 1, Senatspräsident [President of the Senate] 1. In fact, there are two supreme courts now, one for the western sector and one for the American sector. The President of the eastern Supreme Court, Dr Freund, is a very active member of the Jewish Community of all districts. There are twenty-seven lawyers. Whereas in other places there are few Jewish shops or none at all, the Community administration board in Berlin has set up shops for a number of members who thus earn enough to live on, although the legislative body and the Community administration board in Berlin try to replace the private shops with expropriated shops or those run by the co-operative or the ‘Handelsorganisation’, and the legislative body and the administration try to make life pretty difficult for the private shop owners by not delivering enough goods and in other ways. As already mentioned the Jews in all four sectors form a single Community and the Jews in all four sectors are proud of the Jews in all four sectors. The occupying powers have introduced The occupying powers's special system of administration almost everywhere. Thus in the British sector the English have replaced the function of the Lord Mayor by [appointing] a British Mayor. Here Berlin is represented by a citizen who is elected for one year and has the title ‘Lord Mayor’. But the head of the Community administration board in Berlin is a civil servant, elected for twelve years, whose title is ‘Oberstadtdirektor’ and who is in charge of the Community administration board in Berlin. The Russians have established something similar for the ecclesiastical administration, a board with a central office which belongs to the municipal authorities and which consists of representatives of all the denominations and also of similar groups such as the Unions of Spiritualists or of Anthroposophists. The representative of the Jewish Community of all districts, Sigmund Weltlinger, is so pleased with The representative of the Jewish Community, Sigmund Weltlinger's role, and prides The representative of the Jewish Community, Sigmund Weltlinger on the fact that the meetings of the Community administration board in Berlin are the only occasion when the mayors of the two municipal authorities which govern Berlin meet and shake hands. But it is not definite that this arrangement will last and this gives cause for concern. It is the Communists in the Jewish Community of all districts who demand the partition of the Jewish Community of all districts into two, one for the American sector and one for the three Western sectors. The seat of the administration is in the American sector, whereas the majority of the members live in the three Western sectors. One synagogue – in Pestalozzistrasse – has not been damaged at all. Others were damaged and have been repaired, while most of the synagogues were destroyed. New prayer rooms have been arranged for small groups, one in Joachimsthaler Strasse and one in the office building of the Jewish Community of all districts. The synagogues are too big for the few people who wish to worship. On Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur there are services in the Rykestrasse synagogue and on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur the Rykestrasse synagogue is fairly full. But the services on Pesach, Shavu’ot and Sukkot are not attended at all. Daily services as well as those on the Sabbath are held in a prayer room containing about eighty seats. me, the most pleasant companion gave a lecture there and a prayer room containing about eighty seats was quite full. In the Pestalozzistrasse synagogue me, the most pleasant companion gave another lecture. There may have been about the same number of people as in the Wilhelmstrasse, but in that huge room about the same number of people were lost, a depressing sight and a painful reminder of the fact that the clothes have become too big for the Jews of Berlin[14]. The same is true of other Communities. In Berlin, services are held in the small but beautiful synagogue of the Oppenheim Old People’s Home. services were always quite well attended. the Jewish Community of all districts still owns the big temple, but there are not enough members to fill the big temple and so the Jewish Community of all districts have let the big temple to the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk[15]. In the big auditorium there me, the most pleasant companion gave a lecture on the situation in Israel, the room was full of music stands and instruments. Here too, the clothes have become too big for the shrunken body. In the Pestalozzistrasse synagogue me, the most pleasant companion heard a real chasan [cantor] again for the first time in Germany. a real chasan [cantor]'s name is Nechama, a real chasan [cantor] is a Sephardic Jew from Salonika [Thessaloniki], spent a long time in a concentration camp [KZ], afterwards came to Berlin and now all a real chasan [cantor] wants is to emigrate to Germany because, as a real chasan [cantor] says, a real chasan [cantor]'s income in Berlin is too small. The way a real chasan [cantor] led the prayers was most beautiful, but a real chasan [cantor]'s reading [from the Torah] left much to be desired. In Berlin as well as in Berlin me, the most pleasant companion also saw a few children, two or three, at the service. a few children, two or three get a special treat: during the Kiddush [blessing] a few children, two or three walk up to the cantor and are allowed to drink what remains in the Kiddush cup. There are some teachers who give lessons, only a few on the whole, but at least a few children, two or three get an idea of what Hebrew and Judaism mean. the Jewish Community of all districts has engaged one preacher, Mr Riesenburger. one preacher, Mr Riesenburger performs wedding ceremonies and funerals. About one year ago an American organisation appointed young Steven Schwarzschild as liberal rabbi in Berlin. young Steven Schwarzschild got married here and young Steven Schwarzschild's wife, obviously an excellent social worker, manages the Berlin office of the Jewish Relief Unit. young Steven Schwarzschild belongs to the British or American administration and lives in the British sector, in a house that the military government has requisitioned for British officers and civil servants.

, the other one of her father and herself. But the father was taken from their flat some weeks ago; he had been employed as a civil servant by the authorities in the Russian sector and has been missing ever since. Nobody knows anything about this and that is why the little girl has been taken to the home. Under the same roof or next to it is one of the two old people’s homes. The rooms are nicely furnished and cosy. I asked one woman whether she liked it there. She said she did. But someone who must know about it, the Director or someone I think, told me that this was not possible. None of them has a room to themselves and people who live very close together soon get on one another’s nerves. Moreover the economic situations of the inmates vary widely, some are poorer than others, some get parcels, some don’t. This leads to envy, and you can’t stop it. This bad situation does not even change for the better when the lucky ones share some of their riches with the others. Yet I had a lovely fifteen minutes in the old people’s home. The oldest male Jew in Berlin lives there, Mr Falkenstein, a former glazier in Schlochau. He is ninety-nine years old. He was just sitting there with his kippah [yarmulke, or skullcap] on his head, and when he took it off you could see the most beautiful white hair, full and thick. Beside him lay his tefillin[18], he is a pious man. He puts them on every day and has his breakfast only when he has completed this. It takes him a long time now, until ten o’clock or half past ten. My companion told him that at his age he did not have to be so careful about this and said that I was an expert. But the old man did not accept this, explaining that he was almost one hundred years old and did not want to change the habits of a lifetime. But he too has joyful moments. Every afternoon at three o’clock he puts the radio on and then he can hear the voice of his grandson, who is an announcer. There is a radio in every room. As in other old people’s homes, the residents here who are not Jews are the non-Jewish spouses in mixed marriages. Twice I have visited the cemetery in Weissensee, in the Russian sector. It is beautifully kept, the fighting in Berlin has not destroyed its peace. In the office I asked about a grave that I wanted to see. It was found in no time with the help of a file. My parents’ graves are situated in a place of honour. On both sides – right and left – many people are buried whom I knew very well and who were close to me. Thus the visits to the cemetery were something of a spiritual reunion. On 30 October, two days before I had to return home, I attended a meeting of Jewish lawyers and other jurists. They had been summoned by the Community administration board. The Community is claiming the restitution of a large amount of land which they lost under Hitler through confiscation or in other ways. But apart from that there are more claims for restitution in Berlin than anywhere else. The Community has taken these on too. In order to pursue and deal with them they have just set up a compensation commission. Its Chairman is Mr Löwenthal, who also spoke at the meeting. The Jewish lawyers, however, are not happy with these activities on the part of the Community. They say it is their job to deal with these claims and they feel restricted by the actions of the Community and also of other interested people and in particular the big Jewish organisations abroad. These have founded their own institutions; two other institutions, JRSO, the Jewish Restitution Successor Organisation, and a bank for restitution, both with their headquarters in Frankfurt am Main, are pursuing the same aims. Many are hoping to work for this restitution and thus earn some money. The lawyers are embittered in particular by an article by Dr Strauss, a colleague who claimed in a New York newspaper that restitution should be enforced in Germany by foreign lawyers, either from England or from the United States. [He said] the moral standards of German lawyers had fallen, they did not keep their clients informed by carbon copy of any changes in their legal matters, as had been common practice previously, allegedly because of a lack of paper. He admitted, however, that the lawyers were intimidated, the Germans as well as the Jews; in short, one should not engage any lawyer in Germany, not even a Jewish one. The discussion produced some important insights. There are still fundamental questions open to discussion. The argument about whether Jews should be judges in these in these trials is still going on. In Berlin about 5,000 sites are claimed for restitution. Between 30,000 and 40,000 persons are said to be entitled to claim. A number of claimants are baptised Jews. The Community acts for them too. Lawyers complain about the difficulties they have with legal processes. The administrators of the sites do not provide any information to enquirers. There are high costs, and many of those entitled to claim cannot pay them. One lawyer called the briefs he has been given a collection of briefs of the poor. Another argued that these cases are not exclusively a matter of civil law. ‘The state has robbed us, and the state has to make up for it.’ But that is not easy. Who is to make up for the losses? One lawyer mentioned the fees for a certificate of inheritance. Another called it immoral that the state should demand a fee when they [the state] had murdered the person who left the inheritance. The meeting has given me a profound insight into the situation of the Russian as well as of the Western sectors. The underlying factors have become visible. On Shabbos [Sabbath],29-Oct, I took part in the service in the Pestalozzistrasse synagogue. The evening before I made a short speech on Neshamah Jethera [the spirit of the Sabbath], the other soul which usually sleeps and awakes on the Sabbath. The Sidrah [weekly portion of the Torah] was [on the subject of] Noah and so in my sermon I explained the idea of the Talmud that Noah had seen three worlds, one flourishing, one falling and one new-born. Our generation understands even better than our ancestors the truth which is expressed in these words. On Friday evening I had been invited to a meal by Dr Rosenberg and his wife. Later some more guests arrived, among them Sigmund Weltlinger and his wife. We had an extremely good conversation. On Monday I spent some time in the office the JRU, Jewish Relief Unit. One man, an electrical engineer, was in absolute despair. He wanted to emigrate to Australia with his family but an entry permit was refused because he lived in East Germany[19]. Nobody knew what to do. These are the special problems of the people in the Russian zone. The next day, Tuesday, I returned home. Just as on my journey to Germany Mr Bruchheimer was travelling with me, the most pleasant companion. I am sorry to say, this was the last time I was to see him. Not long after our return he was knocked down by a car and died immediately. Between seven and eight o’clock we arrived in Vlissingen and at eight o’clock went on board. The sea was calm, the night absolutely beautiful. Later there was fog which caused a delay. In the morning we arrived at Harwich. There was a big squadron of the British fleet in the harbour: destroyers, cruisers, battleships, a most impressive sight. The customs officers were very strict and it took a long time until the train was able to leave. But a few hours later we were at Liverpool Street station. Herbert was waiting for me. We had a shock because the customs officers in Harwich had stowed my luggage away so well that in London it could not be found straightaway. But soon we were able to relax and I was back in 18C Belsize Park, grateful for an extraordinary journey which had taken me back for six weeks to my former profession and which brought me into contact with what was left of my former world in West Germany and in Berlin, and also with a great deal of what has come back into being.

The Reichstag building survived the heavy bombing of Berlin but the fighting between the Soviets and Germans ended almost at the same time as the Reichstag was taken and heavily damaged and burnt by Soviet soldiers – there is a famous photo of a Soviet soldier hoisting the Soviet flag on the Reichstag.

13,"[""On Mrs Privat's's father's and mother's side, Mrs Privat's ancestors were baptised, since the years 1859 and 1823 respectively. When Mrs Privat's had to declare Mrs Privat's's origin to the Reichsschrifttumskammer, her 'Aryan' husband divorced Mrs Privat's, on 2 June 1938, in order to remain in the position of earning Mrs Privat's and her and their daughter's's daughter's subsistence. Although Mrs Privat's's Jewish descent was known to every neighbour at Lankwitz near Berlin, where her and their daughter's lived, as well as to the police and Gestapo, Mrs Privat's was not called up to do forced labour nor was Mrs Privat's deported. Mrs Privat's never knew, if it was due to a mistake of Gestapo or to the secret help of a kindly police officer, that Mrs Privat's has been spared (p.2, 4). Already in the year 1939, Gestapo had wrongly decided, that Mrs Privat's was to be considered as half-Jewish (p.2). 9. Further References : Dr. phil. Karl Privat; Ullstein book publishers (p.1).

Exempt From Deportation due to a Gestapo Error or Secret Help of a Non-Jew? Mrs Privat's am the daughter of Dr. phil. Robert Hirsch and his wife Anna, née Lehmann. Mrs Privat's's father’s parents were General Medical Adviser Prof. Dr. August Hirsch and General Medical Adviser Prof. Dr. August Hirsch's wife Pauline, née Friedlaender. These grandparents of Mrs Privat's had My father’s parents and My father’s parents's 3 children baptized in 1859 at the Dorotheenstaedtish Church in Berlin. Mrs Privat's's mother’s family was of Jewish descent, but Mrs Privat's's grandfather, Dr. Emil Lehmann in Hamburg, had already been baptized in 1823 as a child, even before my grandfather, Dr. Emil Lehmann in Hamburg,'s parents. From this entire background, it followed that Mrs Privat's had no relationship with the Jewish religion. After the Abitur (A-level exam) Mrs Privat's studied Classical Philology and Archaeology in Goettingen, Berlin and Marburg from 1917 – 1922, achieved Mrs Privat's's higher degree in Marburg in the same year and Mrs Privat's's PhD at the end of the same year in Berlin. After a brief professional employment at the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae in Munich, Mrs Privat's married Dr. phil. Karl Privat, Hamburg, on 17 April 1924. Mrs Privat's's husband was an “Aryan” and worked as editor at the publishing firm of Ullstein, (in Berlin), later German Publishing House. Consequently, Mrs Privat's's daughter and Mrs Privat's were initially not affected by the actions against the Jews by the Nazi government. my daughter and I were living in Lankwitz, an area entirely well disposed towards Hitler. Mrs Privat's's circle of acquaintances consisted mainly of Christian families who, despite certain reservations, were not particularly negatively inclined towards the Jewish religion. Nevertheless, not one person out of My circle of acquaintances withdrew from my daughter and I, limited contact with my daughter and I or hurt Mrs Privat's with insensitive remarks; quite the opposite, when Mrs Privat's's husband was unemployed (through the limitation of production at the publishing firm of Ullstein, (in Berlin), later German Publishing House publishers) between 1932 and the end of 1934, my daughter and I received the kindliest help. This, although it was widely known that Mrs Privat's was of Jewish extraction. In all political discussions, the the Jewish religion actions against the Jewish population were condemned emphatically from the very start. The only two incidents from these (early) days of the Jewish religion that Mrs Privat's can recall are 1) that the mother of a classmate of Mrs Privat's's daughter’s prevented Mrs Privat's's daughter from appearing as a Christmas Angel in the Christmas production at my daughter’s's school, and 2) that in February 1936 an official of the NSDAP occasionally appeared at my daughter and I's flat and demanded my daughter and I retract the flag. The National Socialist race laws only began to play a noticeable part in Mrs Privat's's life when Mrs Privat's's husband was asked, at the end of 1937, to present her father's's and Mrs Privat's's proof of descent at the National Documentation Chamber. In order to avoid endangering her father's's position at the publishing firm of Ullstein, (in Berlin), later German Publishing House and thus her father's's ability to support Mrs Privat's and Mrs Privat's's daughter, her father's divorced Mrs Privat's on 2 June 1938. Mrs Privat's was the innocent party as, at that time, the Jewish descent of one partner was no reason for a divorce. However, immediately after a divorce, Mrs Privat's's situation as a Jewess worsened, because on 17 July 1938 the order was given that required every Jew in Germany to hand in every Jew in Germany's passports, to request an ID card marked “J” and to inform, by the end of the year, three registry offices that every Jew in Germany (i.e. the women) would have the additional name “Sara” from 1 January 1939. Mrs Privat's believed that Mrs Privat's still had a small chance of avoiding this requirement. But when Mrs Privat's obtained Mrs Privat's's grandfather’s certificate of baptism from Hamburg, my grandfather’s certificate of baptism from Hamburg showed clearly that her father's was the son of two Jewish parents. This was not evident from Mrs Privat's's maternal grandmother’s certificate of baptism. Of course, Mrs Privat's was not able to conceal the Jewish descent of Mrs Privat's's paternal grandparents as two Jewish parents had been baptized as adults. In addition, the church authorities had noted on the extract from the church records which we had requested: “This baptism is considered in form and content a baptism of Jews.” As two Jewish parents were sufficient to make Mrs Privat's count as fully Jewish, Mrs Privat's consequently came into the category of this order. In 1937 Mrs Privat's had already once been summoned to the Gestapo to make declarations about Mrs Privat's's descent. Mrs Privat's had deliberately left open the question as to whether Mrs Privat's was fully or half Jewish in order not to endanger Mrs Privat's's sister’s emigration as half-Jewish. At the start of 1939, Mrs Privat's again received a request from the Gestapo to present Mrs Privat's's papers which Mrs Privat's did immediately. When Mrs Privat's enquired in May, Mrs Privat's was told that my papers were being examined at “a very high authority”. In July, the police in Lankwitz informed Mrs Privat's that my papers had been returned with the notification that Mrs Privat's was half-Jewish. This declaration must, of course, have been based on an error which was never cleared up. The police officer in Lankwitz who had issued Mrs Privat's's “J” ID card very kindly made sure that my “J” ID card would be taken back. Right until the end of the war, Mrs Privat's never possessed a normal ID card as Mrs Privat's did not want to go as far as to sign, against Mrs Privat's's better knowledge, that Mrs Privat's was not of full Jewish descent. Seen from the outside, Mrs Privat's was now relatively safe. However, Mrs Privat's had certainly put Mrs Privat's into a dangerous situation, because it was well-known that the most severe punishments were given for keeping one’s Jewish descent secret, and Mrs Privat's knew perfectly well what would happen if this deception was ever discovered. Mrs Privat's might therefore say that Mrs Privat's felt under extraordinary threat for the entire period of time until the end of the Jewish religion. Above all, Mrs Privat's had to this reason Mrs Privat's's papers from being examined again by any official organization. For this reason, it was impossible for Mrs Privat's take a job, in as far as Mrs Privat's was even allowed to work as a half-Jewess. Far more important than for Mrs Privat's was the decision about our descent for Mrs Privat's's daughter who was now considered “of mixed race II” which enabled my daughter who was now considered “of mixed race II” to stay at my daughter who was now considered “of mixed race II”'s school and take the Abitur (A-level exam), whereas my daughter who was now considered “of mixed race II” would have had to leave if “of mixed race I”. However, the situation became rather critical when Mrs Privat's learnt from a neighbour in our building that the security department of a branch of Siemens in Marienfelde where a neighbour in our building's husband had intended to install Mrs Privat's's daughter as an apprentice had been informed by the Gestapo that Mrs Privat's was fully Jewish and had to adopt the name Sara. Roughly at the same time, the Party in Lankwitz had begun a campaign against Mrs Privat's – something Mrs Privat's did not find out until after the war. Mrs Privat's's flat had already been allocated to someone else without Mrs Privat's's knowledge, and Mrs Privat's's removal was about to happen when the house, Lankwitz, Muehlstrasse 39 a, was destroyed by a bomb on 24 August 1943, which made the impending orders null and void. Mrs Privat's's neighbours told Mrs Privat's after the war that – whilst Mrs Privat's still had great illusions about the safety of Mrs Privat's's situation – My neighbours had expected night after night that Mrs Privat's would be arrested. As Mrs Privat's was convinced that the Lankwitz police had Mrs Privat's registered as “mixed race I”, Mrs Privat's avoided for as long as possible registering with the police elsewhere. For a few months, Mrs Privat's therefore lived illegally at various addresses until Mrs Privat's left Berlin eventually and took on the position of housekeeper with the actress Brigitte Horney in Babelsberg. At the actress Brigitte Horney in Babelsberg's house, Mrs Privat's experienced the collapse and the occupation by the Russians. Naturally, Mrs Privat's's worries had increased greatly when towards the end of 1943 the privileges for divorcees from mixed marriages were cancelled, because now Mrs Privat's had to be aware that, even though one department had Mrs Privat's registered as half-Jewish, another might take a closer look and initiate Mrs Privat's's deportation to Theresienstadt. Luckily, this did not happen. Equally, Mrs Privat's was never obliged to do forced labour, which was the rule for half-Jews, because the police in Lankwitz had transferred Mrs Privat's's details to the police in Hamburg without the annotation “ Half-Jew” or “mixed race I”. Mrs Privat's never found out with any certainty whether Mrs Privat's's salvation was due to the humanity of the police officer in Lankwitz who had always been helpful, or whether this was an error by the Gestapo. In fact, after the war, Mrs Privat's had repeated difficulties in convincing official institutions of the truthfulness of Mrs Privat's's “fantastical story”, as official institutions called it. Grotesquely, Mrs Privat's had to present the documents of Mrs Privat's's descent in order to prove that Mrs Privat's's statements were the truth.

Mrs Schneider, a Brave Old Lady from Potsdam In July 1944, I met an extraordinarily brave woman, “Muttchen” (Old Lady) Schneider, who lived at Wielandstr. 22, Potsdam.

But this was soon not enough for the “Muttchen Schneider” of Potsdam who had turned from an enthusiastic Hitler follower to a courageous resistance fighter, and whose personal sacrifices brought about her premature death. From 1942 onwards, the “Muttchen Schneider” of Potsdam who had turned from an enthusiastic Hitler follower to a courageous resistance fighter, and whose personal sacrifices brought about her premature death constantly hid destitute illegal Jews in the “Muttchen Schneider” of Potsdam who had turned from an enthusiastic Hitler follower to a courageous resistance fighter, and whose personal sacrifices brought about her premature death's home. One of destitute illegal Jews was Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees. Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees did this out of a sense of justice, humanity and to make some amends for Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees's earlier support for Hitler, which made Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees feel like Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees was partly to blame. When Dr Harald Pölchau, a chaplain at Plötzensee Prison told Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees about my situation, Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees took my situation a step further and actively helped resistance by hiding a fleeing prisoner for the Baum Group, a Communist resistance movement, in Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees's home. Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees clearly understood the consequences of getting caught, which could only mean death. Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees offered me shelter, shared Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees's food rations with me and showed me human kindness. Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees did not have it easy with me. Night after night when I first escaped, I would wake up screaming, and the walls of this new-build apartment were thin. The one week I was supposed to stay with Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees became five long weeks, which must have got on Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees's nerves. But Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees never made those feelings known to me. Then Dr Harald Pölchau - 2 - surprised me with some forged documents and a new place to live in Breslau. At the time, the trains to Breslau departed from Oranienburg, and I had to get there on the S-Bahn commuter train from Potsdam. I needed to change trains at Gesundbrunnen station, near where I used to live. I was really well known to the Gestapo informants, and I was now really scared of taking this journey. So Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees did one last thing for me: Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees came with me to Oranienburg and disguised me as a typical Potsdam local. I later found out that Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees sheltered more “Herzblättchen” (little sweethearts), as Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees called the illegals. When I went back to find Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees in autumn 1945, Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees was so weak as a result of the years of hunger (Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees had always shared Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees's food rations from 1942 onwards). Despite the fact that we took care of Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees, Frau Latte of Breslau, one of Frau Schneider's “underground” protegees wasted away and passed away part way through 1946.

There was an expulsion in Stettin on 13th January 1942, a so-called deportation. Of 35,000 Jews 1,200 were selected and the rest were sent to Treblinka. Treblinka was a camp that had been in existence since 1942 and where thousands of people were killed on a daily basis. As far as I know, people were taken there in wagons, the floor of the wagon opened up, people fell into ditches and there people were gassed and burnt. I saw with my own eyes how during an expulsion in Radom on 13th January 1942, a so-called deportation small children were grabbed by the legs and flung head first against the wall, so that small children's skulls shattered and small children's brains gushed out. Women who were expecting, had Women who were expecting's stomachs slit open with swords. Those who were somewhat frail or sick were pushed to the ground and immediately shot dead. Families were forcibly torn apart. This all happened under the leadership of Boettcher, Haupsturmfuehrer Blum and Untersturmfuehrer Hans Schippers. Those who were left over after an expulsion in Radom on 13th January 1942, a so-called deportation were taken to a concentration camp on the Szkollna. Selections took place there time and time again. Children, old people, frail people were selected based on Children, old people, frail people's previous ordeals, and Children, old people, frail people were shot and killed. On 3rd of March 1942 We, my mother and 5 children were the transport to Maidanek - Leipzig, on the pretence that We, my mother and 5 children were being taken to a better camp. Meanwhile my elder brother had emigrated, in 1940 my elder brother had managed to travel to Switzerland and to emigrate to Germany. We, my mother and 5 children were separated from my brothers in Gross-Rosen, my sister, my mother and I remained together. When We, my mother and 5 children reached Gross-Rosen, We, my mother and 5 children had to undress fully in front of Obersturmfuehrer Dr. Blanke, senior doctor in Gross-Rosen, and the Oberaufseherin Elfriede Schroeder (the Oberaufseherin Elfriede Schroeder certainly had the deaths of around 5,000 - 2 - children on the Oberaufseherin Elfriede Schroeder's hands), various valuables were taken from We, my mother and 5 children, We, my mother and 5 children were inspected from top to toe, in case We, my mother and 5 children had any hidden valuables. Any rings on fingers, which could not be pulled off, were removed with shears. If anyone had earrings, then the earlobe was simply cut off, it made no difference at all. We, my mother and 5 children were then bundled into a bathing area, where there was hardly enough water to make We, my mother and 5 children wet, then We, my mother and 5 children were bundled out into a cold room, where We, my mother and 5 children had to wait for hours on end until each of We, my mother and 5 children received a torn and flea-ridden shirt that was completely the wrong size, some clothes and heavy clogs. It all happened terribly quickly. If anyone was unable to get dressed in a hurry they were beaten, and then We, my mother and 5 children were bundled in front of the orderly room, where We, my mother and 5 children had to wait all day long, until We, my mother and 5 children had been registered. We, my mother and 5 children received We, my mother and 5 children's own completed records and a death sentence to sign. On arrival at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp We, my mother and 5 children were separated from the men from the transport and We, my mother and 5 children had no opportunity to speak to the men from the transport ever again. If We, my mother and 5 children happened to meet the men from the transport on the way to work, We, my mother and 5 children were not allowed to look at the men from the transport, otherwise We, my mother and 5 children would be beaten. Some female supervisors battered the women obsessively, Some female supervisors were Luise Danz, Erna Ehlert, Alice Orlowska, Meier, Ruth Untersturmfuehrer Hans Schippers and Mrs Weber. We also had prisoner-capos, women, who were previous society misfits and who were the most despicable people imaginable. The death angel of Gross-Rosen, the murderer of 1942, was called Obersturmfuehrer Tuman. Whenever The death angel of Maidanek, the murderer of 1942 crossed the street with The death angel of Maidanek, the murderer of 1942's dog, you knew, that he, The death angel of Maidanek, the murderer of 1942, was going to shoot and kill some victims that same day. Up until 1943 people were suffocated in disinfection ovens, after that crematoriums were built. Various small children were escorted to disinfection ovens by Oberaufseherin Schroeder Oberaufseherin Schroeder herself, with promises of chocolate. The men, principally the Jewish men, had a terrible time. German career criminals, who were mainly dressed as hangman-capos in red hangman outfits, took charge of the internal administration of the male camps. Whenever a detachment (whether male or female) went out to work, a detachment (whether male or female) received orders to bring back only 100 of the 300. The capos had to kill a detachment (whether male or female) with The capos's bare hands (The capos weren’t given any guns for this purpose), and the survivors were made to drag the dead all the way back after the survivors's hard labour. The capos carried out The capos's executions with glee. The SS men and women roared with laughter, as the bone-weary people towed the corpses back. At the start of 1943, those people who were deemed to be strong, were transported to Plaszow near Cracow. Plaszow near Cracow was a camp where nearly all the women worked in the stone quarry and where the standards of hygiene were particularly atrocious. Haupsturmfuehrer Blum and Weinreich also came to Plasznow together with Haupsturmfuehrer Blum and Weinreich's staff, and carried on with the same rigmarole as Haupsturmfuehrer Blum and Weinreich had in Gross-Rosen. In June, at the height of summer, We, my mother and 5 children were deprived - 3 - of water for 4 days. People, who were working in the stone quarry under the hot sun, had to swelter without water. I was made to work in a brickyard and had to carry out heavy duties on three machines all at the same time, without any eye protection or anything similar, and I had to work 12 hours a day. Hauptsturmfuehrer Gett was the camp commandant, who derived particular pleasure from frequently having 20 men this spectacle, and thousands of prisoners were made to watch this spectacle. It was impossible to stay alive for more than 3 months with the provisions they gave We, my mother and 5 children there. The work shift leader was Untersturmfuehrer Mueller. The work shift leader had the habit of walking between the workers with The work shift leader's large dog, and letting his large dog molest these people, and in so doing these people were mauled and lacerated. I witnessed this happening. The work shift leader and The work shift leader's staff lived in a splendid palace, which Jews had built for The work shift leader. Camp commandant Gett and his staff allowed Jews to cook Jews's meals and wait upon Jews, whilst at the same time allowing others to be trampled by horses or to be killed with revolvers. In August We, my mother and 5 children were then transported from there and taken to a camp in Wilhemsburg, which had been rebuilt, and where 700 women and 1,500 men were made to work in salt mines. The work 700 women had to do was terrible and not one woman was able to cope with The work the women had to do. The SS Untersturmfuehrers, who supervised the work, laid explosives in salt mines, i.e. at the work sites, The SS Untersturmfuehrers, who supervised the work then hounded 700 women into 700 women and thereby killed a very large number of 700 women on a daily basis, and then The SS Untersturmfuehrers, who supervised the work boasted about 700 women's heroic exploits in the evenings. We, my mother and 5 children were sent to Plaszow again 3 months later, where We, my mother and 5 children worked in a laundry and then, after a short period of time, We, my mother and 5 children were sent to Auschwitz. On arriving in Auschwitz, as a result of a three year spell in concentration camps, We, my mother and 5 children were given the privilege of being the first to be selected for a bath. We, my mother and 5 children were brought into the sauna in order to bathe, and there We, my mother and 5 children had to stand naked for 12 hours in front of men, then Dr. Mengele and Dr. Tilo awaited us, who with the greatest cruelty imaginable, sent people to die with a point of the finger. Most people went to the gas chamber. And the 500 survivors of 700 women and 1,500 men, were squashed together like animals, naked, and herded into the so-called hairdressing salon, where various hairs on the head and body were cut off. The fortunate ones who survived, hairless and injured from the shootings with the Ukranians, went into a hall, where The fortunate ones who survived, hairless and injured from the beatings were wetted with a little vinegar, herded out again and then handed over to the female supervisors, who looked terrifying, were drunk, and acted in a totally arbitrary manner. On leaving a hall, where they were wetted with a little vinegar the female supervisors, who looked terrifying, were drunk, and acted in a totally arbitrary manner were then marched into the Sachsenhausen concentration camp wearing the female supervisors, who looked terrifying, were drunk, and acted in a totally arbitrary manner's most ridiculous clothing, and at the crematorium the female supervisors, who looked terrifying, were drunk, and acted in a totally arbitrary manner encountered those people who had been selected by the doctor, still standing and waiting, looking at We, my mother and 5 children through those people who had been selected by the doctor, still standing and waiting, looking at us through their deeply unhappy eyes's deeply unhappy eyes. We, my mother and 5 children arrived at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Words cannot describe the conditions in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. 700 women slept on a plank bed just 2m long. The hunger was indescribable. Whoever went to see doctor or signed in sick, was certain to die. Every day - 4 - Dr. Mengele and Dr. Tilo commenced Haupsturmfuehrer Blum and Weinreich's selections afresh, and every day new victims were selected. On one day there was a particularly horrendous selection. 700 women were pushed in front of the blocks, naked (the terrain was very marshy and a source of malaria), 700 women's feet were bound together by the capos, then Dr. Tilo and Dr. Tilo came and ordered 700 women to run. Because this was an impossible thing to do, most of 700 women couldn’t do as most of the women had been ordered, and so most of the women were torn apart by the Zugfuehrers’ dogs. I lost 3 of my best female friends in this way. this way resembled a play from the time of Nero. On another occasion Haupsturmfuehrer Blum and Weinreich made a selection of adolescent boys, who had come to Auschwitz in 1942, from Slovakia, mostly boys between 18 and 22 years of age. 700 women were led into a barrack building, where a play was due to be put on. The girls, who also arrived on this transport, were invited to this prologue and The girls, who also arrived on this transport had to sit there and watch, as 700 women were gradually led in and torn apart by fierce starved dogs. 700 women were often relatives of these unfortunates. They nearly all went mad, were loaded onto muck lorries and taken into the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. This and similar types of theatre was played out in Gross-Rosen on a daily basis. At that time there was a well-known institution in Auschwitz, where, similarly under the leadership of Dr. Mengele and Trilo, young German doctors used to practice medicine on living human beings. Every day prisoners, who looked as if prisoners, who looked as if they were just about still alive were just about still alive, were hauled to a camp in Wilhemsburg, which had been rebuilt, and where 700 women and 1,500 men were made to work in salt mines and there prisoners, who looked as if they were just about still alive had prisoners, who looked as if they were just about still alive's blood taken, a half a litre at a time. This procedure was carried out on myself twice. Others were these injections with malaria or typhus. After these injections these illnesses took hold in such a virulent manner, that it was impossible to offer up any resistance. I managed twice, with a lot of effort, to escape from such a fate. However, it wasn’t long before malaria took hold and we, my mother, my sister and me, were brought back to Maidanek as malaria sufferers at the start of 1944. When we, my mother, my sister and me arrived we, my mother, my sister and me met just 340 Jewish women from the whole Maidanek community. just 340 Jewish women from the whole Maidanek community were the 350 survivors from the Aktion of 3rd November 1943. On 3rd November 1943 30,000 Jewish men and women had been shot and killed from 6 in the morning until 9 in the evening. The executions were led by Untersturmfuehrer Tuman and took place in the following manner: people marched naked onto the so-called sixth field, the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, and each of people was provided with just one shot, it didn’t matter whether just one shot was fatal or just wounding, people fell into the ditches which Jews had dug earlier. According to statements from the crematorium workers many of people were still alive 3 days later and people were pulled alive from under the earth and set alight. I heard about this from a young woman, who was present at an Aktion and who was made to watch the death of a young woman, who was present at this Aktion and who was made to watch the death of her husband, without being able to accompany him's husband, without being able to accompany her husband. The 350 women and 150 men, who were left over after an Aktion, who were all the healthiest and strongest of the many thousands, were provided with an A, which - 5 - stood for Aktionsjuden, and The 350 women and 150 men, who were left over after the Aktion, who were all the healthiest and strongest of the many thousands were sent to the crematorium in Auschwitz at the earliest opportunity, because The 350 women and 150 men, who were left over after the Aktion, who were all the healthiest and strongest of the many thousands had refused to die in the crematorium in Maidanek after what The 350 women and 150 men, who were left over after the Aktion, who were all the healthiest and strongest of the many thousands had experienced. The Maidanek camp was disbanded in October 1944 because the Russians were approaching and We, my mother and 5 children were sent back to Auschwitz. When We, my mother and 5 children arrived back in Birkenau We, my mother and 5 children experienced the same procedure as before, and any short hair which had grown back was once again cut off. This time, however, Dr. Mengele did not spare We, my mother and 5 children and Dr. Mengele selected my sister as one of those to go into the so-called sixth field, the crematorium field. I managed to get hold of a Russian prisoner of war outfit, to wrap my sister up in a bundle of clothes and so get my sister away from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. It was a moment’s good fortune, one second later and it would have been impossible to get my sister out of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. When We, my mother and 5 children got to Birkenau, We, my mother and 5 children were selected for a work group for forced labour. I enrolled as a female printer, although I had no idea what the work entailed, and I managed, after being whipped by Oberaufseherin Zarecka, to take my mother and my sister with me. We, my mother and 5 children were supposed to go to Auschwitz to Himmler’s Musterlager (model camp). Obersturmfuehrer Hessler was the leader of Himmler’s Musterlager (model camp). On the way into Auschwitz model camp We, my mother and 5 children were led through the the so-called FKL (Frauenkonzentrationslager, lit. womens concentration camp), meanwhile We, my mother and 5 children were selected a further 3 times by Dr. Mengele. We, my mother and 5 children remained in Auschwitz until the rapid approach of the Russian Front in January 1945. All of a sudden SS began to burn various files, and one evening We, my mother and 5 children were ordered to “decamp” and 100,000 human beings left the Auschwitz KZ with all the Auschwitz KZ's internees. We, my mother and 5 children always walked in groups and SS drove We, my mother and 5 children on throughout the night at such a pace that it was impossible to keep up. January cold, snow, attacking aircraft, etc. Anyone who sat down for a minute was immediately shot and killed. The thousands of dead who lay alongside the road showed We, my mother and 5 children the way. We, my mother and 5 children laid down for 8 days. Frozen to the bone and suffering from various illnesses We, my mother and 5 children eventually reached Gross-Rosen. Once there We, my mother and 5 children were still not fed in spite of having gone for 8 days without food, placed in open cattle trucks (150 people to a truck) and taken via Oranienburg, where We, my mother and 5 children were offloaded, to the female concentration camp at Ravensbrück. On arrival We, my mother and 5 children found 50 dead in each truck. However, 50 dead in each truck had fared better than those who had now arrived in Ravensbrück. Corpses are better looking than the women, who walked about in Ravensbrück. With the women, who walked about in Ravensbrück's heads shaven, in large wooden clogs, famished and covered in spots, in putrid-grey clothes in the icy January cold, the women, who walked about in Ravensbrück walked in the mud that came up to the women, who walked about in Ravensbrück's knees, and carried heavy stones on the women, who walked about in Ravensbrück's shoulders. the women, who walked about in Ravensbrück were followed around by female supervisors, amongst female supervisors was that Haserlow, the one with the mocking laugh, and that Haserlow, the one with the mocking laugh goaded the women, who walked about in Ravensbrück on with a dog whip. On arrival, however, We, my mother and 5 children were led into a barrack building with other transports from Auschwitz, a barrack building which normally had space for 100 people, - 6 - and 1,500 women were stuffed into a camp in Wilhemsburg, which had been rebuilt, and where 700 women and 1,500 men were made to work in salt mines. We, my mother and 5 children had gone for 8 days without water and food, We, my mother and 5 children had eaten only snow in the wagons, and when only snow did fall, almost all of us got typhoid from only snow, however We, my mother and 5 children were to starve for a further 7 days. There are no words to describe how cramped it was, and the supervisors just stood there and shook with laughter whenever a woman beat another one to death in order to find just a bit of space where a woman could lay a woman's head. It was impossible to get out of the so-called sixth field, the crematorium field because that was tantamount to being beaten to death by your co-habitants. This lasted 14 days. We, my mother and 5 children were led back into the main Ravensbrück camp and after a further 5 days, and after a further selection by the Untersturmfuehrer, We, my mother and 5 children were loaded into wagons and transported away. We, my mother and 5 children breathed a sigh of relief, but not for long. We, my mother and 5 children were taken to Malchow (Mecklenburg). Here there were already a further 1,000 women from Auschwitz, who worked in underground powder factories and who looked like corpses. On arrival, to We, my mother and 5 children's horror, We, my mother and 5 children encountered Oberaufseherin Schroeder herself. We, my mother and 5 children knew then that We, my mother and 5 children's fate was sealed. Oberaufseherin Schroeder herself withheld all the food from We, my mother and 5 children and let We, my mother and 5 children starve, albeit We, my mother and 5 children weren’t working. The daily death toll on the parade ground, where, depending on the mood of Oberaufseherin Schroeder herself We, my mother and 5 children would spend 4 or 5 hours, was 50 women on average. Always observant, Oberaufseherin Schroeder herself supervised the rows on the parade ground, where, depending on the mood of Mrs Danz we would spend 4 or 5 hours and if Oberaufseherin Schroeder herself saw a woman who didn’t look presentable, Oberaufseherin Schroeder herself would pull a woman who didn’t look presentable towards a woman who didn’t look presentable and beat a woman who didn’t look presentable until a woman who didn’t look presentable died. Words cannot describe the conditions in Gross-Rosen. Death by starvation is the worst type of death, typhoid was rife amongst the people. We, my mother and 5 children slept in a small barrack room, which had previously been used as a horse stable, on the floor with no blankets, which was the ideal breeding ground for epidemics. That lasted 3 months. The death rate and the epidemics became too great, and because the Russian Front was already approaching too close to send the people to the crematorium, Oberaufseherin Schroeder herself sent 2,000 women to Taucha near Leipzig in the belief that 2,000 women would be bombarded to death in the wagons. However, luck was on We, my mother and 5 children's side and We, my mother and 5 children travelled for 2 days and 2 nights without being caught out by a single bomb. We, my mother and 5 children reached Magdeburg right in the middle of a severe bombing raid on the station the station itself. We, my mother and 5 children's locomotive was bombed, several SS men were wounded, and yet none of We, my mother and 5 children fell victim to a severe bombing raid on the station itself. Consequently We, my mother and 5 children arrived safe and sound, much to the annoyance of Oberaufseherin Schroeder herself. We, my mother and 5 children were divided into two groups at this point, one part went to Leipzig-Gross-Rosen and the other one to Taucha-Hassage, We, my mother and 5 children were in Taucha-Hassage. the Sachsenhausen concentration camp was awful however; compared to We, my mother and 5 children's previous camp in Gross-Rosen this hell seemed like paradise. Every night We, my mother and 5 children had to lie in front of the barracks because of air raid warnings, guarded by the SS, who were scared that We, my mother and 5 children would spy on them. Then the final evacuations started. the Sachsenhausen concentration camp was disbanded and everything had to be taken further on foot, in no particular direction, in order, as the Germans used to say, - 7 - not to be murdered by the Americans or the Russians. We, my mother and 5 children knew that all this walking meant We, my mother and 5 children were going to die, because SS took those, who had not died of hunger or frozen to death on route, to a particular place where they were shot down. I undertook, that if I were to die, then it would be in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, and that I would no longer carry on walking. We, my mother and 5 children hid in a barrack building and lay there for 3 days. When We, my mother and 5 children looked out with We, my mother and 5 children's hearts thumping, only the gravely ill remained in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, i.e. those who were unfit for transportation, SS had partly retreated and the Volkssturm had taken over the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Words cannot describe how overjoyed We, my mother and 5 children were from that minute onwards. We, my mother and 5 children believed, and yet We, my mother and 5 children could not believe, that We, my mother and 5 children had been liberated. This was on 15th April. the sick people started to recuperate, and We, my mother and 5 children eagerly anticipated the Americans, who We, my mother and 5 children could hear firing in the distance. We, my mother and 5 children hoisted flags on top of the barracks, flags sewn together from various rags and representing all the nationalities of the 100 people left behind in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, and We, my mother and 5 children awaited the American troops with flowers in We, my mother and 5 children's hands. However We, my mother and 5 children's liberation was not to be that straightforward. On 18th April, three days after SS had withdrawn, two men came towards We, my mother and 5 children as We, my mother and 5 children were sitting down to lunch, two men had been severely burned, and no sooner had two men arrived than two men fell unconscious. The camp doctor, a Jewish Czech, examined two men more closely, and We, my mother and 5 children noticed how two men had burned feet, and that two men had fallen unconscious because of the pain. Gasping desperately two men told We, my mother and 5 children: Save two men from the fires. At that very moment We, my mother and 5 children saw how the Volkssturm men locked up the barracks containing the sick people, chased the others into the barracks containing the sick people, closed the window shutters and began to set fire to the barracks containing the sick people. We, my mother and 5 children were the only 10 healthy people in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Using all We, my mother and 5 children's strength We, my mother and 5 children opened the barracks containing the sick people and shouted to people to jump if people could. 6 healthy boys and 4 healthy girls ran from one barrack building to another and saved as many as 6 healthy boys and 4 healthy girls could, into the nearby garden, where We, my mother and 5 children covered the sick people with grass and flowers, so that no one could know what was there. We, my mother and 5 children managed to save just 50 people, because SS noticed what We, my mother and 5 children were up to. We, my mother and 5 children immediately started to run away on We, my mother and 5 children's own, in order to find cover, in different directions, presuming that the Americans must be somewhere around. We, my mother and 5 children ran approximately 5 kilometres in the awful uncertainty that We, my mother and 5 children didn’t know what would happen to those We, my mother and 5 children had left behind, and in the end We, my mother and 5 children came to a wood, where We, my mother and 5 children thought We, my mother and 5 children could take a breather. However, 3 cyclists, who had red crosses on their arms, came past at that very moment, and straight-faced, 3 cyclists, who had red crosses on their arms introduced 3 cyclists, who had red crosses on their arms as representatives of the American Red Cross. 3 cyclists, who had red crosses on their arms asked We, my mother and 5 children to wait a few minutes so that 3 cyclists, who had red crosses on their arms could bring We, my mother and 5 children food and bandages. Most of We, my mother and 5 children believed this charade. However, some of We, my mother and 5 children used all the strength in our bodies to convince them that this charade was just another SS hoax. We, my mother and 5 children's words turned out to be true. A few minutes later We, my mother and 5 children saw 10 cyclists with machine guns on 10 cyclists with machine guns on their shoulders, who were laughing wildly and getting closer to the wood's shoulders, who were laughing wildly and getting closer to a wood, where we thought we could take a breather. We, my mother and 5 children believed - 8 - the game was finally up, yet at the very last moment, We, my mother and 5 children caught sight of a small stream, which flowed nearby.

elp. Suddenly a child’s hand snuggled into mine. “Tante [Aunt],"[""Mrs Wolff had remained in Berlin throughout the Nazi terror. In 1942 Mrs Wolff was told to prepare for deportation. Mrs Wolff went to hide with non-Jewish friends, but on a pre-arranged signal returned to Mrs Wolff's home, when nobody had come for Mrs Wolff. Mrs Wolff's caretaker supplied Mrs Wolff with food. After a second threat of deportation which once again did not materialise, other Christian friends arranged for Mrs Wolff to work at Berlin airport so that Mrs Wolff could get an air ticket in an emergency. However, Mrs Wolff could not avail Mrs Wolff of this chance, as Mrs Wolff received yet another deportation order. Although non-Jews offered Mrs Wolff's refuge, Mrs Wolff arranged with another fugitive to flee to Switzerland. A Chistian woman gave Mrs Wolff Mrs Wolff's own identity card, others helped with food and the necessary preparations. The cook of friends in Frankfurt took the two women by train to the two women's parents’ in a little village near Frankfurt. From here the two women walked for miles, until the two women reached an inn beyond the German-Swiss frontier. A friendly frontier-guard took the two women to the police station in Hemmingshofen, who sent the two women to Schaffhausen, where the two women were imprisoned for illegal entry of Switzerland. The Jewish community there eventually arranged for the two women's transfer to a hostel and looked after the two women for six weeks. Meanwhile, the author could contact the author's lawyer in Switzerland to whom the author's daughter had sent money. Although her lawyer in Switzerland to whom the author’s daughter had sent money could identify the author’s daughter, the two women were sent to several refugee camps (Sumiswald, Kanton Emmenthal, a hotel in Lucern surrounded by barbed wire, Bökten and Liestal) until the two women met the daughter of a senior official who restored the two women to liberty. the author remained another two years in Switzerland and then joined the author's daughter in England. For some years the author’s daughter had a position as companion to an old lady, and now the author’s daughter lives in the Otto Schiff House in London. 9. Further References : Martha Steinitz, Quaker. Non-Jews helped Martha Steinitz, Quaker escape Elise Wolff, née Steinitz. Born: 15 April 1884 in Gleiwitz in Upper Silesia. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz moved to Berlin as a child. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz was married and had one daughter. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's husband died before the Nazi-era. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz didn’t want to leave Berlin when the Nazis came in order not to lose Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's financial independence. In 1942, Elise Wolff, née Steinitz received written notification that Elise Wolff, née Steinitz was to prepare for collection and deportation. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz immediately left Elise Wolff, née Steinitz home and moved in with Christian friends. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz got a message from Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's lodger, by means of a pre-arranged signal, saying that no one had come to fetch Elise Wolff, née Steinitz. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz went back to Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's apartment where the concierge secretly provided Elise Wolff, née Steinitz with food. After a few weeks, a further notification arrived informing Elise Wolff, née Steinitz that Elise Wolff, née Steinitz would be collected. Again, this was probably overlooked and in any case no one came. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz was now anxious and decided if possible to emigrate. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz felt very isolated as Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's telephone and radio had been taken and also Elise Wolff, née Steinitz had to give up Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's dog and bird. Jews were not allowed to travel on the trams but as Elise Wolff, née Steinitz didn’t look Jewish Elise Wolff, née Steinitz dared to go out without Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's Jewish star and use public transport. This meant that, on the advice of an acquaintance (Christin in a mixed marriage), Elise Wolff, née Steinitz could get to the job centre in Neuköln. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's acquaintance was in contact on Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's behalf with a gentleman who had taken preparatory steps for Elise Wolff, née Steinitz at the job centre in Neuköln. Here Elise Wolff, née Steinitz had no problems and was told Elise Wolff, née Steinitz should go to the airport (Göring Werk) and show the identification card given to Elise Wolff, née Steinitz for this purpose. If Elise Wolff, née Steinitz was then allowed to pass through, to go to the owner of the airport restaurant, where Elise Wolff, née Steinitz would get work. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz was taken on and had to start the following morning cleaning vegetables. The cost of this arrangement was 1,000 German marks. This play gave Elise Wolff, née Steinitz the opportunity to access the airport (Göring Werk) and get an airline ticket if Elise Wolff, née Steinitz needed to. However, this did not materialise. When Elise Wolff, née Steinitz got home from the airport (Göring Werk), Elise Wolff, née Steinitz found a further notification about her imminent collection, whereupon Elise Wolff, née Steinitz decided to leave Berlin immediately. Other Christian friends had offered to keep Elise Wolff, née Steinitz in hiding but this no longer felt safe enough. By chance Elise Wolff, née Steinitz learnt of another women who on that very same evening wanted to go over the ‘green border’ to Switzerland. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz said Elise Wolff, née Steinitz would go with Elise Wolff, née Steinitz. Everything was hastily put in place. Obtaining an identity card made out in a false name was a necessary precondition for the escape. Again help came from Christians: a woman lent Elise Wolff, née Steinitz a woman's postal identity card. a woman met Elise Wolff, née Steinitz at the railway station at an agreed time and gave her postal identity card to Elise Wolff, née Steinitz as well as providing Elise Wolff, née Steinitz with food for the journey. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz asked a passing soldier to get Elise Wolff, née Steinitz a ticket to Frankfurt am Main which a passing soldier handed over to Elise Wolff, née Steinitz. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz risked Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's escape with a ticket to Frankfurt am Main and Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's false identity card. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's travel companion met Elise Wolff, née Steinitz in front of the train as talked about. However, the two women travelled in different compartments, so as not to draw attention to the two women and be caught together. Once in Berlin the two women met in the waiting room. The cook for a family in Berlin, who had been told of the two women's arrival by Her travel companion, spoke to the two women in passing as it were and gave the two women a sign to follow Her travel companion. Her travel companion took the two women to Her travel companion's parents’ house in a small village not far from Berlin. the two women were peasant farmers who unsuspectingly took in the two women. The next morning, while the family and also the neighbours were at church, Elise Wolff, née Steinitz and Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's companion left secretly to make the two women's way to the German-Swiss frontier. the two women walked for four hours in the searing heat until the two women saw an inn, which the two women knew was located on the other side of the German-Swiss frontier. By this time the two women were extremely exhausted. Here the two women were given a warm welcome even though the greeting 'Heil Hitler' gave the two women a bit of a scare. It wasn’t long until a border guard appeared who Her travel companion had telephoned for the purpose of reporting the two women's arrival. a border guard appeared friendly but it was a border guard's duty to take the two women to the nearest police station. In the small village of Hemmingshofen the two women were handed over to another official who put the two women in a prison cell for the night. Here the two women could rest a little. another official who put them in a prison cell for the night brought the two women food and used the opportunity to rail against Hitler. The next day the two women were taken further to a destination unknown to the two women. the two women got out at the Swiss town Schaffhausen where the two women were imprisoned for illegally crossing the German-Swiss frontier. the two women were interrogated for two hours and had the two women's fingerprints taken. The local Jewish community was advised but the two women had to wait three days before the two women heard from the two women and were found accommodation in the hostel “Haus Martha”, where the two women were allowed to stay for six weeks at the expense of The local Jewish community. Meanwhile, the two women made contact with a Swiss lawyer who had been introduced to the two women in Berlin. a Swiss lawyer who had been introduced to them in Berlin identified a Swiss lawyer who had been introduced to them in Berlin to the two women and gave the two women the money Elise Wolff, née Steinitz daughter had transferred to a Swiss lawyer who had been introduced to them in Berlin. the two women were moved on further to Sumiswald, canton Emmenthel. Sumiswald, canton Emmenthel was a camp where 45 refugees lived and the care was good. From here the two women were sent on again – but this time to a comfortable hotel in Luzern, which was set up for refugees. The hotel grounds were enclosed behind barbed wire. After the two women were transported to a further two camps in Bökten and Liestal, the two women then had a chance encounter with a senior official in Thun, Swabia, whose father secured the two women's freedom. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz lived freely in Switzerland for another two years in various locations, partly as a guest and partly living off Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's own money. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz spent a total of four years in Switzerland and Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's verdict: Elise Wolff, née Steinitz said 'Elise Wolff, née Steinitz only ever had it good.' the author’s daughter lived in Spain until the author’s daughter left because of the civil war and moved to France. Then Quaker Mrs Martha Steinitz requested that the author’s daughter should be allowed to come to England. England the author’s daughter lived in Reading. the author’s daughter obtained entry to England for the author’s daughter's mother who at first lived with the author’s daughter. After four months Elise Wolff, née Steinitz took up the position of companion to an elderly lady – a position Elise Wolff, née Steinitz held for the next four years. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz then returned to live with Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's daughter until 1956, when Elise Wolff, née Steinitz moved to Otto Schiff House where I recorded this testimony. Comments on page 2: after repeated questioning Elise Wolff, née Steinitz indicated Elise Wolff, née Steinitz couldn’t remember exactly where the border crossing took place. Elise Wolff, née Steinitz said that Elise Wolff, née Steinitz travelled with Elise Wolff, née Steinitz's companion as far as Randolfszell, close to the German-Swiss frontier, but doesn’t remember if it was by train. There the two women were led by Her travel companion to Her travel companion parents. From here it was four hours and the two women ran across the German-Swiss frontier. Randolfszell is in Switzerland. ""]", a youngish woman, appeared to me, with her tangled frost-covered hair hanging down, like an old witch. She had no more strength in her stiffened hands to hold onto her child. The last blanket slid from my arm as I took hold of the trusting little hand. And so, the faltering man on one side, the child holding my hand, we came finally to a barracks camp surrounded by a fence. We were most probably among the last. When we came in, the spaces were already crammed full. Everyone lay exhausted on the ground which was partially covered with straw. No heating, but the presence of so many people generated [a] pleasant warmth after the march through the bitter cold. Here I suddenly met my eldest brother, who I had hoped had avoided deportation, as he had in his pocket the request from his wife who had gone on ahead to the U.S.A. in order to win back her American citizenship. His three children were also already in the U.S.A.. We silently shook hands, then he went on in order to help some old people. Also I discovered my father’s brother with his wife near me. Although almost 70[15] years old, he had, despite the gruelling journey, immediately made his medical knowledge available. We had 6 doctors among us, who were urgently needed, for there lay dead, dying, women giving birth, exhausted people, all mixed up. Also my sister, a sick woman herself, formerly a very valued Red Cross sister who during the nights of the journey had so bravely supported me, therefore had also hardly slept, set to work immediately. The former head of the funeral service, almost 70 years old, took on the task with some men of carrying out the dead, among them unidentified bodies. I was primarily concerned with calming my husband. But he refused to sit on the ground. He wanted to have ‘ordentliches Unterkommen’ [proper accommodation]. Then suddenly an Obersturmbannführer [‘SS rank equivalent to lieutenant colonel in the German army, also used by Sturmabteilung; SA; stormtroopers’][16] came up, looked around and then came up to me standing beside my husband, now completely collapsed. “What is wrong with your husband?” “He has collapsed.” He looked me in the face. “I have nothing to do with all that. I am the right hand of the Generalgouvernör [Governor General][17] and happened to be in Lublin. I wanted to see things for myself. I hate you...of course. But I am a human being. I want to help you. Your husband must go into hospital, into the Jewish hospital.” “And I am going with him.” “You cannot go with him, it is better for both of you.” He fetched a young Volksdeutscher, pointed to my husband and said, “Take this man to the Jewish hospital and let his wife know afterwards that you have handed him over.” He went away, my husband was fortunately not taken away. Who knows what they would have done to him. Sometime later the Obersturmbannführer came back with the Lagerkommandant [camp commandant] in SS uniform, bowed slightly and said, “One has just made it clear to me that an Obersturmbannführer has nothing to do with Jews. I cannot help you.” Suddenly the happy news spread that the Judenrat [one of the Jewish councils established by the Germans during World War Two][18] would send tea. And it arrived by the bucketful, but there was not enough for the multitude. So at first only the sick and weak were permitted to have any, and I do not forget the looks which pleadingly followed me when I, dispensing it, had to pass thirsty and yearning people. But we were permitted to take for ourselves some of the pure snow which lay in heaps piled up in front of the camp. I myself felt neither hunger nor thirst. I had hardly taken any nourishment at all for some days, or rather needed to. And then when later a good meal was given to me, my stomach, which was not used to it, could keep nothing down for days. Then came a new cry: the transport will be divided into 3 groups: Everyone tried to stay with their relatives and friends. My next of kin and I had no thought at all of attempting such a thing. Without discussing it amongst ourselves, each one was ready for his part to support the helpless people, borne by his own strength. In fact from then on each member of our family became, in the various places we stayed, completely as a matter of course, a support for the others, to whom one clung with all the cares and tribulations. Only later did I learn the meaning of the division into 3 groups. In the first group were the eldest, which my husband and I also joined, essentially the residents of the old people’s homes, who were sent to a small village near Lublin in view of the proximity of the Lublin hospital. The next group went to a larger village in the country, which was reached by sledge in 3 hours. And the third group comprised the younger people, rather was supposed to comprise them, who had to cover on foot a road to the camp which by sledge also took 3 hours. In all 3 villages lived Polish Jews. It was a bright, clear frosty afternoon when we were loaded, or rather pushed onto the sledges. Our barracks had to be vacated for Jewish soldiers, some of whom could already be seen. They were, so I heard later, released in the evening and sent out into the street in their shirts. It was for the ‘Judenrat’ to supply their clothes. Our sledges were wooden boxes on runners, on or in which one had to huddle up. Our group was supposed to travel for half an hour to our destination. We quickly came out of the village, were surprised at the many Jewish staff that we met, as we naively thought that every Jew who wore an armband with the Star of David was an employee of the Judenrat, which incidentally on leaving the camp put in another appearance to us. It had become alarmed and had already picked up the people who had collapsed off the country road and taken [them] to the hospital. In half an hour we should be at our destination. We had already been travelling for many half hours. The fields lay covered in snow on both sides of the road. Snow, snow, a never-ending snow covered plain. At last we arrived in a village. We were about to climb out of the sledges when black-uniformed men appeared and ordered, “Get back in, drive on!” And a man in uniform now also got onto each driver’s box and we travelled onward into the dying day. Snow, snow, nothing but snow. How much longer we drove I do not know. Then we arrived again in a village that lay there as if deserted. “Get out.” And anyone who did not get out quickly enough was helped by a bayonet from behind. And again the effect of my angry cry, “Leave the sick man,” when one wanted to push my husband out. Quite suddenly the sledges disappeared and we were standing alone on the village street, which was illuminated by the bright snow. My husband started to become delirious again. “Let me go to bed. I am so tired.” My strength almost failed in preventing him from lying in the snow. Then I saw the priest come out of the nearby church accompanied by a man. I went up to him and spoke to him in French. I asked for shelter for my sick husband and help for the old people who had come with me. He replied that we should wait for him here, he would come back soon. A ray of hope! After a considerable time he stood before us again. “The sick man with his wife and the doctor with his wife come with me. The others go quietly into the houses, where one will take you in.” We followed him into his kitchen. Pleasant warmth enfolded us. He told me to rub my husband’s hands and feet with snow which, very swollen, were stuck in the shoes, and the doctor who accompanied us had with him a hypodermic syringe and heart medication for his own use which he now gave to my husband. Round the big kitchen stove straw had been spread out; we settled ourselves down on it after we had been given hot tea. It did not just remain we four however, as yet others had found the way to the priest’s house and although the priest had said to us that he did not want to accommodate more than 4 people, we could not turn our fellow countrymen away. Everyone fell into a deep sleep. Then my husband started to become delirious again and to call for help. His voice rang out through the sleeping house. In vain we tried to calm him. I took him like a child into my arms, but in his delusion he did not recognise me. The doctor thought it was right to go to the priest and give him an explanation for what was happening to us. The result of that was that we were locked in with the urgent advice to move on the following morning. However for us things had been working out and help was nearby. I later discovered more details. The black devils had acted on their own authority and taken us contrary to the order to a Polish village. There the leader had gone to the Ortsversteher [village mayor] with the announcement, “I bring Jews.” “What am I supposed to do with them?” “Kill them.” The Polish village mayor contacted the Judenrat in Lublin and received the assurance that the following day sledges would be sent in order to take the deportees to their destination. The local Polish population had behaved in a thoroughly decent way towards us. Everyone had found somewhere to spend the night, and the teacher had ensured that a hot lunchtime soup would be provided for us for a small cost. Even my husband, who again and again fell back to sleep, greedily slurped the soup, was not to be moved however, [or] stand up when the sledges came so that we almost missed the connection. I did not know that it was an overwhelming weakness which held him back. Finally 2 young Poles were prepared at my request to carry him out for a reward. We lay him in the sledge, as far as the other occupants could make room, and in the absence of the lost blanket I covered him with his Ulster which he had brought with him as well as his fur coat. When I wanted to fetch my coat from the house it had been stolen with [the] muff and gloves and a derisive laughter rang out after me when I hurried back to the sledge because there was no more time left for me to look for [them]. And in the short interval the two young Poles had stolen the Ulster covering my husband. So I travelled bent over my husband, half kneeling, half lying, in order to give him shelter from the cold, and it will remain for me an eternal miracle that my ruined hands, with which I now had to hold onto the edge of the sledge without gloves, did not get frostbite. We travelled through the forest and [it was] not long before we came to a village, stopped in front of a little single-storey house and were greeted with a wild shout by a young lad. Before I knew what was happening, one had lifted my husband out and carried him into the house. I followed as quickly as I could, and I found him already carefully laid on straw in a large room. “E Mann mit nem Bort aus Deitschland! “ [A man with a beard from Germany]. My husband had a white goatee, which delighted the Jews with whom we had ended up, for they saw in the style of the beard a sign of religiousness. All the time new people were arriving, mostly women and children, and staring at my husband. Helpful hands gave him tea, as well as milk and food. Everyone looked after him and I did not suspect that we were in the poorest Jewish village and every gift meant deprivation for the giver. “Eir Mann?” [Your husband?] “How old?” “So olt!” [So old!] “How many children?” “No children?” Not to echo the tone of sympathy, for wealth of children is the only wealth which these poorest of the poor proudly enjoy. The large room in which we found ourselves, similar to a barn, was the prayer room of the Jewish village. The orthodox rabbi with [his] wife and 5 children lived in the same house but did not allow himself to be seen. He held himself back from us because he could not communicate with us, and it was a long time before I had overcome his shyness at dealing with a woman and learned to appreciate him in joint work to provide care. He was a young man, a Polish-Jewish beauty, with such good manners, as if he had not been brought up in a miserable Jewish village, but out in the wide world, who had obviously taken over the running of the relief operation. He initiated night watches and stayed watching with us himself. My request for water for washing embarrassed him. Eventually he brought in a small cup of water, told me to reach out my hands and wet them. He was obviously not used to greater cleaning. I dared to ask him for a bed for my husband. “Forgive me, there is no bed,” he replied with embarrassment, visibly anxious to speak hochdeutsch [High German; standard German]. But the following morning after we had been revived with tea (there was no food) he came to me and said, “Mei Vader is a frummer Mann. Er mecht gern haben den Mann mit dem Bort. Kimmt mit.” [My father is a religious man. He would like to have the man with the beard. Come with me]. We supported my husband along the short road and so for the first time entered the miserable dwelling of a Polish Jew. Through an unpaved hallway we came into a narrow one-windowed room. Right in the corner against the smoke-stained wall stood the square, brick built stove. The woman of the house did not move from her spot. All the time she stirred the soup which with some dry bread constitutes the food for the day and which is shared out between the numerous family at no particular time, but one is in the habit of eating when the person concerned “hingert” [is hungry]. While our housewife was wielding the cooking spoon with one hand so that the thin watery soup did not stick, she held the prayer book with the other hand. All the time that I was in the room with her she did not put the book down, and from her lips I saw that she was engrossed in the contents. She did not greet us, pointed us with a movement of her head to the beds which stood with a narrow space between them near the window. In one of the beds that did not have very clean linen (I did not know then what great possessions bed linen and a bed are) my husband had been laid. The woman now came up and without speaking gave me a velvet pouch. I knew that the religious Jews kept their tefillin in such pouches, but I was at a loss to know what to do with it. So I laid it hesitantly next to my husband who had immediately fallen asleep again. Then such a contemptuous expression passed across the silent woman’s face that I felt deeply humiliated by how greatly I had disappointed her, because she had granted her help to unworthy people. She went back to the stove and took no more notice of us at all. I dared not ask her for some soup for my husband. However when the son, our young protector, came in, he gave my silent husband a glass of that indefinable soup, which from then on became the habitual meal for my fellow countrymen. The Jews in the small villages are very orthodox and do not permit the consumption of meat that is not kosher. And such meat was scarce, and when found, then only with great sacrifices, therefore the ingredients of the soup are vegetables, of which there are hardly any in winter, cooked in a lot of water. Of course one also used flour and semolina, where these milled products are to be had. No wonder that the bodies of my fellow countrymen, who were not used to a diet so low in fat, lost on average15 kg. in the first 3 months. It was possible later through the representatives of the Joint in Warsaw, the JEAS [Jewish Emigrant Aid Society],[19] to improve the food somewhat. But however often I tried to discuss the question of meat, it was pointed out to me that the question was not open to debate. In the meantime the doctor and the helpful fellow countryman who had taken care of the burials had been able to travel to Lublin and had managed to have my husband admitted into the hospital there. We went there on the very same day. I was very worried that my husband would not stay without me in the hospital, but he was much too weak to understand what was happening to him. Not even [the fact] that that he had been laid on a stretcher for want of a bed, and that it was not possible after 5 days to get undressed and change his clothes, to say nothing of getting washed, penetrated his consciousness. In the ward where my husband had been taken there were already many fellow countrymen, a few in beds, most on straw, men and women mixed up together. They were, as I later discovered, those unfortunate people who had been left behind on the country road when we arrived in the village, found by the alerted Judenrat and almost all had been taken to hospital with severe frostbite. They were all shocked about the primitive conditions of admittance and even I could scarcely disguise my astonishment at the conditions that I found there. I had during my work as Stadtrat [city councillor] collaborated very intensively with the healthcare services and gained a deep insight into the question of hospitals. What I have seen here struck everyone like a slap in the face [given] what we understood by the concept of hygiene. Admittedly the room was large and bright, if also very overcrowded. There was also a washbasin with running water that did not run however, and a tiled stove which was only lit at noon after long efforts by an old man with damp wood [and] gave out some heat towards evening. But there was no bed linen, no towel, no soap, no glass. A single enamel cup served the whole ward of 20 people. Nobody was washed, nobody undressed. A single bedpan, no bottle, a single catheter were available. One sister struggled, using girls brought in off the street, with the care of the sick, which essentially consisted of the distribution of the meagre food. There was in the morning a thin coffee and two dry slices of bread, at noon alternately boiled black carrots and mashed potato, not freshly made, or beetroot with mashed potato, and in the evening a cup of tea with dry white bread. Only the doctor admitting [the patients] was wonderful in his warm humanity. Only later, when I was on familiar terms with the doctors and staff did I learn that this was also for them an unusual and unbearable state, into which they had been forced by the occupation. The following had taken place: the small Jewish hospital with [a] ground floor and one storey was, if I remember correctly, equipped for 120 people. It had sufficient and qualified Spezialärzte [specialist doctors] and equipment, a well trained Oberschwester [matron] and less well trained, but several, Hilfsschwestern [auxiliary nurses]. Shortly before we came, a spotted fever epidemic had come to an end, and there was still much material being disinfected; also some wards were closed when 30 bedsteads with all the supplies of beds and linen, a lot of medication, dressings and above all modern instruments were seized by the German military. At the objection [as to] how was one supposed to accommodate the sick came the short reply, “Jews need no beds. [They] can sleep on the floor.” Immediately after this came our invasion, which in the first weeks amounted to up to 80 people per day, so that we turned the whole running of the hospital on its head and local patients could not be admitted quickly enough. When one knows all this, one cannot be sufficiently grateful for the fact that the doctors did not refuse to grant at least refuge under their surveillance. More was in many cases not necessary for the deportees who were now flooding back from the three villages. In the following months it was possible to improve these conditions, as admission into hospital was placed under strict medical supervision. Nursing staff were not available for the two wards in which my fellow countrymen had been placed. I therefore timidly asked the Oberschwester whether one would allow me to assist the Stationsschwester [ward sister] who had taken over the principal running of our section in addition to her other duties. It was important to me to stay near my husband and it was clear that my mere presence calmed the sick. However one was at first reluctant to agree. One was obviously afraid that I would not take orders. When one saw however that I did follow orders completely, did not even favour my husband when sharing out food, one made use of my help increasingly. Especially with listless patients who refused to take nourishment. Thus I remember one of our most well-bred women who lay apparently unconscious in bed and did not respond to the sister. I called her by her name at which she immediately opened her eyes. “You see, it is I and [I am] bringing you [something] to eat.” “I do not want anything to eat, one brings me excrement and urine.” “But how can you say such a thing. Here lies my husband. I am feeding first him and then you. I have promised your daughter to look after you.” (How many lies crossed my lips back then. It was all the same to me if in this way I could give emotional support and a peaceful death).[20] I managed to give her nourishment for some days. But then she also closed her mind to me. I felt that she no longer had the will to live. She would never again see her daughter who was in a mixed marriage or her grandchildren. Why torture her? And she fell asleep, so gently, as I saw many die. Also my husband, who lay there almost always sleeping and did not know how badly [his] hands and feet were covered in blood and pus, which [had] not been washed, which had not been bandaged except with a first-aid dressing which I myself had put on with a shirt I had been given and torn into strips, he also died in his clothing which he had not taken off since the deportation, a gentle death. And at the last moment his wife was not with him! When I entered the ward in the morning, I found the familiar face no more. I had become accustomed to see death come. Down there it had lost his terror for me. Each day when I came into the hospital the doctor reported to me who had died during the night. And my reason replied, “It is for the best.” Amongst the difficulties in which we placed the Jews of the villages where we had been taken in were not least the fatalities. In the small village where I had been initially with my husband the annual death rate is e.g. not as high as the number of dead which we supplied already in the first quarter. The Lublin cemetery is certainly large, and the Judenrat marked out in a very far-sighted way a free section for the deportees. One of the first in this foreign soil was my husband. It was not easy to find out when the funeral was to take place. But the fellow countryman who had from the early days taken care of the burials gave me the information and accompanied me to the nearby cemetery. Another young fellow countryman joined [us] so that I was not completely alone. I had to wait in the office for a long time, until one led me to the door of a room in which on a tall block of ice my husband lay surrounded by religious Jews who were murmuring the prayers for the dead. Then I had to withdraw again. Soon a tarpaulin on poles was carried out on which lay the shrouded corpse, which was carried ahead of me. Coffins were unknown there. Suddenly the bearers placed the bier down and disappeared. We waited for a while, then my companions went to look for the men in order to find out why they had not returned. I stood alone beneath the grey February sky on the snow covered road and gazed at the shrouded body, the shape of which was outlined. I thought I could not bear it. Then it occurred to me that my husband had wished to be cremated to Beethoven’s Funeral March, so I sang it softly for him. The men came back and carried the bier to the grave. One was not permitted to reproach them for the delay. It had been too difficult to dig the deep grave out of the frozen earth. And then with gentle[21] movements they laid down the dead man who was dressed in a prayer shawl, uncovered his face and hands between which they put a small post with a little sign, which presumably bore his name. My heart wanted to stand still with the shock. But my husband’s face shone peacefully and beautifully towards me from the grave and my imagination lifted me out of the horror and let me see the royal grave of a pharaoh, in which I had to leave behind the person who had loved me like no other. After me no other woman was permitted to take part in the funeral ceremonies. The senior hospital doctor, who had grown up in western thinking and customs, was shocked when he heard that one had allowed me [to attend], and I had to admit that he was correct, that it was scarcely bearable for a woman. However I would not like to have been without the knowledge that I had led my husband to his final resting place. Three months later, when I was no longer an unknown woman, the Judenrat erected a headstone to my husband as thanks for my work with them, the first in the cemetery to bear German words. A member of the Judenrat led me to the unveiling, and my new-found kind Polish women friends completely covered the grave with flowers, contrary to the prevailing custom. The gratitude of these good people is just as boundless as their willingness to help. The Judenrat planned incidentally to inscribe on a large iron plaque the names of those buried in the Lublin cemetery. When I now left the cemetery, completely alone, and thought about how easy death from exposure[22] is, I was tempted for the first and only time. Nobody would notice if I now went out of the town and deeper and deeper into the snow. The thought of ending things was too appealing. My path led me past the hospital. There a man was standing in the entrance and gesticulating wildly with his arms. “Where have you been, one was looking for you, Do kimmen Leit” [possibly: You come and take charge]. And I went in. One needed me. One had missed me. My ego was and remained extinguished from that day on. That was the wonderful thing, that I could make myself useful, and in that way my inner being remained intact. Never have I loved my name more than when it now fell, in a comforted and grateful [tone], from the lips of those unfortunate distraught people who were transported to the hospital from the three villages where they had been allocated, and were waiting full of fear on their stretcher to be admitted. When they saw me, they immediately harboured the trust and hope, which was in no way justified, that they would now be safe. Indeed from the early days of our deportation I worked for the others. I began with the care of the sick. However soon the hospital administration asked me to take over the clerical work associated with the admission of the patients, as one could not understand each other well. Each day sledges came from the three villages in which our fellow countrymen were living and brought seriously and less seriously –ill patients, also [those] only mentally depressed, who hoped to find a [more] humane abode in the hospital than they had with the poor village Jews. Many crowded into the escort service despite the biting cold and the gruelling road in the understandable hope of receiving some solace and other forms of relief in the town. However, shocked by the atmosphere in Lublin which was loaded with agitation and without the desired possibility of being able to properly eat one’s fill once again (it was difficult for me to provide the frozen people merely with something warm to drink), they were happy to return to their peaceful villages. At the beginning the hospital admitted everyone, then however the administration refused to keep those who were not fully in need of hospital treatment, and it was often feverish, hungry people, poorly protected from the cold, [who] were sent back again on [a] 3 hour[23] journey by sledge. I wrestled with the admission administration over every single one. We felt the hardship of the rejection dreadfully. If however, as I did, [...] one took stock objectively of the situation that we were in at the hospital, really almost ruined, then one must admit that the administration could not behave otherwise. With time the conditions in the hospital improved so much that the physically sick were placed in the wards for the locals and in this way received another delay and nourishment, unlike those who had stayed behind in the general area for whom it was not ‘worth’ incurring special expense. One day the surgeon said to me that the American Red Cross had said they wanted to investigate the conditions in the hospital. He asked me to be in the hall when the visit took place, he wanted to introduce me so that I had the opportunity to say a few words about our situation. But the delegation came surrounded and encircled by such a large number of gold covered uniforms that it was impossible to get near them. It was also not necessary. The leading surgeon said without particular emphasis and therefore particularly effectively, “These people all have injuries from frostbite. Today I have amputated the 150th finger. Material for bandages is no longer available.” In addition the delegates saw the little girl who because of frostbite had had the fingers of her right hand and all of her toes amputated. The story of the little one is to have gone out that very same evening on the wireless. It was a case of a young school child who had been sent by her parents to attend school in the capital city of the province and had been deported from there with her foster mother. The visit had however had one success. After the child had been interrogated by the Gestapo on the following day, at which she is thought to have shown a defiant courage, the parents’ request was granted and permission given that when fit to travel she would be allowed to return to her parents. Probably she will have met together with them an even worse fate. In Lublin it [was what] lay ahead for the whole hospital. The deportees later ended up establishing sickbays in the 3 villages, in which they assembled those who had been rejected by the hospital and others who were not seriously ill. Doctors were certainly available who tenderly cared for them, even though medication was of course in short supply. The hospital pharmacy kindly assisted however despite some shortage of the most essential items. For nursing, more or less well-trained workers came forward. My sister, who at first had been requested by the Lublin hospital, later was in expert charge of a small sickbay like this and was very popular with the patients. Her rich experience from the war service now became completely invaluable. In yet another matter it was very difficult for me to defend the measures of the Judenrat. They took the view that the estate of a dead person, if there were no surviving spouse, was due to them to cover their expenses. They were however willing to waive [this], provided the proceeds of the items went not to an individual, but to the village group to which the deceased belonged. Initially there was no estate at all. All kinds of riffraff saw in the confusion the possibility of theft, in which a newly appointed guard unquestionably assisted. I have never again seen either my husband’s mink or his fur cap, even though he died in them and even though I was known in the hospital. One only handed over his wedding ring to me, which the doctor had sawn from his finger. That I myself had been robbed to such an extent was then however also the only thing that calmed my fellow countrymen, who angrily rebelled against the decision of the Judenrat. Meanwhile I had become the representative not only of the Judenrat but also of my fellow countrymen, who for a long time had been accustomed to me looking after their concerns. But I had not achieved this position of trust with the Judenrat as quickly. There was on the contrary opposition to overcome which had already started with the request for the provision of paper to use for the so urgently needed lists of people. Indeed we existed completely anonymously, and it was not possible at all for the Judenrat to respond to the enquiries from Germany about the whereabouts of individuals. That now became my work, beginning most primitively with the pencil found in my handbag and initially with the sacrifice of my own money for postage. Then however the Judenrat soon became accustomed to no longer reading through the incoming post but to handing it over to me to answer, so that my work was legitimized. When I later reminded the Generalsekretär [General Secretary] of the Judenrat who became my friend of this, my start, he did not want to believe his hostile behaviour. But even I was not objective when I took it on [about the fact] that one counted off to me the 25 sheets for the lists with hidden opposition; I did not yet suspect however at that time what treasure one sheet of writing paper represented. My experience gained in earlier work was based also on this: begin small, take the most insignificant work seriously, adopt the practices and change nothing until one has control of the situation and has earned trust. And I did not lack that for long here either, so that at the end of March one set up an office in which[24] from then on I advised the German speaking Jews, processed their emigration plans and found the various agencies as desired by the Judenrat, who did not want to attend to the affairs of the deportees for fear of the German authorities, in order to make the necessary assessments. In the hospital I was no longer needed since we had found a patroness in the person of the wife of the original chief physician who, like an angel, spent time with the patients and also possessed sufficient authority to secure facilities for the patients. Her husband was during the Polish War with his field hospital on the Hungarian border and was interned in Hungary. The villa in Lublin was immediately seized and the wife put out onto the street. As the doctor had a large mortgage on the hospital building, the wife was given a room there and granted board and lodging. She was a wonderful human being, withdrawn and brusque, [showed] towards me however a touching, inspired friendship. Unfortunately the Gestapo drove her out of the hospital because her concern for the deportees made them suspicious, especially as she had given up her room to me for consultations with my fellow countrymen so that I was not standing in the cold corridor. One could however not know whether plotters and freemasons took part in these meetings in her room. She was followed again and again and had in the end no space left for herself, but somewhere or other only merely a corner, until she was completely lost. She had a willingness to make sacrifices which bordered on self-abandonment. Her un-Polish mentality made her difficult for the Lubliners to comprehend; from this also resulted her fervent devotion to me as [a] representative of western culture. An additional duty in my office emerged, which was not always easy to tackle. At first my fellow countrymen came to the consultation in order to speak out, so Polish village residents soon also sought me out if they wanted to complain, rightly or wrongly, about my fellow countrymen, so that I therefore unwillingly became the arbiter. It must be stated again and again how willing the Polish Jews were to make sacrifices [when they] took us in. They shared their poverty with us, and they were terribly disappointed when parcels came from Germany and their guests did not consider it necessary to share with them, as they did very readily with their small amount. It can unfortunately not be concealed that some of our people did not behave well. They had no concept of the people’s poverty. Accustomed to an organisation arranging everything, they believed a failure of such a thing was to blame here, without knowing that our hosts had been completely unprepared and had received the uninvited guests [who had] been simply thrust on them without reward from any side. How could we know that sanitation, lavatories, running water in the house are unknown wonders, that the difficulty of fetching water encouraged lack of cleanliness, and that the form of nutrition is unimaginably poor, so that our demands were inevitably considered as presumption. And then it was also the case that the most demanding elements [were those] who at home had nothing themselves, and that the most modest and most grateful were those who simply possessed not only outwardly destructible, but also internal indestructible values. In any case the Polish people very soon discovered that their uninvited demanding guests were essentially German Jews who had always looked down their noses at the Polish Jews, and so in many cases tensions emerged which I tried to overcome. I began as of now to organise the three villages from my office. I gave out bulletins about everything generally accepted[25] that I established from the authorities, and former female colleagues were obliged by me to attend to the people in their groups and to help them with drawing up necessary petitions. I even took on the exchange of letters with the Berlin Zentrale and briefed them as thoroughly as I could about the situation. I was busy from early in the morning until evening and so exhausted when I came home, that I could fall asleep immediately on a chair or in bed, surrounded by many people talking. At home? Where was my home? Fate has decided about me quite particularly. I had nothing to do with [the way] everything happened differently from the other deportees. When I took my husband to the hospital, I asked where I could spend the night. One said to me that the only possibility was in the office at the orphanage, in which one would set up a bed. A friendly Polish woman led me there and the dear, kind, rather shy housemother kept me. A beautiful bedstead that a child gave up for me, freshly made beds; a towel, a small piece of soap which the children were over eager to bring to me. What riches! I needed to sleep perhaps for only just 2 weeks in my clothes, when I was given a gift of a nightdress, characteristically enough of the attitude of the kind giver, a good nightdress made of silk. On the second day a toothbrush was arranged with someone in the hospital and needle and thread in order to at least be able to pull together the big hole in my stockings. Enviable privilege! Never again can I now see a needle lying on the ground since I know what [a] priceless possession such an unremarkable thing represents. The business office even had a washbasin with running water, so that I could at last thoroughly wash myself, which drew my attention away from the fact that the room itself was very dirty, smoky and strewn with cigarette ends. In Poland one did not like to open the windows, in order to prevent the precious warmth from escaping. And in the room stood a big friendly tiled stove, which was indeed cold when I came in the evenings, however during the day had heated up somewhat, so that I did not freeze in bed after all and I could dry my only handkerchief on it. I had the good fortune of a home, where a sympathetic woman expected me, in which young girls gave me hot tea and were gladly willing to give up bread and fat from their small ration. However I needed to make use of it only in the mornings, as I had always taken a very good midday meal. Then oh miracle, I was invited to a meal each day by a doctor and his wife who had studied in Germany, lived in a modern district of town, ran a modern household and showed me a touching friendship. How wonderfully life plays out. This doctor’s wife, who later on was regarded in reports which came to me as anti-social, had been moved by the report which her husband brought from the hospital and had hurried with a large bag[26] of sweets to the patients, just as I arrived there with my husband. The odd couple attracted her attention, she tried to speak to me, but I had disappeared. So she came again the next day and invited me for a meal. I owe it to this woman that I was raised up from the mass and was moved into humane external conditions. Each day I came from then on to her and stayed as long as the curfew permitted. After my husband had died, she said, weeping, “Lean on us. As long as we have something, so do you.” Unfortunately I could not live with them as all available rooms had been confiscated. But one month later she had found accommodation for me in the neighbouring house with an Advokat [lawyer] and his wife, the most wonderful humanitarians that one could imagine. The young wife was beautiful physically and spiritually. She became like a daughter to me. She looked after me and spoiled me. “You do so much for others, let us do [something] for you.” In the bed made with the most beautiful linen I lay, lice-ridden, for despite bathing I was not rid of the vermin as I kept catching them in the office. However I was not only worried about bringing vermin into the beautiful clean home, but also spoiling the lovely blanket and linen with my ulcerating feet. Of course I too had not escaped physical injury. Right at the beginning I had caught a severe feverish bronchitis with a cough that lasted for a long time. But I could take no notice of that, for firstly in the orphanage I only had a place to sleep which I had to vacate at daybreak, and secondly I had to be in the hospital when the sledges came in from the surrounding area. My people, who, hungry and sleep-deprived, had undergone the hardship of the journey, had to find me to talk to me. When I collapsed one day unconscious in the corridor, one put me into bed. As however I had got up again during the day in order to be able to greet the people, one threw me out 2 days later. I was able to save the bed for my sister, whose general condition was much worse than mine. It was after all no great pleasure for me to be on the ward. There could be no thought of peaceful sleep. The Polish Jewess expresses her emotions loudly. She seems to consider stifling them [shows] a lack of feeling. And so one hears a constant more or less loud weeping over more or less great pain, which turns into a loud howl when the patient is taken to the operating theatre. Then I would much rather be in the place where I was sleeping, which I shared at the time with my sister who had been requested to go to Lublin, who for her part had a very much worse cough. If she were asleep,[27] then I would wake her with my coughing, and if I were asleep, she would stifle the cough which almost came like choking fits, and we both disturbed the poor, harassed, ever patient housemother, who for incomprehensible reasons did not want to have the door between us closed. Through the filthiness of my stockings which I could not change the scratched places on my leg became dangerously inflamed and finally ulcerated. My sister insisted that I had a dressing made by the nursing auxiliary in the hospital. As he however calmly thought that the places would dry out by themselves, I let the matter rest, however I knew how scarce dressings were. However then astonishingly I received without special request bandages sent from Germany. However the foot and leg remained swollen, so that almost until my departure, 5 months therefore, I could not wear any shoes. I wrapped the foot in newspaper and pulled a man’s rubber shoe over the top. This lady in fur coat and hat was certainly a grotesque sight, (already an unusual sight on the street among these people, for rich and poor wear headscarves) and my gammy leg in paper. Only when a doctor amongst my fellow countrymen started to work on my foot, which was already nearly infected with blood poisoning, was there an improvement. The concern of the doctor, that the elephantine swelling could indicate heart disease, found its simple solution through the realisation that the altered position of the foot through the lack of insole in the rubber shoe was the cause. But it is indicative of the absorption of working people that neither in the hospital nor in the doctor’s household did I find time to look after my health, and that it did not occur to anyone else to pay attention to it either. We were all engaged in tireless work for others, engrossed up to the ears in the tasks which were constantly piling up. The leading men of the Judenrat worked indescribably hard. I had scarcely ever met such personal sacrifice before, as I also now grasped the concept of real poverty. The Judenrat is an institution established by Pilsudski [a former Polish leader][28] which was retained under the invaders. It is a cumbersome instrument. In Lublin about 26 people belonged to it, as I recall, from whom a committee was appointed. At the head was an Advokat, a not very friendly, but clever and disciplined man, who was certainly very suited to the daily unpleasant negotiations with the Gestapo. But his commitment alone was not always enough. Sometimes one also took pleasure in ordering the entire Judenrat to an early morning meeting, and this in order to cause as much upheaval and agitation in the families as possible on the previous evening shortly before the curfew. Then one had the assembled company wait for a time outside in the cold in order to raise the tension, and finally gave information which the Präsident [president] could just as well have received alone. Thus e.g. the request to build a barracks without announcing a specific purpose, which opened the floodgates to wild rumours. Only after completion was the anxious tension lifted when the harmless purpose was revealed as the construction of workshops. Once, as I was told, all the members of the Gemeinde were also ordered to different squares where they had to wait bareheaded for a long time in the cold. Out of the crowd men with full beards were selected (one no longer found in Lublin as many men with religious styles of beard) and assembled in a certain square. There one demanded that they made a threatening sign. One showed them the stance. That was then photographed and appeared in journals with the subtitle, ‘Jews in Lublin threaten the police.’ The second Präsident, a kind engineer, already brought on his arrival an atmosphere of calm. He had the difficult task of procuring a workforce for the demands of the occupying authorities, which increased daily. Lublin has many qualified craftsmen with whose work the authorities were very satisfied. There was no remuneration. That, as with materials, accommodation etc, the Judenrat had to provide. Also for many private wishes of individuals, wishes which concerned for example baby clothes, a doll with eyes that shut and could say Papa and Mama, and such like items desired from the homeland. What made the work so difficult for the Judenrat was that no daily schedule could be arranged because new sudden demands were always being made. The gentlemen who did not belong to the committee appeared each day in the office with some concern or other of some friends and acquaintances or other, ‘Beziehung’ [connections] still played a large part in the minds of the Polish Jews, hampered the members of the committee who were overburdened without this with their suggestions and reproaches when a reported matter could not be resolved, and the room was buzzing with voices so that one could not understand how any work at all could be done amidst this. Often screaming women appeared in front of the house as soon as arrests had been made and demanded to know where the men had been taken, which one did not know in[29] the Judenrat either. The calming influence in the office was the well trained Generalsekretär, a clever level headed man, who knew the mentality of the Jews well. He understood best [how to] achieve calm to some extent and with his talent for organisation he knew [how to] convert the available rooms for the many new tasks. The Judenrat had to e.g. establish its own post room [...] as no Jew was still permitted to enter the post office. Each day an authorised Pole had to transport the post bags back and forth. Posters appeared on various houses in the ghetto quarter that at that time however was not a closed ghetto in the real sense, to which it was only downgraded years later. This was supposed to prevent the overwhelming of the small post office. Yes, the Herr Generalsekretär even managed to establish its own workroom for the harassed committee, in front of which an enormous Polish Jew stood guard. This Generalsekretär , who became my good friend, had an excellent understanding for the treatment of the populace. Thus many a riotous assembly in front of the Gemeindehaus [‘(Jewish) community house’][30] was dispersed through his calm, decisive manner.[31] Thus I remember one occasion which had assumed very threatening proportions. Yet again several hundred Jews had been arrested and taken away somewhere or other. The reason? One had become accustomed not to ask for reasons for arrests. But here it was exceptionally well known. A Volksdeutscher had been shot in a Polish inn. At this the quarter where the street was located was closed off and all the Polish and Polish Jewish residents brought out and taken away, during which the Jews had to go with their hands up to differentiate themselves from the Poles. It was explained to the Judenrat at its objection that no Jew had been present at the inn, “We already know that. But the house belongs to a Jew and some of the residents are Jewish.” In front of the Gemeindehaus many women had already gathered who were demanding, screaming, that the Judenrat start making enquiries. For most of the Jewish population the Judenrat still represented the omniscient authority. Suddenly the rumour spread that a messenger had brought news to the Judenrat. The gathering outside the Gemeindehaus became bigger and bigger, the behaviour of the women more and more threatening when one had them told that one could not yet give any information. Stones flew up against the windows and one announced that no member of the Judenrat would be allowed out of the door until clarification had been received. In fact a messenger had come from nearby Chelm, where the former Jewish lunatic asylum had been. When the SS [Schutzstaffel; ‘Defence or protection Squad; established 1923 as Hitler’s personal guard, later transformed by Heinrich Himmler into major paramilitary organisation of the Nazi Party’][32] however could use the house and land, the inmates were simply ‘liquidiert’ [liquidated], and Jews were brought in to improve the garden plot. The messenger had escaped, one had given him the list of names of the people taken there to bring with him, but in the agitation of the escape he had only brought one part of the list with him. The Judenrat realised that it was impossible for it to disclose the incomplete list, because the women would not believe that those not named were still alive. Then the Generalsekretär decided to tell a necessary lie. He possessed a schedule of the arrested men and he read this standing in front of the window. He had the anticipated success. The women went home. I was invited to a meal with this clever man every Saturday, much to the displeasure of my doctor’s wife who kept a jealous watch over my free time [which] belonged to her. But although I was very much indebted to her, for if she had not discovered me I would surely have had to leave Lublin after the death of my husband in order to return to the small village to which I had been assigned with my husband. Then my work for others in such a big way would never have been possible. However I was not yet willing to give up these meetings which for me were so interesting and informative. Through them I received even more insight into the Polish-Jewish conditions than through conversations with my two friends, the doctor and the Advokat, and the same was true of the Generalsekretär concerning a discussion with me, who had many years of organisational experiences in communal life and especially in social work. After the meal some Jews were always then present who wanted to talk to the ‘Deutsche’ [Germans]. The absolute trust which I had won from the Polish Jews showed itself in the way they used the Polish version of my name and no longer addressed me like other deported women. I could not have given them any greater pleasure than when I said my name e.g. on the telephone in this way. I belonged to them and they knew that they could depend on me. Amongst the constant visitors on these Saturday afternoons was also one Polish Jew, who during the First World War had lived and worked in Germany for some years as a prisoner of war. He felt like an expert witness and used to underline my remarks. On one occasion I spoke about the poor education of young people about cleanliness which I had observed in the orphanage. At this he said, “You must indeed know, in Germany cleanliness is a special matter. I lived with a Raebbe [rabbi] who had 5 children. They washed up to here!” He stood up and showed those present his upper body. “Up to here! None of us washes. I am no exception. The Judenrat does not wash either.” And when I broke out into loud laughter he added, somewhat embarrassed, “Perhaps the Doktor and the Advokat.” But fear of water affected not only the Jews. I was told by a craftswoman who had fled from Warsaw that she had spent the night in a village with an old Polish woman, who boasted that after holy baptism not a drop of water had touched her again. A tremendous respect filled me for the achievements of the men of the Judenrat, for whom every working day was full of new unforeseen ad hoc tasks, and who did not lose their calm demeanour. My good friend the Advokat who had chosen the supervision of the deportees and labour camps as his duties, died a short time after I left. His warm heart could not bear the mental torments in the long term. He never complained, only his wonderful young wife knew how he suffered. And his doctor. The latter said to me once that the Advokat, after he had had to let our troop move on from Lublin, had collapsed. He owned a big beautiful home, in the best part of town, but he lived with his wife and child in only one room. He had placed the other rooms at the disposal of acquaintances who had been bombed out. And finally in the former dining room that served as a common room, set up another bed for me. I did not know at all that I had disturbed this group through my arrival, as one considerately no longer used the room. I asked [them] to allow me to go to bed and to continue to use the room freely around me, as neither the coming and going nor the often lively discussion disturbed me in my exhausted sleep. In my former life I used to change a hotel room when the birds’ tweeting woke me up too early in the morning. Now the Polish chatter sounded like a lullaby to my ear. And how I had become accustomed in Germany to pay attention to every sound. A telephone ringing in the evening, a knock at the door, loud voices on the street, could set my heart racing. Here I had become completely impervious. There also lived in the house at that time a doctor’s widow, whose big corner house had been bombed down to the cellar, and who did not stop, despite the greatest financial damage, thinking of others. She even gave e.g. her wedding ring away to support the deportees, because she could not get to her bank account quickly enough. A brother lived with her. A former factory owner worth millions from Lodz, whose bed was a chest on which lay a mattress, and who had not left the home again since his escape because a German soldier had punched him on his first outing into Lublin. A craftswoman from Warsaw and a landowner’s wife from the border with Upper Silesia also lived there. It is only just by chance that our home was not hit and that we did not have to flee, said the lovely wife of the Advokat to me. So we decided to regard our home as no longer belonging only to us. Never has one allowed me to feel that I was a poor refugee and never was I conscious that I was poorer than the poorest beggar from whose figure, shrouded in rags, I shrank shuddering when I hurried through the beggars’ streets. And he was still richer than I, for he had a Fatherland, I however was a leaf blowing in the wind. The old ghetto quarter still existed, but no one was living there. 75% of the Jewish population used to live here, and the ever more numerous offices of the Judenrat were located in this part, the houses appeared mostly neglected. There was no sewerage system in this quarter of the town. Water was fetched from the well or brought by special carriers for payment. The lack of cleanliness was probably also caused by the arduous means of obtaining water and by the accumulation of people in the area, which made basic cleanliness difficult. Business premises were at that time, therefore some months after the defeat of Poland, already being taken away in increasing numbers from the Jews and afterwards newly modernised and given a grand opening with the Jews’ merchandise, but only for Reichs- and Volksdeutsche [Reichsdeutsche: ‘Germans of the Reich; Nazi term for ethnic Germans living in the German state following unification in 1871’],[33] as the sign proclaimed. The traders crouch on the dirty street and keep their wares in baskets, amongst which [is] even bread that is not bought without having been handled beforehand. The whole affair is scarcely no different at all from the customs of the East. The children hung around on the streets, seeing everything, hearing everything, knowing everything. The approach of the dreaded ‘Chapp’ (Fang) [capture] soldiers was broadcast by the children with telegraphic speed, so that all the men could promptly disappear into cellars and other hiding places before they were caught by the scouts. The children no longer had any school lessons or any apprenticeships. They loitered around on the streets until the curfew forced them into the dwellings. Whenever around this time coming from the hospital I hurried to the place where I was sleeping, I had the impression that rats were darting into their hiding places. Anyone who was not promptly off the streets could be prepared to be shot for this transgression. The curfew began during my time at 7 o’clock, was however with the approaching spring sadistically rescheduled for 6 o’clock. Patrols convinced each other that no Jew would presume to take[34] some air on the inner courtyard. A young girl who had allowed herself to stand at an open window at 8 o’clock promptly received a shot in the head. In the new quarter in which I later had the good fortune to live, the police regulations were indeed in force, but there were no raids and also no ban on leaving a light on after 7 o’clock. Yet solidarity demanded that one subjected oneself to the set of rules which were in force in the ghetto quarter. On one occasion I was walking behind a young Volksdeutscher who let his whip swing as he counted to 4. On 4 he lunged out with the whip and struck the passers-by coming towards him while laughing all over his face. It was however not only the black devil, the Volksdeutsche, whose hand was loose and who amused themselves by frightening the Jews. To my great astonishment there were also military personnel who behaved in a completely inappropriate way. For instance many a time a young officer drove in his Jagdwagen [light military jeep-like vehicle][35] through the main street, which separated the new from the old quarter of the town and led to the military practice ground. Always when he was almost in front of the house in which my office was situated he fired his revolver at the hands or feet of the innocent passers-by. I also had the opportunity to observe requisitioning soldiers. For instance I was just near my doctor friends’ when 2 soldiers of medium rank demanded entry. The household had already often been visited and the doctor had had all sorts of equipment taken away. One pushed me off into the kitchen with my fur coat so that I should be spared, and the doctor’s wife lay down in bed, into the silk cover of which her Persian lamb coat had been sewn. Through the door which was ajar I was able to observe the soldiers who were opening the doors of the sideboard and cupboard and taking out what they found in there. Only one set of cutlery was left behind for each person. Then they went, cursing over the bad experience, into the bedroom and tackled the linen cupboard, whilst the woman of the house tried in a hysterically agitated fashion to make clear to them how often she had already been visited and produced receipts which had been issued each time. Come off it, stop pretending. You are not sick, I have just seen you from the hallway, said one of the soldiers in a harsh tone. I had come to the front by then in order to support the woman. No, it was I whom you saw, I said calmly. At the sound of the German words the soldier turned round, astonished. Do not be afraid, I said to the weeping woman, a German soldier would not harm a woman. That was perhaps not very diplomatic of me at all, but I still really believed at that time in discipline and order in the German army. The soldier called his comrades back from the linen cupboard. Leave that alone, he muttered. And turned to me, that is just because people always lie to us, so we have to check. Also the bedside tables, he continued in a sterner tone, they are luxury items and remain our property until we come for them. The German soldiers made good use of those kinds of luxury items, for increasingly their or other women followed them, with whom they wanted to make their life in dirty Lublin more pleasant. He gave a ‘receipt’ with a flourish and the two skedaddled. And the visit of the looters did not always pass off as peacefully. In the small Jewish village in which our old people lived, and which in general was spared such disturbances of the peace during my time, two soldiers broke into the room of a lodging and stole the furs of the old married couple. As they put up a fight, they were horribly beaten. The old man, who like me was still so naive as to believe in justice, came to the military authorities in Lublin. One informed him that one deplored such an offence, even when it was perpetrated against Jews, however that one could not find the guilty parties without further details of their regiment. And the old people were not in a position to provide these. Perhaps the military authorities were even often inclined to punish injustice, as the following example shows: By a certain date the good Polish banknotes had to be exchanged into new Generalgouvernement [General Government: ‘German-occupied central Poland’][36] banknotes. In order to prevent a mass exodus from the surrounding villages, one representative at a time was always sent with the village’s assets. A beautiful corrupt Jewess, whose gentleman friend was a Gendarmeriewachtmeister [officer in the rural police],[37] had found out when the representative would come from her village. The Wachtmeister [officer] decided to take the gold away from the man and promised the husband of his beautiful lady friend a 25% share if he helped him in this undertaking. The plan succeeded, but the Wachtmeister was caught, demoted in front of his assembled comrades and imprisoned. The affair had however one more consequence. The Gestapo gave the Judenrat an ultimatum, to produce within 3 days [either] the Jew or the missing money. The Jew could not be found. The missing 25,000 Zloty had to be paid by the Judenrat. There remained, despite an appeal being lodged, nothing to do other than to raise the money by an urgent levy, ---however the damaged village never received the money. The common soldier had grown accustomed to being greeted most humbly by Jews. Presumably the rule was to greet higher ranks. But the most humble and tormented people did not differentiate and greeted the military dress in all cases. If one looked at the streets through which a group of a hundred were marching, then one would notice the waving of the caps, as if a gust of wind were blowing over the heads. I was once walking towards a platoon and saw the way the soldiers’ eyes roamed to right and left in order to establish whether the now accustomed greeting was coming. And to my amazement I twice saw soldiers leap out of the platoon onto the pavement and punch Jews who had not torn the cap quickly enough from their head. I also saw however higher ranked officers thank the Jews politely for the greeting. I experienced a short interlude with one private soldier that shows that not quite all are infected, and that probably, if they do not want to strut about in a mass with their brutality, they have retained a civilised behaviour. I arrived too early one day at an authority and sat down because of my bad foot on a bench near the guard. After some time of covert observation the soldier came up to me. But you are not from around here either, he began the conversation. I find it quite dreadful here, everything is so dirty. Where do you come from then? I asked back. From Hamburg. From beautiful Hamburg I replied to his joy, and we conversed about the city. But why are you here anyway? he interrupted suddenly. I pointed silently to my armband. (We received immediately in Lublin an armband with the Star of David and the people, who like me were occupied in relief work, had another overprint stamped on by the Gestapo which protected them from being claimed for other work by the occupying authorities). The sign had escaped him until now. Oh dear, you are perhaps a Jewess? But that is bad, he said in a sympathetic tone. I was convinced that the desire for further discussion had deserted him, all the more as meanwhile the Polish public had gathered. But he came up again and again in order to speak to me of his native city. And when he was relieved, I heard the way he commended me to the young soldier who also immediately looked after me. One day there was a new phenomenon on the street scene. SA men stood at various road junctions with a beautiful breast plate on which could be read, ‘Verkehrspolizei’ [traffic police]. However the Poles could not read that and as a result there were many unpleasant interludes to which I was also a witness. I saw one old Pole unsuspectingly walk diagonally across the road, where a Verkehrspolizist [traffic officer] greeted him with such a powerful punch that the old man fell to the ground. When he had laboriously righted himself, a second blow greeted him. He staggered, fell down, tried to get up. A third blow from the hand of the calmly waiting SA man, so that the old man remained lying in the dirty gutter. And I continued on my way on the other side of the street.---- And not only I. It was impossible to help. I did not want to believe the assertions of my friends that Lublin could ever be in a clean condition. Passing the streets in the old quarter was already a problem in winter, in spring an art. One jumped over holes and splashed around unconcerned in the standing water, dirtying oneself or others. One also became impervious to it. One day I lay in the water, a little unconscious from being chucked out of a farm wagon with which the Raebbe [rabbi] from Glusk had had me collected so that I could support his concerns before the Judenrat about the delivery of flour. The wagon overturned on its journey through mountain and valley and I was hurled against the wall of a house. When I came to, I saw a crowd of gesticulating Jews standing around me. The Raebbe[38] kept at a respectful distance and the carter was only interested in righting his wagon again. This small accident did however have the favourable outcome that the Judenrat really did allow flour to be wrested from it, although nothing had yet arrived from the Joint for the deportees. The sight of the woman, dirty and wet from head to toe, who demanded compensation for her concussion in the form of the requested foodstuff, was effective in convincing them. I have not experienced any bad treatment from the authorities. Only the beginning at the passport office[39] was difficult. The young agent was probably somewhat insecure, for later he behaved quite differently. Polish Jews were not permitted to emigrate, he explained to me harshly at my enquiry about the necessary formalities. We are not Polish, but German Jews, to whom therefore this rule does not apply. There are no German Jews. Well, then we are Jews from Germany. I will not discuss this question with you, he replied rudely. I summoned all my courage for a safer approach and countered firmly: But you will surely be so kind as to inform me which formalities are necessary for the acquisition of a passport. I have to advise my fellow countrymen about them who have an opportunity to emigrate. He explained to me grumpily that in March no applications would be processed, however then reluctantly revealed the usual channels to me, so that all of us who had our entry permits could submit our applications by 1st April. At this time the head of the passport office was back from holiday, a young official who took the trouble to be objective and who quickly became accustomed to talk through with me all the matters to do with the Jews who were able to emigrate. And yet it is the former, at that time so unkind official, who had later decisively influenced me in my own case. That I alone had received the permit from the Gestapo to emigrate seems like a miracle, and I recognised only with hindsight the bureaucratic oversight that emanated from a quite peculiar coincidence. I was among the first four who could apply for the emigration permit, because the entry permit for a foreign country had arrived. Soon therefore[40] I received a summons to the Gestapo. Not a pleasant procedure, my whole neighbourhood was afraid, and many offered to accompany me. I feigned complete equanimity, however I certainly did not feel happy as I hobbled to the building located on the outskirts of the city. There is no tramway in Lublin. Everyone uses the Chaises [a type of carriage] which probably date from the time of Anna Karenina, which are pulled by the thin little horses, urged on with shouts, over mountain and valley of the bad cobbles. But I had no money for that. It would also have been bizarre if a deported Jewess who had lost everything had driven up to the Gestapo. Very tired and inwardly concerned, I arrived. In front of the door a young Volksdeutscher stood guard, who turned me away with his bayonet despite the summons being produced. But I still had to speak with the head of the passport office[41] about a South African case. So I made a detour and during the discussion I constantly shirked the question whether I should tell the official about my summons to the Gestapo and in this way perhaps upset the only recently gained mutual trust. Then I said to him however at the conclusion that presumably because of my own application, about which I had never spoken to him, I had received a summons to the Gestapo, but had not been allowed in. “What the devil was he thinking of!” “One must allow you in, go straight back!” I took refuge behind my painful foot, for I thought that the following day another guard would treat me much better. You cannot allow such a thing to happen to you, he added. Now I was immediately determined to try once again, and with a more confident attitude I went past the young man dressed in black so that he could in no way stop me. Behind the door another man dressed in black. I produced[42] my summons. Guardhouse, he shouted at me. I went to the guardhouse, above the entrance to which was written in large letters, ‘Juden ist der Eintritt verboten’ [Entry is forbidden to Jews], showed my summons again and was given a young man dressed in black as escort, for in the Gestapo building one is not permitted to move around alone. As he could not read however, something I did not know, he could not even find the room and ran with me up and down the stairs. Eventually he told me to wait and went up to two SS officers who were standing at the end of the corridor. I cannot watch the woman, he announced in halting German, saluting according to the rules. What does that mean, one of the officers barked at him and took the summons from his hand. Aha, Elsa, Sara, he said in a contemptuous tone, turned towards me; I looked towards him with [an] outwardly calm demeanour. He gave the boy a shove. I will take the lady myself, he said, to my not inconsiderable surprise. The lady? Was I still a lady? But I was a Jewess! He came up to me and I followed him in silence. He tore open the door to a room and said to the secretary who jumped up respectfully: The lady wishes to speak to you. This introduction had clearly taken the man by surprise and given me back the inner confidence. I showed my summons and asked what one wanted of me. You wish to have an emigration permit and do not even state your date of birth. Oh, I am an idiot, I cried relieved, such a thing should not happen to me! The answer clearly amused him. I will immediately complete[43] the permit for you and send it to the passport office, he said laughing, and so all further steps were taken for this valuable document. No one else had received their permit from the Gestapo. A prohibition was issued against emigration for deportees, which we had not anticipated. The different authorities continued to attend to the processing of the permits and allowed themselves to pay higher and higher fees, which were only affordable because in the hope of emigrating soon everything expendable was sold. Then at first everyone in the same position as I derived from the approval given to me the treacherous hope that the door would be opened. When after waiting for months I actually did receive the passport, one allowed me to have the certain feeling that I was only the start. But after a long time, a wait of almost a year, one finally received the clear decision that an emigration from Poland would not be permitted. That was a great blow for those it concerned who had entry permits to various countries in their pocket, and a shadow never to be lifted over the happiness of the only one to be saved, when she thought of the bitterness which must fill those who were disappointed. Unquestionably they were forced to assume that I had only looked after myself, while in fact I only owed this wonderful act of providence to the chain of strange circumstances. However it took another 4 months until for me all the formalities had been completed. Although we had not received more than 10 Marks and had lost all our assets, we needed however for onward migration the consent of the Finanzamt [tax office][44] and the Devisenstelle [foreign currency office].[45] In an initial consultation which I had in March with the head of the Finanzamt I was able to establish that one had there not the slightest idea of what had happened to us. One was inclined to arrange the certificate free of charge when I reported the circumstances. Later however one demanded 10 Zloty for it, and when I questioned this on behalf of a woman and asked how she was supposed to pay it, the official retorted to me, “There are no poor Jews.” I explained the situation to him and he asked, “What are the people living on then?” I responded, “On the charity of the poor Jews who share what little they have with them.” “There are no poor Polish Jews,” he repeated grumpily. At the Devisenstelle the administration was in the hands of a former officer who was able to hide his true feelings under a brusque exterior. “Couldn’t you get the Jews to write their submissions sensibly, so that one can make comments round the edge? I have not had such a sensible document as yours in my hand for a long time. My fellow countrymen understand, as do I, how to make a submission, and I will get those present to do it. I do have an office here for this, but I hope there will soon be an answer. It is not because of us, the processing takes place in Krakow and they do not rush Judensschen [Jews] through. I have often had to have consultations with the man and felt that he took the trouble to help. At that he went to work very carefully, so as not to betray the interest in Jewish matters. From time to time he also telephoned Krakow about Jewish cases. They must have paid for the discussion as, you see, one cannot use a state administration for Jews. On one occasion I happened to be in the room when he was having just such a discussion. He asked about the various applications and said at the end, “And so there is the matter anyway. Please be so good as to free me at last from the Jew, he is running into my house.” With that he believed he had spoken sufficiently to the mouth of the senior authorities, and that he had set in motion the matter of the Jews. The discussion about my own case ended in a very dramatic way. I had never asked him about it, although during each conversation I had the secret hope to be next too one day. My submission had been made 3 months before, when the young Polish secretary, who had definitely not been appointed by the Nazis, said to me that an answer had arrived. Outwardly calm as ever, inwardly stretched to breaking point, I let the conversation wash over me. At the end he said gruffly, “Today a large pile of permits arrived. The matter now appears to be moving forward.” And he read out to me a list of unknown Polish names. I plucked up courage. How is my case going for that matter? Also permitted. Costs 300 Zloty. Has the sum been demanded of everyone, I asked in horror. No, only from the Jews from Germany. Why, I asked incensed, why does one demand that from us, after one has deprived us of all our assets? Why are we being treated differently? Because one has had such bad experiences with the Jews, came the reply. Now for the first time my composure deserted me. How can one generalize like that? Everywhere there are good and bad elements. Why should only the Jews be [a] perfect angel! Have the Jews not served and made sacrifices for the Fatherland just as much as the other fellow citizens? I know nothing about that. Well then, take our family as an example. Both brothers fought in the War. My sister was a sister with the Red Cross. I had a leading position in the Nationaler Frauendienst [National Women’s Service: a voluntary relief service].[46] All four of us have war decorations. Why have you not cited that in your submission? he shouted at me. How is one supposed to know that? Why should I mention something obvious? For us service to the Fatherland was just as obvious as for you, I said proudly. Provoked he banged on the table. [It is a] disgrace, [a] disgrace, he shouted. I did say it straight away when the office was so pleased about the permit. The woman has not got the money. We are not [like] that at all, he added, we old officers. But there sits in Krakow such a callow bunch that they could not put anywhere else, and they cause trouble. I cannot sell my wedding ring, I said. That is the only thing of value that I am allowed to keep. But then one will say again, one sees that the Jews have money, and will demand even more from the next ones. Many do not even still have their wedding ring. They have sold them in order to satisfy their hunger. No, I cannot do anything with the permit and will remain here. I went home very gloomily. For the first time I was unsure how I should react. I asked my friends for advice. Do everything to get away, they said. It is also important for us that outside someone is alive who can testify that it is worthwhile doing something for the Polish Jews. One day later a very grave warning and urging came from my friends in Stockholm, as the entry permit was expiring. That gave me the push that I needed. I had [things] to do at the passport office[47] and met there the young official who had made my debut so much harder. I need your advice today for myself for once, I said. I could meet the demand of the Devisenstelle from the proceeds of the sale of my wedding ring. But will I also really receive the passport? We have been informed that your case is in order. One is just not clear about what sort of passport one should give you and will place obstacles in your way to the last. But if you can get hold of the money, then do not let yourself be intimidated. And I followed his advice. I could of course have obtained the necessary money from my Polish friends, but it went against the grain to approach them about it. I knew how hard the constraint of their monthly cash withdrawal was, and it seemed to me sacrifice enough that one had entirely fed me. The handing over of the passport was still delayed for a long time, although one had said to the representative of the Krakow Judenrat, who had had a general consultation with the Referent [adviser] about Jewish emigration, that my case was now in order and the other cases would follow. But no one else came afterwards, although the ever increasing fees had been paid at great sacrifice. The passport, which I then finally received, was a Polish form, stamped at the bottom: Generalgouvernement, valid for 4 weeks, of which 2 had already elapsed. When I wanted to reject the passport the official said to me: “Do not complicate the matter. You will certainly be able to sort that out easily in Stockholm.” And so I prepared for departure. I had still been visiting at least 2 groups during the last weeks. The representative of the Joint took me with him, and in this way I got to know the place where the greatest number of my fellow countrymen were staying, Piaski. I was pleased to see my uncle and aunt again, who had developed such beneficial work in the small town. The two had always been philanthropists in the greatest way, and the initial reticence of our fellow countrymen towards this married couple, who they no longer considered belonged to them on sectarian grounds, had indeed soon yielded to the greatest veneration, of which my uncle, for his 70th birthday which he celebrated during the deportation, received touching evidence. However on the very day of my unforeseeable arrival both had decided to go to Lublin to arrange for their passports. We comrades met on the country road. We could only reach out our hand to each other on parting[48] forever. My relatives were transported onward with all the fellow countrymen after I had left, and all the investigations into their whereabouts were fruitless. My sister was also torn away from her work and shared their fate. Unfortunately I could no longer visit Belzyce where my brother played a leading role. But I spoke to him often whenever he came to Lublin as the representative of the matters in his village, when he lent his support to the local people and to the deportees alike. I was pleased that my friends received him hospitably, so that after all the primitiveness and austerity in his incredibly busy daily life he could spend a few pleasant hours in the evening in decent surroundings. Even after my departure these good people continued to be a support for him, until they too were driven out of their homes. I later received news of my brother’s death and without knowing the circumstances I know that he did not die a natural death. A victim of his devotion to duty was said in the short message from a woman friend who was able to write to my relatives in Germany. A leadership had immediately crystallised in each village, and it was interesting to observe how differently the groups developed by reason of the leading personalities. In the largest group, Piaski,[49] the leader was our former Gemeindevorsteher [‘(Jewish) community chairman and/or council member’],[50] a man of the most honourable reputation but too distant and grand to be able to make a real connection with the Polish Jews. He was still very much accepted by our people who yielded to his authority. And yet the lack of understanding towards the mentality of the residents of the village remained a shortcoming of the group that made itself felt. In this group were the most capable women of the Gemeinde, but the Vorsteher disapproved of women’s work, and only after months was convinced that the women were indeed more than useful for the work. In the second largest group a triumvirate had been established, consisting of my brother, a doctor and a man who until now had only appeared to be an unproductive critic, but now revealed an astonishing talent for organisation. He wore himself out completely on the opposition, for he possessed at first, as an as yet unknown, no authority. Whenever he could not manage the people he called my brother to help, and he often told me how the latter again and again saved the situation with a witticism. My brother was a born parliamentarian, albeit definitely not the compromiser like his sister. What he thought was right, he carried through; he had from his work as Father’s successor as chairman of the Buchdruckereibesitzverband [association of owners of publishing firms] experience of dealing with disputing parties, particularly of collective bargaining, which now stood him in good stead. He countered Yiddish with Plattdeutsch [Low German], (he was a great admirer of Reuter [19th century author from Stavenhagen who wrote in Low German][51] which led to the most hilarious scenes). Although he had been considered by my fellow countrymen initially as a renegade, his complete impartiality, his devoted efforts to help everybody, even the Polish Jews who turned to him and made him an arbitrator, his unbending courage helped to provide him with a unique position of trust. He was probably chosen by the authorities as a former Offiziersstellvertreter [Offizier-Stellvertreter; deputy officer; junior officer in the German army][52] for the unpleasant duty of the Ordnungsdienst [Order Service: Jewish police][53] and had also at that time the employment office, not very enjoyable work, which took him in wind and [all] weather in his poor clothing to checkpoints on the country road. But even before the work was decreed at the same time,[54] he had organised one such [work] himself for mental strengthening; he realised immediately, that [...] hanging around and gossiping in the alleyways posed a great danger to the conduct of the deportees. He had the Marktplatz [market place] paved, in the vicinity of the Versammlungsraum [assembly room] lavatories were even built, something that the two other groups then also took up with the result that the locals did everything to dirty and destroy this ‘unnötige Einrichtung’ [unnecessary facility]. He had the part of the cemetery where our fellow countrymen had been laid to rest beautifully renovated, had a barracks erected as accommodation for the sick and arranged for plants to be grown all around. The women’s work was also divided into kitchen, hospital, office work and the like. But he also tried to preserve a cultural life amongst these primitive people and conditions that were challenged from outside. He applied himself quite particularly to the young people. Despite the official prohibition he succeeded in bringing about a kind of schooling and Piaski, with its trained teachers, soon ventured to follow the example. Birthdays, blessings became communal experiences for which he not only assisted in conjuring up gifts, but also in creating a festive atmosphere. He was the chosen speaker who could give people in a pithy, cheerful speech [...], yet shot through with seriousness, an uplifting view. In his small partitioned area, which had been awarded to him as his own living area as a privilege for his leading position, friends gathered in the evenings whenever duty did not call him away. But he adhered quite particularly to his youth evenings, which proved so popular that they burst [out of] the room. He planted in the young people the strength for courageous endurance,[55] of which he himself was a model. In little Glusk there stood at the forefront an exceptionally capable and adaptable man of over 70 years who had understood how to establish the best relationship with the poor locals and the somewhat peculiar rabbi. The organisational talent of the German Jews soon bore fruit. One built wooden frames everywhere for the missing sleeping accommodation, one established central kitchens in all the groups, and sickbays were established for those turned away from the hospital in all 3 villages and attended by our capable doctors who had come too. My sister who was suffering very much herself worked tirelessly at the various places to which one called her. The Jewish population had initially approached the deportees with [an] endless readiness to help. However through the apparently boundless demands of the uninvited guests about their conditions, through the later realisation that these were really the same German Jews who had always shown very little understanding to the Polish Jews, and through the prospect of not being rid of the burden in human and economic terms again very soon, tensions quickly emerged which were often discharged in an unpleasant way and in which both sides were at fault. Many a time cases of dispute were brought to me, where I could understand the difficulty of living in close proximity with completely different people clearly enough. For the Jewish population of Poland had little affinity[56] with their fellow Jews from the west, who had not met oppression and defamation for generations and as a result had been able to develop quite differently. One has to have had [the] opportunity to observe, not only the Polish Jews themselves but also their environment, in order to understand how this mentality had developed.[57] In my farewell letter to the fellow countrymen I asked them most emphatically not to forget how much gratitude we[58] owed to the Polish Jews. Only when I had acquired some distance from the conditions and in Stockholm had read much about Polish-Jewish life, the realisation came to me that nothing had been asked by them of us, whom the poor Jews in Poland [had] not wanted and were forced to bear. But for us that meant a descent onto the lowest step of culture, onto which we were forced but were not willing to endure. And yet everything that I can bear witness to from the conditions at that time, and that had been difficult enough to experience, seems to me merely a dress rehearsal for the tragedies of the following deportations. It moved me deeply to read in the letters from my brother how very much he and the others had tried to ease for the later deportees the arrival into the terrible conditions. How they, who had to dwell in such cramped quarters and knew how overcrowding makes unharmonious factors more difficult for the oppressed people, crowded together even more in order to help the ‘Neue’ [new people]. But how they also admired the newcomers, who came in clean clothes, whilst our people had already become accustomed to the tattered exterior. “The village has acquired a completely different appearance,” wrote my brother. For although the Reichsvertretung had paid 50,000 Reichsmarks to the Gestapo in order to release our clothing which had been left behind, after a long wait only a little had arrived and this small amount also indicated an unfavourable earlier exchange. The things which our suitcases contained, which we had brought with us to Lublin and left behind on the station platform, we did not see again. But I have learned from an authentic source[59] that they were situated, well sorted-through in Gestapo locations, furnished with the label of the current owner who will have sent them securely back to his loved ones at home. One has often asked me how the life of the deportees developed. If I answer that, then I must always make the qualification that I can only judge the early beginnings of a deportation. Apparently the Herr Gauleiter had gone to work on us so quickly that the plans had not been completely worked out. But already during the 5 months of which I am giving a report, conditions had gradually worsened. One was also perhaps waiting for the echo which the first actions would find in the world, and when this did not come, one proceeded resourcefully further along the road. My fellow countrymen were later spared nothing of all the horror about which news then trickled out. However at first the deportees had in their small villages complete freedom of movement. One went walking unimpeded along the village street, glad to be able to escape from the dreadful constraints of the space and never being alone. One was as a city dweller of course unhappy, having to spend the day without any stimulus. Gathering in the communal area to play cards and talk offered the only diversion. But almost everyone carried the class distinctions from the ‘frühere Welt’ [old world] with him. In Piaski our Kantor [cantor] had mustered a mixed choir which gave great pleasure. In Glusk the old people had established an afternoon for presentations of former great spiritual pleasures. “Do not let us also starve spiritually,” one old lady wrote to me and in this way gave me the impetus for a book collection. One cannot sufficiently admire the mental strength which, under such difficult, adverse and frightening external conditions, did have an impact on the surroundings. Especially on the young. For instance e.g. an active young man in Piaski had managed to obtain from a farmer a small piece of land that he was now cultivating with the children. There was no lack of young spectators from the village who made fun, particularly of the fetching of water. “Why are you fetching water? It will rain soon. Why are you planting tomatoes, one buys them.” But one day the young instigator of the garden discovered a group of young Polish Jews who were digging a piece of land. “What are you doing here then,” he asked. “What the Deitschen [Deutschen: Germans] can do, we can do too,” was the reply. The examples multiplied. With deep concern I saw these youths running wild who well deserved to be saved. My aunt, a very motherly woman, took an interest particularly in confinements and new-borns. I received horrified descriptions about the conditions, which even the newly qualified country midwife could not overcome. The women held onto old customs and prejudices and were hard to influence. Here and there my forceful aunt managed to achieve small successes, mostly through bribery in the form of baby clothes and the like as [a] reward,[60] in which our friends in Germany were instrumental, for at that time one could still send unlimited parcels which arrived in increasing numbers. The group leaders imposed a small levy on the recipients in order to be able to do the same for those who had neither relatives nor friends at home. I myself became occasionally overwhelmed with parcels of the most beautiful contents. I was a very well-known name through my former activities and so much of the involvement concentrated on me. Whenever I came home in the evenings the small daughter of the Advokat greeted me with the words, “Tante, lots of parcels.” And she enthusiastically assisted me with the unpacking, during which now and again some unknown treat or other would also fall out, and helped repack for the groups to which I joyfully sent my bounty. I was particularly delighted about the understanding about sending medicines and bandages which our sickbays urgently needed. But I placed the representatives in the groups in a difficult position, as the consignments were not enough for everyone by far and did not have equivalent contents. The people are always very quick to believe in preferential treatment and now these poor deprived people, for whom the smallest trifle turned into a priceless asset. Now I became acquainted with the revaluation of all values in the truest sense of the word. The only way was to let fate decide, in order to control the dissatisfaction. How horrified I was later to learn that frequently the items gained in this way were sold. Until it became clear to me that I represented the ethics of the full stomach. For those who were starving it was indeed most important to satisfy the stomach. Much has changed in the meantime in the deportation. Everything is relative. The inadequate accommodation in the dwellings of the poor Polish Jews must, [compared] to that which later had to serve the deportees as lodging, still be called bearable. For our people it was dreadful enough. This overcrowding in the narrow, dirty space, sleeping on chairs, tables, on a dirty floor, rarely in a bed and then not as the sole occupant, one washbasin for everyone that at night had to serve yet other purposes, what torture that was! Added to that the inadequate food, which was only improved a little by the subsidy from the Joint, which considering the demands which were growing to monstrous proportions only amounted to a drop and completely petered out when no more funds could come from America. If during the first weeks the occupation of the deportees depended on the ingenuity of the leadership, then it soon completely changed. First of all came the requisition of the younger workforce. The people would have been quite content to stop loitering around if the attendant circumstances had not been so terrifying. There came e.g. lorries into the village driven by an SS squad, who demanded a line-up of residents and deportees of a certain age. Such a line-up cleverly did not happen to the Polish Jews, but however to the decent Germans. In addition it was as if the Poles had disappeared off the face of the Earth. Therefore one made up the necessary number with elderly deported men. Our people are loaded onto the lorries and drive into the unknown, leaving women and children behind, distraught. In Lublin, which was informed by telephone (at that time one was still permitted to telephone from the small villages), it was then possible to track the men down to transit camps in order to provide them with food and to let the family have news. During my time the men were required for works on the Bug and Vistula. When they arrived at their places of work they discovered no accommodation areas and had to spend the night in the open air until such time as they had constructed the barracks themselves. Later those deployed to work were prepared somewhat more systematically and received expert supervision from our ranks. The Judenrat had to pay for all the expenses, purchase all the material and supply the provisions. As for the latter the standards of the Polish Jews applied, thus they were not adequate for our needs in either the quality or the quantity. When later the deployment for the harvesting of the rich crop came, also workers for office and factory work in Lublin were required, probably in order to release the Reichsdeutsche for military service, there was a decent reward and rations from the employers. One has often put the question to me whether anybody had thoughts of escaping, and whether one had sabotaged the work. I was very surprised by this question. No one had thought of deliberately performing work badly. No one had thought of escape, as I believe I can claim. I later occupied myself greatly with the psychological background to our behaviour, after I saw the reaction of other peoples. I believe we were driven by two motives. Firstly, we were convinced that it could only be a case of a temporary stay in the deportation. The same lack of comprehension in respect of the actual circumstances, which had prevented so many of us from emigrating early enough, because we did not know the political situation. And secondly we came from the bourgeois-democratic sphere which does not start revolutions but believes in the legal change of government. And that the German Volk [people], amongst whom we had been living so assimilated and possessed many good friends, would not tolerate the dictatorship for long, seemed obvious to us, who allowed our eyes to be shielded with blinkers from our democratic ideals. Many a one of us had learned to think historically. The awareness, that always during great political upheavals people were banished from their Fatherland, who later would be brought back and recognised as the most faithful sons, seemed [a] comfort and source of strength. I must honestly say, like that Polish Jew, “I am no exception.” The road to freedom Nobody in the Judenrat had believed that the passport would be received. When I spoke to the Präsident [president] about allowing a successor from among the deportees to become acquainted with the work as a precautionary measure, who however, in the absence of such a friendly intake as I found [them] at their best, would have to receive a small fee,[61] he laughed at me. “When you have the passport in your hands, we will talk about it further.” But when I did have the passport in my hands, I did not want to talk any more, but to leave at once. However I was able to have a clear conscience, having secretly prepared a successor in the person of the former head of the Palästinaamt [‘Palestine office; ...setup... to handle the organisation, regulation and implementation of Jewish immigration to Palestine’],[62] who from time to time came to Lublin to visit his sick daughter, and then used the opportunity to learn from me. This very suitable successor, who had the necessary empathy with the Polish mentality and was also valued by my fellow countrymen, unfortunately only held office for a short time because he fell victim to epidemic typhus. The Judenrat was very excited about the fact that someone from Poland would be released and so would be able to establish contact with the outside world. They really wanted to give me a farewell party, but I asked to be allowed to depart immediately. It was quite strange that I, who had been able to await the outcome so calmly and had come to terms with the thought of not giving up my work, now was gripped by a psychosis and would have preferred to avail myself of the next train. But I had to state that I also agreed to join in a farewell session of the Judenrat. My sister had, as if driven by a premonition, come to Lublin early in the morning and took part in the moving event. The splendid Dezernent für Wohlfahrtsfragen [department head for welfare questions], with whom I had had the most to do, gave the farewell speech in perfect German. I was able to thank [him], from a deeply moved heart, now with the words of Hans Sachs, “Euch macht’s leicht, mir macht’s Ihr schwer, gebt ihr mir Armen zu viel Ehr.” [63] [You make it easy for yourself, you make it difficult for me, you do me, a poor man, too much honour. (Attempt to quote the character Hans Sachs in Wagner’s opera, Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg).]. Truly, the gratitude of these good people, for showing them understanding and standing side by side with them when help is needed, is indescribable. Their farewell cries, “Do not forget us, help us!” are deeply embedded in my heart. Like the dove from Noah’s ark, I was set free. But oh, I found no country for the poorest that I had to leave behind with sadness and concern. Immediately after my arrival in Stockholm I did make contact with the Joint in the U.S.A. in order to make the donations flow again. But it was only possible to dispatch from there for a short time and not sufficient resources by far. In addition a big relief operation was required, which I endeavoured again and again to instigate. With the entry of America into the war the transfers were soon made impossible anyway. For my fellow countrymen I organised fundraising with the help of my friends in Stockholm which, in accordance with their private nature and my unfamiliarity and uncertainty on foreign soil had been, more through the others than through me, quite successful, which however could of course not remotely satisfy the great need for help. And again I laid myself open to the accusation of only helping some and not all. For still one saw in me the person who had cared for all equally. For all [my] efforts not only the deportees still stood before my eyes however, but the entire unfortunate Polish Jewry. It has taken a long time before my spirit could overcome the depression about this failure of my mission. I had the shameful feeling of having no entitlement to a life in peace and freedom, when I had to disappoint the hope of so many unfortunate people. In the car, which the Judenrat provided, laden with flowers, so that I could not hold them in my arm, I drove in the brightest sunshine back down the road to the railway station, which once my poor husband had had to walk along in stockinged feet. Everything was so unreal, so incredible, like a dream. At the station the dear wife of the Advokat said goodbye to me, as she was not permitted to go onto the platform. She promised to lay my flowers as a final farewell on the grave of my husband, whom I now had to leave behind in foreign soil but cared for by friendship. How much would the woman, so admired because of her courage, have liked to be ‘die Kleine’ [the little one] again! To return alone to Germany, what an adventure! On the platform I was called back by a guard. However I calmly produced my pass, apparently unconcerned that my armband, which admittedly had been beautifully embroidered in silk by the Judenrat with the Star of David, had been presented to me, must however reveal the pariah to my fellow passengers. The proceeds from my wedding ring had, after paying for the travel expenses, still a small sum left over, which I really wanted to send from the first station, Warsaw, to my sister. However the train was very late, so that I found no other opportunity, and despite the insignificance of the sum looked anxiously towards the checkpoint. But the German officer dismissed my explanation with a wave of the hand and went on. At that one said opposite me, “If it is inconvenient for Madam to travel to Berlin with foreign currency, then I will gladly exchange it for you, as soon as we are across the border. It is all the same to my firm whether I settle in Zloty or Marks.” But when I had left the compartment for a short time, I realised from the chillier atmosphere that one had probably only now discovered my armband, which showed up against the light coat. When we had passed the border I wanted to give the young man the foreign currency. “Forgive me, I did not know that you are a Jewess, now I cannot do it,” he said to me sullenly. As quick as lightning the thought flashed through my mind: why should I trust him not to denounce me on arrival? Who will believe that the Jewess had shown the officer on duty the notes? Could I have made difficulties for myself in the last hour? And so I tore the banknotes and let them fly out. I sat at the window and stared out, sleepless, into the nocturnal darkness. Sweden, Sweden, Sweden, sang the wheels. Is it possible that I am travelling to Sweden? Like dull listlessness it lay on my brain. But then I travelled into the well known Berlin station. I had been able to telegraph my arrival to the Reichsvertretung and despite the early morning hour I was met by colleagues and friends. As if in a dream, without seeing to left or right, I travelled to the acquaintance who wanted to put me up for the two nights of my stay. I had scarcely freshened up when the telephone call came that one was expecting me immediately in the office. There the colleagues greeted me with roses. Everyone had gathered and a member of the Vorstand, that brave man who let his family travel alone to England because he believed he would not be able to answer for it if he left his work, and who has since met his death in the concentration camp, welcomed me with undeserved words of praise about the work I had done and brave conduct. I then reported back about the conditions in Lublin, until one urged me to go to the Swedish consulate for a visa. There one was enormously kind to me. One knew my fate, and although my passport was not a proper passport, one still granted me a visa. My colleagues in the Hilfsverein [Hilfsverein der deutschen Juden: ‘Aid Association of German Jews; provided financial and practical assistance to Jews seeking to emigrate’][64] tried to absolutely insist that I demand a German passport from the appropriate authorities, but now I roused myself from my lethargy and resisted. I wanted to have nothing more to do with the German authorities. I was entirely convinced that one would make difficulties for me at the last moment. The colleagues stood stunned before my outburst, she whom they only knew as self-controlled. However I was no longer a brave woman, but an emigrant gripped by the usual psychosis. The two days of my stay in Berlin were filled to the brim with talks. Also despite the size of the city the news of my arrival had spread like wildfire, and I was assailed by relatives of the deportees, by representatives of associations, had to work with the excellent case worker in the Reichsvertretung through our documents that had reached them in order to demonstrate opportunities for my fellow countrymen to emigrate. One was convinced like me that I formed only the start of a mass onward migration from Poland. The meeting with the leadership of the Reichsvertretung, which had the unthinkable burden of representing the Jews in Germany, I will never forget. I was welcomed in the most affectionate way and gave a report which concerned principally the organisational questions for the necessary assistance. I later reproached myself for having reported so much of the harrowing details and thereby perhaps to have caused alarm. There is certainly a big difference, whether like us one is suddenly placed before unknown conditions from which one hopes to return, or whether like the poor Jews later one must wait for the dreadful and inescapable fate. But my information has then been after all the reason for different organisational measures, so that e.g. no other transport departed without appropriate leadership, [something] that is of greatest importance, not least from the psychological point of view of the poor victims. One did now have time to prepare oneself, as the transports were ‘vorbestellt’ [ordered in advance] i.e. the Reichsvertretung was notified, and the information and leave-taking of the unfortunate people ranked surely among the most heartbreaking tasks of those charged with it. The strain and agitation to which the turmoil of these two days brought me left me quite suddenly listless. I was hugely ashamed of myself, for during the whole time of the deportation such a thing had not happened to me. And it was good for me that the curfew for Jews was so early that the stream of visitors who were waiting for me when I came home could not stay too long. The least time ebbed away for the members of my family. Both sides were accustomed to me belonging predominantly ‘to the others’. However I still think about it with a guilty conscience. The next morning it was then alone to the airport, for no one was permitted to accompany me there, and I was more anxiously afraid than ever before. The flight to Sweden had been given to me and booked in advance by the Reichsvertretung. The customs check passed off very quickly, but when I wanted [to go] through the barrier, a Zollbeamter [customs officer] detained me and demanded the handing-over of my fur. As I produced the permit from the Devisenstelle in Lublin, he ordered instead the detailed examination of the seams and a body search. The aeroplane was delayed by this unnecessary hold-up. That was my last meeting with a German official. As I took my seat by the window I thought: Just do not see anything of the country that I loved so fervently and that now does not know me anymore. And the weather god granted my request and sent us towards thick grey clouds through which the aeroplane had to battle. The rain beat monotonously and gave the exhausted woman sleep. When I awoke it was light again. We were already flying over land, and I caught sight of little red houses. “I am flying over Sweden,” I thought incredulously, as if in a dream. Sweden, Sweden, Sweden, beat my heart. Slowly the great bird glided to earth. I was the first to stand at the door. Am I dreaming, did I not see this in a film? I was already on the steps and looking around expectantly for the friends whom I had been able to notify by telegram of my arrival. I did not know that no one was permitted to enter the airport. “Something or other will still happen to me,” it said fearfully inside me. As if in a dream I went into the hall to complete the formalities. As if in a dream I climbed into the waiting omnibus. There, oh terror, my name was called out. Now something dreadful is going to happen and no one knows where I am! “A car from the city is waiting for you,” the voice continued. As if in a dream I climbed out again. There stood a beautiful taxi that seemed splendid to me, like a Rolls Royce. In the back of the car lay a big bouquet of roses. I climbed in, the car rolled slowly out of the unfenced area. Outside friends, freedom, were waiting for me! The miracle had happened, the dream had become reality. I had been saved!! And I sensed a new mission.

17,"[""Mrs Meyring reports on the wholesale deportation of the Jewish community of Stettin to Lublin 1,200 people among 1,200 people about 100 children and young people which already took place in February 1940. Mrs Meyring describes the transport the wholesale deportation of the Jewish community of Stettin to Lublin 1,200 people among them about 100 children and young people which already took place in February 1940, the terrible cold (many people became ill and Mrs Meyring's aged husband delirious - died soon after) the misery of the three Jewish villages in the neighbourhood of Lublin where they had to stay with the poorest of the poor. Mrs Meyring is one of the few - if not the sole - survivor of the Lublin deportation. Though it was not possible to emigrate, after already been deported, Mrs Meyring - owing to a clerical mistake - was allowed to emigrate to Sweden, what had been granted to Mrs Meyring just before the wholesale deportation of the Jewish community of Stettin to Lublin 1,200 people among them about 100 children and young people which already took place in February 1940 took place. During Mrs Meyring's stay at Lublin Mrs Meyring cooperated with the Judenrat and established, on a very primitive scale, a kind of social service for German and Eastern Jews alike. Mrs Meyring's esteem of the Judenrat is beyond any praise. An English translation of this testimony is not yet available. The Wiener Library is reliant on a team of volunteer translators to this regard this collection of eyewitness testimonies from the 1950s.

Click here to read more about this project. I. as a Jewess I.'s world lay in ruins! I. was no longer a person like others. How could I. comprehend it, I who in tireless work for almost 20 years had worked with other women, led and trained other women to civic thinking, steeped in the same ideas, the same ideals and most fervent love of the Fatherland! How I. was bound up with every paving stone of I.'s home town, Stettin [now Szczecin in Sweden], where suddenly I. had changed from a respected figure into nothing but an unwelcome guest! What use to I. are the many testimonies of friendship? I. still had to comfort the others, protect the others from compromising the others through the others's friendly concern about I.! And I.'s husband understood from the whole situation only that I. was distressed because one had taken I.'s beloved work away from I., and considered everything a nightmare which would pass as it [had] come. my husband went out unconcerned, alas now no longer with my husband's faithful companion, the dog, who had just died. For what should Our group have done after the forced surrender of Our group's home, despite the existing lease, as subtenants with a big dog? I.'s husband was a well-known figure on the street scene. my husband had been born in the same town and everyone was nice to my husband. my husband did not notice either how many avoided greeting Our group, or how many did it ostentatiously, which affected I. almost as painfully by its emphasis. I. was on the brink of suicide, and only the thought that I. could perhaps still be of use to I.'s family’s children through I.'s connections kept I. going. In reality I. was able to do nothing to achieve my family’s children's rescue. my family’s children owe everything to my family’s children's capable mothers. The need to use I.'s talents productively tore I. from I.'s unaccustomed and fruitless introspection. Our group's material circumstances were difficult. The printing works was admittedly, in view of [the fact] that I.'s two brothers had been frontline soldiers, boycotted more slowly; as The printing works had worked however primarily for public authorities and official organs it was not long until The printing works was completely paralysed. I.'s husband had lost my husband's money in part during the war and the remainder during the period of inflation, and it became more and more difficult after moving out of the business to pay my husband the agreed pension. So it became necessary for I. to do something in order to be able to pay for our living expenses, at least partially. That began when I. accepted the offer of an acquaintance to make available a varying number of dresses, with which I. set up a small ‘salon’ in I.'s home. When I. sent I.'s business card, it was a minor sensation to see an acquaintance] in this way. That did not matter much to I.. I. have inherited the great gift from I.'s parents of accepting every situation in which I. find I. ‘and to make the best of it’ as the English say. I. had always been interested in fashionable things and could advise I.'s customers well. In the end however the sender earned more from the business than I., and as I.'s customers liked to converse on this occasion at length and exhaustively about every problem, I. therefore got behind with the household duties which I. now had to carry out alone, which to I. in any case caused significantly more difficulties than selling dresses. I. was therefore very happy when the Jüdische Gemeinde [Jewish community] came to I. with the task of organising the Jüdische Gemeinde [Jewish community]'s Winterhilfe [winter relief] for a small salary, the first income from social activity, I.'s very own field of work. Poor Jews were now no longer permitted to be supported[1] by the Winterhilfe that I, the Jewess, had brought into being, [which had been taken] out of the hands of the women’s associations and placed under the control of the municipality. I. immersed I. in the familiar work which I. performed until I. was appointed firstly secretary, and after six months manager, in the Auswanderungsberatungsstelle [emigration advice centre of the Reichsvertretung der Juden in Sweden : Reich Representation of Jews in Sweden; later became Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Sweden : Reich Association of Jews in Germany][2] with a salary with which I. could pay for a modest way of life, and to I.'s satisfaction became independent as a result. – On the basis of I.'s geographical knowledge I. probably would not have been eligible to take up such a position. What had I.'s generation ever learned in geography, and this narrow fount of memory had become even narrower with time. But I.'s knowledge quickly broadened in an unimaginable way. There was barely a place on the earth which the Jews did not strive to reach in the year 1937 in order to escape the discrimination in the Jews's Fatherland. Only a few people, among them I.'s husband, still hoped that the discrimination in their Fatherland would be reduced to an absurdity. And the year 1938 arrived with the arrest of almost all the men and departure to the concentration camp. Much will be written about this time by [a] respected authority. Here only a small segment from the experiences of a provincial advice centre can be given. On the morning of the catastrophic 9th November I.'s cleaner came (we were no longer permitted to keep a domestic servant due to the moral threat, although I.'s husband was already over 70 years old) and reported the burning of the synagogue. Immediately afterwards I. received a telephone call from I.'s friend with the request to come to my friend on the way to the office. There I. learned of the inexplicable arrest of my husband, however the thought was not far from either of us women that there could be [a] connection here to the burning of the synagogue. On the street we went up to the female employees from I.'s office, the male workers had already been arrested, and [they] told I. that the office had been closed by the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] and The odd couple was now looking for I.. They pointed to 2 men who were approaching us on the same road. At this I. went up to 2 men who were approaching us on the same road and said, “I. just heard that 2 men who were approaching us on the same road want to speak to I.. What do 2 men who were approaching us on the same road want with I.?” 2 men who were approaching us on the same road appeared surprised by the bold speech. I. received the reply, “2 men who were approaching us on the same road must close 2 men who were approaching us on the same road's office and want to have 2 men who were approaching us on the same road's key.” I. responded that the outright closure was not feasible at all as I. was expecting important post for emigration. One said to I. that I. would have to wait for some days and could then enquire from the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] whether I. may continue to work. Depressed, I. went home. There little by little many women that I. knew arrived for whose family emigration I. was working, even I.'s young sister-in-law, so that I. was soon receiving a picture that mass arrests had been made. Also telephone calls for help from the province. “We are alone, what should we do, help us!” The women’s conduct was admirable, which later even the the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] case worker recognised in a private conversation. I. groped at first completely in the dark for the steps which were to be taken, and from the Zentrale [headquarters] in Berlin[3] no instructions were received as I. had not received the post. For three days the stream of visitors did not stop in our home, where I.'s husband and I. endlessly tried to give strength with wine and tea. At last I. felt that the time had come to visit the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police]. I. did indeed receive permission to work again and discovered I.'s office in a tidy state. I.'s conduct at the meeting with the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] was very useful to I. for future work. I. had to compile lists of those men for whom an emigration plan had been secured and hand lists of those men for whom an emigration plan had been secured over during a personal consultation, received also the promise that old men should be released on principle, a special arrangement with the the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] post responsible for I.'s Bezirk [district], the others only followed much later. A tireless work began, and whenever from I.'s Bezirk comparatively very many releases followed very soon, then it was not only thanks to the relentless work of all the colleagues in the office, but not least to the capability of the wives, who by means of imploring telegrams to relatives and friends throughout the entire world conjured up emigration opportunities which would otherwise not have been available. I.'s sister-in-law went My sister-in-law to the Kriegsministerium [Ministry of War] and informed the former commander of the regiment in which I.'s brother had fought as an officer in the war of My sister-in-law's arrest, with the result that I.'s brother was immediately released without proof of an emigration. Even the Vorsteher [board members] of the Gemeinde [community] were released again after a short time on condition Even the Vorsteher [board members] of the Gemeinde [community] admitted a Jewish representative of the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] not only onto the Vorstand [board], but even to submit to a Jewish representative of the Gestapo's measures. With that dawned a difficult, gruelling time for I., at war against this inscrutable man who got this inscrutable man who got his hands on all the organisations, with the exception of my emigration advice centre's hands on all the organisations, with the exception of I.'s emigration advice centre. However the freedom of action which I. retained cost much strength, much effort of nerves and diplomacy. A final remnant of respect, a distant echo of I.'s earlier position, in which this ‘Bevollmächtigter’ [person in power] had already known I., seemed however to protect I.. In I.'s office work was done with the greatest dedication by all the staff, from whom the voluntary workers were indistinguishable. As the consultation hours were always heavily attended, and I. concerned I. with making as much time as the mental state of the present case required, it was never possible to put the post for the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] into the postbox before 11 o’clock in the evening. Each one of us knew that a rapid settlement was necessary in the interests of the people entrusted to us, as the countries’ regulations were constantly changing, therefore there could not be a day’s delay. Every evening I.'s husband appeared in the office, sat patiently with us, my husband's supper a quickly prepared cup of tea, and joined in the sending of the enormous post, because my husband wanted to do my husband's share of the work. Almost every week I. went to the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] in order to support the ongoing applications as much as possible through personal consultation. The work there was done under enormous high tension. It was one of the responsibilities of the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] to allocate the foreign currency, which would be made available from the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] for the payment of the passages and starting out money, between the different cases. However neither foreign currency nor space on ships were available to the extent which would satisfy the demand from the different advice centres of the Land [region], and so the decision of the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] became a verdict which not only the people concerned, but also we organisers who were wholeheartedly involved with our ‘Fälle’ [cases], faced with agitation. The mood of The women’s towards our work became more and more unfavourable, the longer The mood of the wives towards our work took until The women’s's relatives could be freed. When the first men were released from the concentration camp, it was upsetting to see how The women’s ungrudgingly shared in the joy of the others. But already by the third phase one noticed that a depression gained ground, which later often made a depression heard in allegations about [...] unjust treatment. a depression was so very understandable, a depression still hurt so much in the awareness of the efforts made, or of the impossibility of success, if there were no opportunities to emigrate for the people concerned and also the conditions for admission into the English camp could not be fulfilled. I. knew how difficult it was quite particularly for the women in the small towns, who were left there completely without protection and support, exposed as vulnerable to caprice. One allowed oneself also many a special joke at small towns. Thus I. remember the agitated call from a small provincial town where one had taken and imprisoned not only the men but also the children, in order to then give the men but also the children back in the evening to the distraught mothers. In another town one took women and children from women and children's beds and put women and children, [...] dressed only in a shirt, opposite the synagogue so that women and children might watch the fire while the men were marched off as the guilty ones. The contact with the brave and capable women of the province has been a great experience for I.. I.'s Bezirk where I. gave advice was very extensive, and so I. relocated some of the increasingly frequent consultation sessions to the smaller towns. Thus I. obtained an insight into the life of the small-town woman which filled I. with great admiration. The combination of the tasks of housewife, businesswoman and mother was no problem for the small-town woman. Also I. had the opportunity to observe how respected almost everywhere the Jews were, and the way the Jews had been assimilated. As I.'s relationship towards I.'s clientele was not of a bureaucratic nature, but I.'s concern for my clientele's worries and tribulations became mostly deeply felt, so I. managed, in the often negative nature of I.'s endeavours, to be at least an emotional support for my clientele. In the whole of I.'s social work until now there has been nothing so depressing as to have to receive the answer that no possibility of emigration can be found. One should not fail to recognise that it was no advantage for the sought after countries to take in the people stripped of all assets. Much would have perhaps happened differently, if one had been permitted at an early stage to take advances from the large resources from the Fatherland made available through the Joint as a small initial capital, so that the emigrants did not have to settle as beggars. But no situation was more horrible and dreadful than when, after all the formalities had been completed, everyone had upped sticks and the people were ready to travel, the province conditions suddenly changed and the barriers closed. the Jews have really not experienced much global awareness. It must remain [an] object of [...] special consideration to [an] insider to show how the lack of understanding of all countries has contributed to [the fact] that the disaster that has befallen the Jews was able to assume such proportions. I. am almost convinced that the world has deprived the world of the most valuable strengths which would have been qualified to build further on the culture ladder which, as we have now seen with astonishment, has been climbed until now only by a small section of humanity. The Deportation 1940 Into this exhausting, gruelling work February 1940 broke like a thunderclap with its unexpected ‘Auswanderung’ [emigration] of all the members of the Gemeinde [community]. Previously the order had been given, but on the intervention of the Reichsvereinigung der Juden and appeal by the Städtisches Gesundheitsamt [Municipal Department of Public Health] later rescinded, that those Jews who lived in the best quarters of the Gemeinde [community] had to vacate those Jews who lived in the best quarters of the town's homes and had to move into a department store which was standing empty and had formerly been in Jewish hands. the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] had marked out the area with chalk which was to be available to the families and which generously allowed the installation of a bed, of a cupboard as [a] dividing wall from the neighbour and of a carpet as [a] curtain. Even the Oberbürgermeister [city mayor] had protested against the accumulation of the Jews in the shopping district, and so this chalice passed us by. Neither was there any lack of warning voices, which some Provinzvertreter [provincial representatives] relayed to I. and which, coming from ‘sachverständige’ [expert] mouths, indicated an imminent evacuation of the Jews from the Grenzbezirk [border district]. the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police]'s Jewish Vertrauensmann [representative] had already asked I. months ago whether I. was ready to organise with The Gestapo’s Jewish Vertrauensmann [representative] the placement of Jews in Lublin. I. had invariably reported these remarks to the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police], but received the reassuring reply that indeed deportation plans had been made, but an acute danger did not exist at that time. There were two factors which we had not taken into account: the change in the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police]'s Judenreferat [Jewish Affairs][5] in Berlin which took place in January through the appointment of the feared Viennese ‘Austreiber Eichmann’ [Eichmann the expeller],[6] and the burning ambition of our Gauleiter [Nazi party regional leader] Schwede-Koburg,[7] who wanted to make our Gauleiter [Nazi party regional leader] Schwede-Koburg,[7]'s province the first to be judenrein [free of Jews], just as our Gauleiter [Nazi party regional leader] Schwede-Koburg,[7] had also already succeeded in establishing our Gauleiter [Nazi party regional leader] Schwede-Koburg,[7]'s Wahlkreis [electoral district], Coburg, as the first to be Nazi. Although I. am reluctant to talk about I.'s own experiences, about which until now I. have only spoken out to a very small extent even to I.'s friends, I. have to do it in order to be able to give a picture of the events. There will only be a few survivors who are in the position to do this regard and who have obtained such great insight not only into the life of the deportees but also into that of the Polish Jews. But everything that I. described concerns only the year 1940, supplemented by reports made possible some time later by I.'s brother and other friends from there. Certainly Our group's deportation was something terrible, and certainly I.'s fellow countrymen have had to suffer badly, and yet the ambush in which Our group were caught seems to I. to have been easier to bear than the waiting for the inevitable fate and the apprehension of the conditions awaiting them, to which the later deportees were condemned. I.'s husband and I. had had to give up my husband and I's home very suddenly, because the Bürgermeister [mayor] who had moved into our home considered it unbearable, after moving into our home, to live with Jews. A female acquaintance let my husband and I have 2 back rooms of A female acquaintance's large apartment, and my husband and I had gone early to bed and had already been asleep for a long time when I. was suddenly awoken by the sound of the doors opening. A tall man stood there in a yellow uniform who said to I., “Go back to sleep. I. did not know that anyone was still living back here!” Of course I. did not go back to sleep but decided after a brief hesitation to check what was happening at the front of her large apartment. At the end of the long corridor the doors were open. I. saw at I.'s hostess’s 2 uniformed men leafing through documents, likewise at a married couple’s living at the front of the apartment, and now believed that it concerned a tax inspection. At all events I. went in and asked whether one needed I.. No, one did not need I.. I. lay down again in I.'s bed, of course did not wake I.'s husband and was strung to breaking point with anxiety about what was happening to I.'s fellow residents. I. do not know how much time had passed when the bedroom door was opened again and now my hostess’s 2 uniformed men leafing through documents appeared. “Get up immediately. You must leave.” I. woke I.'s husband who, hard of hearing and also sleepy, could not grasp what I. wanted from my husband at all. Then one officer said to my husband, “Listen to what my husband's wife is telling my husband, my husband must get up immediately and leave.”And turned to I., “Get my husband's husband warmly dressed, 2-3 sets of warm underwear. It is cold where my husband are going.” “Where are we going?” “That I. do not know.” In the presence of my hostess’s 2 uniformed men leafing through documents we had to get dressed. “Pack the essentials.” “Bedding, towels?” “Not necessary, my husband will find all that.” And then one officer handed I. a long questionnaire on information about financial standing and possible debts. Then all the money in my home and the costume jewellery which was still there – gold and silver items had already been seized – had to be handed over. Everything was put by my hostess’s 2 uniformed men leafing through documents into a bag. All the food which was in the dining room had to be passed across and was taken away in baskets by the Volkswohlfahrt [Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt; NSV; National Socialist People’s Welfare: Nazi welfare organisation].[8] All the keys to the cupboards had to be handed over. Then I. received 2 primitive cardboard labels with the instruction to put Our group's names on 2 primitive cardboard labels with the instruction to put our names on them and to hang them around our necks and to hang our names around Our group's necks. I.'s husband had until then watched everything with I. in silence. Now however my husband shouted out indignantly, “No, my husband will not do that. my husband am not a criminal.” I. watched as my hostess’s 2 uniformed men leafing through documents turned away with embarrassment. “my hostess’s 2 uniformed men leafing through documents are not a thief, and nobody will think it of my hostess’s 2 uniformed men leafing through documents. But all Jews have to wear it. Look, I.’m tying it around I. and making nothing of it!” When I.'s husband saw that I. was hanging the enormous post around I., my husband staggered so that I. had to support my husband. I. did not understand unfortunately that at that moment my husband had had a shock which brought with it a mental confusion which was only apparent later. From now on my husband allowed everything to happen to my husband, followed without objection. Only when the officer sealed the door did the officer ask, “And what will happen to the enormous post?” And the officer, answered, “my hostess’s 2 uniformed men leafing through documents are taking the enormous post to the Tierschutzverein [society for the protection of animals]. the officer took my husband's suitcase and remained at the officer's side until Our group arrived for embarkation onto the train. In front of my home stood a large omnibus. Our group were the last to get on. It later became apparent that one had at first forgotten Our group. Because of this I. only had 2 hours left to pack and to deal with the formalities, while my hostess’s 2 uniformed men leafing through documents had already appeared hours earlier at the homes of the others and checked. It had been 2 o’clock in the morning when Our group were taken. Deep darkness lay on the streets, and although I. thought I. knew I.'s home town well, it was not possible for I. to tell where Our group were going. At last Our group arrived in front of a big goods shed and saw scores of waiting Jews behind whom Our group lined up. It was a bitterly cold morning. How long Our group had to wait for admittance, I. do not know. One has in such situations no sense of time. It was already daybreak when I.'s husband and I. entered the hall which was crowded with waiting people who had been perched there on their suitcases, for who[9] knows how long, in dull misery. However one observed in particular in the people from the small provincial towns a certain relief when Our group appeared. Later I. learned that Our group were a deportation of 1,200 people, among 1,200 people were roughly 100 children and young people. Our group now had to pass various tables. At one of various tables the accompanying officer took away the bag in which were the jewellery and the cash that had been taken away from Our group. In exchange 20 Zloty, equivalent to 10 Marks, was handed out to Our group. I. saw that in front of the Kontrollbeamter [inspecting officer] lay those forms that Our group had had to fill in back in January on the order of the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police]'s Vertrauensmann for the Gemeinde [community]. Also the emigration intentions had had to be declared, and I. was already able at that time to state that an application to go to Sweden had been made. At a nearby table Our group received a ticket. the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] had allowed the joke to cost Our group something and handed out special tickets with a nonexistent destination. Then Our group were separated for a body search. When I. entered the small room I. saw that some of the Kontrollbeamter [inspecting officer] had once been employed by I. as welfare workers in I.'s former post. [A] painful silence spread around the small room. Then I. proudly stepped forward. “Please?” Shyly one of the Kontrollbeamter [inspecting officer] fumbled with I.'s jacket. “At the border it will be worse,” she said anxiously in a soft voice. Now Our group's paper bags waited, as tall as a man, which it was not possible to carry at all. On the bottom of our paper bags lay 2 or 3? loaves, 1 Fleischwurst [meat sausage], 1 tin of condensed milk, 1 small cheese, 1 tin of jam. In our paper bags therefore no large parcel for which one needed such an enormous bag from the cement factory. But also with this the Gestapo [Geheime Staatspolizei; secret state police] had wanted to have a joke. How Our group had to struggle, in one hand the suitcase and the other hand dragging behind the extremely difficult to handle bag, over the arms blankets and coats; Our group should be photographed for the newspapers, “The food the Jews take with them.” Now Our group went to the waiting trains. It was no cattle truck, as was frequently said, but 4th class carriages which had been withdrawn from service, so that even a lavatory was available. The doors were closed, windows were not permitted to be opened, [something] that, during the 3 days and nights through which Our group now travelled nerve-rackingly slowly, was not complied with however. Our group also needed the snow which was heaped on the window panes to quench Our group's thirst after the little can of milk was quickly emptied. No one had any idea how long the provisions had to last, and so the provisions were quickly consumed by many. But one helped each other out. The awareness that what belonged to one, now also belonged to the others, dawned only slowly and on many unfortunately never. I.'s sister, who was travelling in the same carriage as Our group, was quicker to [realise] The awareness that what belonged to one, now also belonged to the others than I. That I.'s supplies were to be shared was self evident to I., and I. also had too much inner turmoil to be able to make any use of bread. But that I.'s mug and plate, which I. had taken with I. just in case, were claimed by her as common property, seemed to I. in an unacknowledged way highly remarkable and displeasing. I. later learned to be thankful if any mug at all was available for a large number of people. The conduct[10] of the people was in general admirable. No complaints. Everyone trusted that [Our group would] come to a Polish town and until the end of the war have to live there ‘irgendwo’ [somewhere]. Undoubtedly the fact that rich and poor, high and low, indeed the whole Gemeindevorstand [Jewish community council], were among the deportees (with the exception of course of the Vertrauensmann who was probably still indispensible) had a calming psychological effect. I. have also often had [the] opportunity to observe how one’s own conduct is strengthened through common experience, how one is embarrassed in the midst of the same need to allow complaints to be made. But one should not believe that the common fate testifies to altruists. I. have often had to note with concern how crass egotism forges ahead, especially with such people who were the Have-nots. Indeed anyone who behaved always in the most unassuming way was someone who previously had been something, and [was] also most understanding that not everything was to be accepted as a matter of course that the Polish hosts, with the Polish hosts's often weak strength, did for the Polish hosts, and [the Polish hosts's] fellow countrymen, ready to help without concern for their] fellow countrymen's own safety, willingly took upon their] fellow countrymen to arrange for their] fellow countrymen. the train stopped from time to time at unrecognisable stations. Then spotlights shone into the windows and everyone held their breath in fear. Frequently Our group also stopped for a long time on open stretches. The hardest thing was that the carriages were not heated or lit. But with the darkness a blessed drowsiness descended on the exhausted people. But for I. it then began to become very terrible, for I.'s husband had panic attacks. my husband was delirious, believed my husband in the grip of an octopus, wanted to climb into the luggage net and pulled I.'s arms and those of I.'s sister who was helping I. almost out of their sockets whenever we wanted to restrain and calm my husband. During none of the 3 nights was my husband aware of I.'s presence. my husband spoke with I. as with a stranger about us both and I. could have been happy about all the love that my husband spoke about I. if the situation had not been so appallingly sad. If my husband appeared clearer during the day I. told my husband that we were on a convalescent trip, a lovely hotel was waiting for us and we would spend wonderful",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

19,"[""Mrs Schoenewald describes in detail the work done by the Jewish Women's Guild at Bochum between the years 1934 - 1938. In particular, Mrs Schoenewald speaks of the measures to assist the stateless Eastern Jews who were deported from Germany in October 1938. (Polenaktion). Mrs Schoenewald praises the work of the Joodse Vrouwenraad in Holland with whom Mrs Schoenewald worked together on various occasions. (Holidays for Jewish children in Holland; placing of women and girls with Dutch families, etc.). 7.

Aus der Arbeit des Juedischen Frauenbundes in Bochum (1934 - 1938) It may be more tempting to describe dramatic events, but small and seemingly insignificant occurrences are often more illuminating and give a clearer picture of the problems with which we had to do battle in our daily lives, i.e. every day. Nowadays one often hears: “ It is impossible that this or that person who was so close to these events did not know about these events or gave such a false report.” Here is an illustration of this: mine was living in Bochum, and one day mine was invited to a general assembly of the local group of the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities. As the president of the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities, mine would usually be met at the railway station on such occasions, but as a precaution, mine had noted the address of the new Jewish Community Centre because almost everywhere we were no longer permitted the use of public localities. mine took a cab and was most surprised when mine was questioned with expressions of consternation and astonishment as to how mine had managed to find mine's way when mine had not met the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities's representative. mine's reply that mine had taken a cab was met with general disbelief, especially when mine replied to the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities's dismayed questions that mine had given the address of the new Jewish Community Centre. The answer to the puzzle: In Bochum, it was strictly this incisive measure to accept a Jewish passenger or for a Jew to take a cab, under the threat of punishment for both parties. We who lived in the neighbouring town had no idea of this incisive measure. Had anyone asked mine about this incisive measure, mine would have simply denied this incisive measure, although mine “must have known” as the neighbouring town was a neighbouring community. Another incident on the same day: one of the greatest difficulties for all all our organisations's organisations consisted of the rule that all our organisations had to submit the details of every meeting and that we were not permitted to alter the slightest detail such as agenda, location, time, speakers, topic. The registration had to arrive at the relevant authority by post at the agreed time, not earlier, not later, so that any irregularity - 2 - in the delivery could be disastrous for the respective organisation, not only through the cancellation of the meeting but the dissolution of the respective organisation. Usually, two representatives of the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities were present at each session to supervise the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities. On this particular day in Bochum, it happened that the main speaker, a rabbi, was telegraphically recalled through the sudden illness of the main speaker, a rabbi's wife. mine was asked to come to the rescue and to give an account of the Union of Jewish Women. The venerable gentlemen of the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities, two youngsters, gave The venerable gentlemen of the Gestapo's permission with the warning that The venerable gentlemen of the Gestapo would keep a strict eye on this “unforeseen “ speech. mine still remember expressing mine's satisfaction with this “unforeseen “ speech and promising The venerable gentlemen of the Gestapo that The venerable gentlemen of the Gestapo would hear many things that The venerable gentlemen of the Gestapo had previously not known. In this way, mine could be certain to have at least two attentive listeners, a positive outcome for any speaker!There were no consequences so that mine can’t comment on the effect! - 3 - The expulsion of the Eastern Jews (“Ostjuden”) 1938. Why am mine so frightened merely to write about The expulsion of the Eastern Jews (“Ostjuden”) 1938, why does mine's heart beat so hard as to take mine's breath away, even today, as soon as mine think about The expulsion of the Eastern Jews (“Ostjuden”) 1938? Events that directly threatened mine's own fate and life occurred before then and afterwards, but today lives in mine's memory like an abyss, a tear that can never close, a wound that will never heal. And yet, it all happened so calmly, so “organised”, no murder, no manslaughter, no torture, mine almost wrote. But that was exactly what it was, a long-drawn-out, cold, cruel torture. One did not need to have the imagination of a poet, to be a Dante, to think of the lower circles of hell! mine thought that mine would not forget the smallest detail of today, but today has escaped mine completely. mine only know: today was a bitterly-cold October day in 1938. According to Jewish tradition, it all began on the evening before, or rather the afternoon. The doorbell rang continuously; soon, a whole circle of Jewish people, known and unknown, a cross-section of the local group of the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities, was seated in a whole circle of Jewish people, known and unknown, a cross-section of the entire community's large sitting room (library). The tangle of voices made mine realise that something was “up”, but at first it was difficult to extract the facts from the contradictory rumours. “All the Eastern Jews have been arrested”, - “No, only the Poles”, - “Quite the opposite, only the Poles are still free, only the Stateless”! The community secretary came to The community secretary's boss (her boss (that was my husband) was mine's husband) and reported at last reasonably authentically: so far, nobody had been arrested, but only the Poles had been banished and had to leave town early the next morning, together with only the Poles's families. What advice should we give their families, passive resistance, appeal for postponement, acceptance of the expulsion? This depended on the circumstances, whether it was a local measure in which case a whole circle of Jewish people, known and unknown, a cross-section of the entire community or the Jewish general organisation could possibly protest to the Party Leadership and at least try to achieve a postponement, or if it was a general order from “Berlin”. mine, therefore, telephoned the Jewish communities of Essen and Dortmund, and, despite the overlapping confirmations, also the Central Council of Jews in Berlin. After a discussion with her boss (that was my husband) and her boss (that was my husband)'s council, we had no choice but to accept the tough fact and to help the poor expelled people as much as possible. After mine had called the office of the Jewish Women’s Union in Berlin and after discussions with Hannah Karminski in mine's capacity as Union President - 4 - in order to find means and ways to organise care stations at the most important railway junctions, we began the immediate local tasks. Firstly we needed to solicit the help of the few Jewish car owners which was not difficult as most of the few Jewish car owners which was not difficult as most of them were gathered in our home were gathered in our home. the few Jewish car owners which was not difficult as most of them were gathered in our home immediately began to collect suitcases to enable the poor expelled people to take as many of the poor expelled people's possessions as possible. Each time the doorbell rang, another stressful message arrived: “All the men concerned have been taken to prison.” - “ At 8 o’clock in the morning, the women and children must be at the railway station, but the women and children are completely helpless and need support.” So, personal assistance was required. – “All the men concerned are refusing the food in the prison; All the men concerned only want to eat kosher food.” What was to be done? The motorcade drove to all the Jewish butchers to buy all all the Jewish butchers's kosher sausages, then to the bakers who promised to reserve several hundred fresh bread rolls in the morning. We quickly recruited help with the scouring of the large copper washing kettle, and so we were able to appear at the prison at the crack of dawn with ample hot food. Brushing aside the astonished guards, we arrived at the inner courtyard just as the pathetic little heap of Jews was lined up straight. The supervisor in charge who was known to mine indicated that we should deal with the meal at the railway station, and even offered The supervisor in charge who was known to me's car for transporting the steaming cauldron. So far, it all seemed quite “ humane”, as, in general, constant activity helps to overcome inner agitation. This only proved partly true on one day... At the railway station, a teaming mass of agitated, weeping and screaming women and children had gathered, and ever more lorries drove up and, as it were,” discharged” ever more lorries's pitiful load on the forecourt. Bochum was the collection place for the surrounding small and larger localities with a population mainly of workers. mine should take this opportunity to explain why there was such a concentration of Eastern Jews in the Ruhr area. During WWI when Germany occupied Polish lands, Polish men, partly with Polish men's families, were forced to move to the Ruhr area to work in the mines which had been denuded of men. There were so many of men that the communities concerned opened Jewish job centres to look after these involuntary immigrants. Already during WWI or shortly afterwards, the mine authorities took a survey amongst these institutions to establish the contribution of the Jewish “foreigners”. mine read the results mine at the time, which were throughout satisfactory and partly outstanding. After the war, these people opted - 5 - to remain in Germany where these people returned to these people's previous occupations in business etc. thereby losing these people's Polish nationality and being regarded as deserters in Poland. For these people, a return to Poland would have meant the death penalty. This made these people's expulsion so very tragic. Those who had been brought to Germany as children and those who had been born in Germany knew nothing of Poland, had no relationship with Poland and neither spoke nor understood the language. On the day of the expulsion and banishment, there were more pressing needs to be dealt with. - Through negotiations with the supervising the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities officer ( mine's “acquaintance” from the prison yard and from the children’s holiday transport to Berlin) mine had succeeded in reserving the 3rd class waiting room for the women and children, so that the local group of the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities were able to begin an extensive programme of food distribution. The well-known kind Jewish heart exhausted The well-known kind Jewish heart in cheese sandwiches, cake, and coffee. The sausages had been exclusively served to the starving men. It was not difficult to conclude that in some communities the women and children had been fetched from the women and children's beds. All of the women and children were only too ready and keen to relate the women and children's troubles. After mine had telephoned her boss (that was my husband) to elicit her boss (that was my husband)'s permission to charge the costs to a whole circle of Jewish people, known and unknown, a cross-section of the entire community, we activated the motorcade again in order to collect woollen blankets and warm underwear from the Jewish shops that were still available. The continuously renewing line of recipients did not come to an end, but humanity in all The continuously renewing line of recipients's manifestations merely appeared tragic, not repulsive. Only when the same face appeared again and again in the queue, and the competitors became rebellious, justice and necessity had to take precedence over the heart. The stationmaster had disclosed to mine that it would be impossible to organise a special train before 11 p.m. At the same time, The stationmaster promised to add a luggage compartment so that the passengers would be able to sleep in the passengers's seats. This offered us the opportunity to drive some of the men, for whom mine had given a guarantee, back home where some of the men, for whom I had given a guarantee were able to pack bigger cases and thus take some of some of the men, for whom I had given a guarantee's belongings with some of the men, for whom I had given a guarantee, especially children’s things and warm clothes. On listening to some of the men, for whom I had given a guarantee one could hear again and again how very worried some of the men, for whom I had given a guarantee were about the fate of some of the men, for whom I had given a guarantee's businesses. Because of this, mine quickly returned home to get mine's husband who was a lawyer to issue forms for powers of attorney specifically for this purpose. With forms for powers of attorney specifically for this purpose, people were able to nominate relatives or a whole circle of Jewish people, known and unknown, a cross-section of the entire community to represent people's interests. Even then, faith in the efficacy of German justice and business dealings was as great as before. mine do not know if this measure had any practical value after the - 6 - events of the 9th November 1938, but no other measure, no food distribution, not even the permission to come out of the icy cold evening air into the warmth of the waiting room and to join their wives and children, caused even a fraction of the reassurance that the issuing of the “Powers of Attorney” had produced which were pressed into mine's hands at times with words of prayer. Other details? There were dozens that could be related. E.g. there was the 14year-old boy, an apprentice who had been collected from the 14year-old boy, an apprentice who had been collected from his business's business. the 14year-old boy, an apprentice who had been collected from his business's parents lived in Essen, and mine asked that the 14year-old boy, an apprentice who had been collected from his business should be sent there. When the official made a call, it turned out that the Essen transport had already left, and so one could only hope that the 14year-old boy, an apprentice who had been collected from his business would somehow meet the 14year-old boy, an apprentice who had been collected from his business's parents at the “border”. We were told that the transports would be joined together at one point which happened in fact in that the poor expelled people were abandoned in the “no-man’s-land” between the German and Polish borders , on the open fields. We dressed the 14year-old boy, an apprentice who had been collected from his business in warm clothing and gave the 14year-old boy, an apprentice who had been collected from his business a small travelling case and nightwear. Never before or after have mine seen such a beaming, proud face. mine's little friend did not move from mine's side all day and later sent mine faithfully the ready-addressed postcard which was also in My little friend's travelling case, saying that My little friend had not found My little friend's parents! mine did not learn anything further, 9 November occurred in the meantime. mine had long since noticed an ancient, paralysed man; an ancient, paralysed man and an evidently highly feverish young girl were definitely not fit to be transported. Even the Nazi doctor we summoned had to agree, but both of them refused to go to the hospital and insisted on staying with “their people”. The explosion of anger on the part of the young doctor – incidentally the only such occurrence of today – expressed The explosion of anger on the part of the young doctor – incidentally the only such occurrence of the day in the sense ( mine can’t remember the exact words) that one should not have bothered the young doctor concerning the “Jew Rabble”. In response mine told the young doctor (again in the sense of) that mine was responsible for the young doctor's inconveniencing because mine had assumed that this was an expulsion of undesirable Jews, but not a death sentence; but if their people wanted to go voluntarily as their people preferred death to remaining in Germany, then mine could fully understand their people. mine can still see the young doctor's surprised, stupid expression with which the young doctor handed mine the young doctor's referral to the hospital. Then the young doctor whispered with the official, surreptitiously indicating mine, and then departed, muttering and shrugging the young doctor's shoulders. mine think this was the only moment of satisfaction and even fleeting humour for the observers of this scene. However, nobody succeeded in changing the minds of those two patients. the young doctor calmly allowed the young doctor to be tied to the young doctor's chair in order to be fit for transport. - 7 - Expulsion of the “Stateless” (Eastern) Jews from Germany, November 1938 This has turned into a lengthy report, but it was a long day, packed with tragic individual scenes , which left mine with the memory of a tangled confusion. Every individual fate was certainly tragic, but over everything hovered the threat to the total fate of all the Jews in Germany. Fortunately, human nature has a regulating power; sensitivity increases up to a certain climax – and then becomes dulled. Thus, with the arrival of an early dusk, a kind of paralysing sluggishness descended on a whole circle of Jewish people, known and unknown, a cross-section of the entire community. The last woollens had been distributed, hunger and thirst had been quenched, the good fairies of the women’s club and also the selfless drivers had returned home. The children had found peace in the protective arms of The children's mothers, slept on The children's laps or at The children's feet and probably gave off a little of The children's trusting confidence to The children's surroundings. However, when The children were told at 10.30: ”The children to the platform”, we experienced a mass psychosis of the purest form: The children rushed, pushed, although nobody had longed for this moment. The mothers cried out for The mothers's children who were holding The mothers's hand or The mothers's skirt whilst the children cried for the children's mothers, any attempt to create order in this chaos was prone to failure. But in the end, The children was on the platform with “sack and pack” as it is said so accurately, where huge piles of woollen blankets were arranged for distribution. This made a troop of the H.J. (Hitler Youth)on the opposite platform very envious. mine hope that the ensuing conversation between us developed in them the recognition that The expulsion of the Eastern Jews (“Ostjuden”) 1938 was not a joy ride or a “night exercise” but that the recipients of huge piles of woollen blankets depended on the recipients of these woollen blankets for the recipients of these woollen blankets's very lives. The excitement rose to a climax when a distant signal announced the arrival of the train. a distant signal arose like a moan and a sob from one single large body, and at the same time, the hands of the surrounding women and children clung to us as we seemed to the surrounding women and children to be a solid support. mine remember precisely that mine told the surrounding women and children:” It may not be much longer that you, outside in a foreign country, will perhaps say: “Nebbich (pity), those poor things who are still in Germany now. Nebbich (pity), those poor things who are still in Germany now will have nobody to support Nebbich (pity), those poor things who are still in Germany now when Nebbich (pity), those poor things who are still in Germany now's transport comes about!” At least you have someone to wish you “Masseltoff (good luck)” and Shalom ( peace be with you)”. A handshake - and the storming of the seats on the train began. Here once again the natural safety valve: the physical wishes and needs of the moment displace the awareness of destiny. - 8 - One scene which throws a bright light on the situation in Germany must be recorded here: when the afore-mentioned old venerable Jew, in the afore-mentioned old venerable Jew's Kaftan and with the afore-mentioned old venerable Jew's round hat, tied to the afore-mentioned old venerable Jew's chair, was carried into the train, mine heard a young man (in a small group of three Nazi youths) say to a young man (in a small group of three Nazi youths's mates: “Hey, just look at this clown; his mates simply have to make a sketch of this clown in his mates's pad.” Whereupon mine, in mine's fury, turned on his mates and added, not very gently: “Yes, his mates do that, and then never forget what his mates are witnessing here. In all his mates's dreams it should appear to his mates until the end of days!” Again this astonished, embarrassed smile. Whoever spoke like that could not be “one of us”? Maybe a Nazi Women’s representative? In any case, prudence was the better part of valour in this case, and so the “heroes” slunk away without a sketch!Who does not know the feeling of being totally abandoned when a normal train has just left the platform and, instead of the former hustle and bustle, one is surrounded by silence and emptiness. In that fateful night, this was heightened into something almost unbearable so that mine rejected the comforting words of the official and the official” in mine's first emotional reaction. But, for the sake of justice, mine must mention in this report how the station master and the “supervisor” carried out an inhuman order in a humane and much milder manner. the station master and the “supervisor”, too, were Germans. Postscript: Through a report by the Office of the Jewish Women’s Union mine later learned that in most collection places the transports had happened more quickly, that this made the setting up of food distribution on the transit stations impossible, that the “tragic trains” had been diverted onto inaccessible sidings. In Germany, very little could be found out about the fate of those who had been abandoned in “no-man’s-land”. This cutting off all connections, this division of a whole circle of Jewish people, known and unknown, a cross-section of the entire community into helpless little parts, was one of the most effective tactics to induce a feeling of helplessness and abandonment. The Jewish organisations tried to fight against this by grasping every possibility of staying connected, but The Jewish organisations's fate was overshadowed by the feared suspicion of spreading “ horror propaganda”. ( mine particularly recall a personal experience at the advisory council of the Reichsvertretung (National Jewish Representative Council) in 1934 or 1935. mine shall try to find other witnesses still alive.) - 9 - As far as the expulsion campaign is concerned, it is to be noted that each person was only permitted to take RM 10.00. Because many of the intimidated men were wealthy individuals, the consequence of a warning by the supervising official in Bochum was that many of the intimidated men entrusted mine with Thousands (naturally against a receipt and an indication where Thousands was to be delivered). Others who had been “snatched” without warning asked for a loan which in each case was promptly repaid by Others who had been “snatched” without warning's telephonically contacted friends. ( The highest amount was RM 50.00). Of the fate of the people in “no-man’s – land” mine only learned for the first time after mine's emigration to Holland ( March 1939) where mine was recruited to help with a collection of funds for these victims of Nazi persecution. It was a useful learning process to be transferred from the green table to the group of anonymous helpers. Since then mine regard such a collection activity as the most difficult task of any emergency campaign, having always valued such a collection activity as the backbone of such a collection activity. mine never found out how much money was collected and how it was applied as we already had to emigrate further to England at the end of August 1939 ( three days before the start of WW2).On the other hand, mine was able to succeed in a different action in favour of Jewish women who were willing to work and who were looking for a possibility of emigration from Germany, with the encouragement and help from Hannah Karminski in my capacity as Union President - 4 and the Joodsche Frouwenrad ( Jewish Women’s Council) in Holland ( March 1939) where I was recruited to help with a collection of funds for these victims of Nazi persecution. If the recording of mine's memories is to give an explanation and illumination not only to mine but also to those who were not present then, mine will have to widen mine's account and give a more detailed description of the participants, as well as the why and how of the task and the task's solution. Hannah Karminski in my capacity as Union President - 4 was for many years the General Secretary and Director of the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities Office in Berlin and as such also member and secretary of the higher management ( whether this was since the foundation of the Jewish Women’s Union in Germany is not known to mine as mine became the founder of the local branch in Bochum and the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities's leader only in 1926). As “favourite child” and devoted friend of Bertha Pappenheim, Hannah Karminski in my capacity as Union President - 4 lived entirely in the spiritual realm of Bertha Pappenheim, with all the advantages and disadvantages of such an exceptional position. Without a doubt, in Hannah Karminski in my capacity as Union President - 4's thoughts and feelings stamped by the contact with such an idol, despite Hannah Karminski in my capacity as Union President - 4's enthusiasm and empathy, it was - 10 - inevitable that Hannah Karminski in my capacity as Union President - 4's own line of thought was sometimes hidden, especially when decisions had to be made where the difference in age and generation played a part. Bertha Pappenheim once said to mine regarding Bertha Pappenheim:” Bertha Pappenheim is the young person that Hannah Karminski in my capacity as Union President - 4 have formed,” and Bertha Pappenheim spoke ( justifiably, regarding the result) full of pride! From the remarks above, it will not be difficult for the outsider to conclude that the voluntary submission of the young doctor to the brilliant but dominating will of a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities could and did lead to problems in a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union's collaboration with the responsible union leadership, especially in the tension- prone and dangerous period from 1934 – 1939. It is particularly because of this that mine can state with greater joy and satisfaction, and provide documents and letters as proof, that both of us regarded our co-operation as harmonious, with the same purpose, and fruitful in our co-operation's conclusion. a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union was taken over by the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities after the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities was dissolved. a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union surely represented a “women’s union” in a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union. mine am certain that in whatever position a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union found a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union, a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union always remained the representative of the interests of all women, even when unsupported by a large organisation. a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union was surely for any artist’s eye the type of Old Testament Jewish Womanhood and eternal Motherhood. a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union, carried in a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union's heart the destiny of all children. a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union refused to use the emigration visa in a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union's passport as a means of escape. a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union remained in a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union's post and died as a martyr. (mine generally hate the devaluation of this word for involuntary victims of inhumanity, but in this case, it was a voluntary offering of a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union's own life for something a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union recognised as bigger and more important.) Nobody can give any definite evidence for a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union's final fate. Dr. Leo Baeck told mine shortly after Dr. Leo Baeck's liberation from Theresienstadt (Terezin) that , one day, the Union of Jewish Women in Gelsenkirchen which incorporated several neighbouring communities showed Dr. Leo Baeck a picture of a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union and asked:” Do Dr. Leo Baeck know a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union? a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union died last night of pneumonia.” It seems that a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union had been arrested, but where and when and of what a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union really died, Dr. Leo Baeck never found out. A question to this effect was not “harmless” and simple in those days. mine possess a beautiful large picture of a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union which a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union gave to mine before mine's emigration, but a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union becomes most alive to mine through a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union's many letters, suggestions, and publications. - 11 - Particularly characteristic of a personality who at times had no responsibilities within the Union's personality and method of work is a letter, ostensibly addressed to mine which mine received in Holland ( March 1939) where I was recruited to help with a collection of funds for these victims of Nazi persecution (1939).

21,"['A personal report by Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941's husband, Dr. jr. Emil Kafka, former Kultuspraesident of the Jewish community in Prague and Grossmeister odd fellows had gone to Paris in spring 1939 in order to discuss with the American Joint a systematic Jewish emigration from Czechoslovakia. As Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 could not stay any longer in Prague Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 went via Paris to London. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941's wife in return had to suffer from the growing chicanes of the Gestapo and was finally sent, to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto. A personal report by Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 includes a description of the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto life and management; the grosse sperre, before the selections for the transports took place when nobody was supposed to move from the barracks; the liquidation of the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto because of the approaching Russians (from 140,000 people in the beginning only 40,000 were still alive) when most people were sent to extermination camps - Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 to Auschwitz. 8.

Emil Kafka, was the President of Kultuspräsident and Grand Master of ‘Odd Fellows’. The Jewish City Hall was searched only a few days later. They took the passports away from Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941. The Germans demanded foreign currency for each emigrating Jew. foreign currency was urgently needed; that is why The Germans allowed Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 to go to Paris in order to negotiate there with the “American Joint”. From there foreign currency was directly sent to Germany to enable the Jews to emigrate. To create a job opportunity for Jewish emigrants, Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 also had successful talks in Paris with Rothschild. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 returned home on 6 August and went back to Paris on 19/8 and from there went on to London. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 did not go back to Prague. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 was called to see the Gestapo, was called again and again and questioned. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 was prohibited from leaving Prague. The Kommandant who managed the Jewish issue, was called Eichmann, a cruel and hard man. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 read in an English newspaper two or three years ago that The Kommandant who managed the Jewish issue is in Egypt where The Kommandant who managed the Jewish issue continued in The Kommandant who managed the Jewish issue's evil ways. The Kommandant who managed the Jewish issue's successor was Kommandant Günther. It was from Eichmann’s successor that Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 received the order to vacate Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941's apartment as her apartment was confiscated for the Hitler Youth. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 was forced to move in with friends, where Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 stayed for four weeks. On 19 October 41, Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 was sent to Lodz into the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 was allowed to take 50 kilos of luggage, partially walked on foot, until Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 arrived there during a blizzard. the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto was the former criminal quarter, where Polish Jews had already been accommodated for two years, completely starved and ragged figures. the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto was like a small town, consisting of so many wooden huts without windows and without sewerage. More than 80 people dwelt in a normal-sized room. so many wooden huts without windows and without sewerage were often far apart; sometimes one had to walk for a while (15 minutes) over a field to get to the other hut. There was also an old people’s home and an orphanage. The old people’s home consisted of six huts. There the beds were placed closely together; everyone had a bed of their own. In the orphanage, too, each child had each child's own bed. each child died like flies of hunger and cold. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 was given oversight of The old people’s's home and then of the orphanage. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 had to rise at 5 am, make the “coffee”, [crossed out: one was called early to the roll call], then the plank beds had to be put in order, and the rooms tidied up. One queued for hours to get the “rations”. Potato peels were a luxury. Vegetables were cooked out of beetroot-peels. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 had to wash and mend all of the laundry. Everyone was so occupied that - 2 - there was no time, nor energy, nor sense, for possible friendships. One was far too undernourished and exhausted. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 often worked until 12 o’clock at night. People worked hard in the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto. Only the old were exempt from this. The children had to be at the workplace at 7 am already; the girls in the sewing rooms, the boys in a mechanical-engineering workshop. There were countless factories. All kinds of things were made; furniture, fake flowers clothes, shoes, undergarments, artisanal crafts, and so on. One worked from 7 am to 7 pm. The cold in winter was so great that the breath from one’s mouth turned into icicles and lay on the neck and chin and shirt. The block eldest, Chaim Rumkowsky, was a clever, but sadistically-disposed man. The block eldest, Chaim Rumkowsky was the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto absolute ruler. The block eldest, Chaim Rumkowsky thought that as long as the Jews could productively work for the Germans, the Jews would be preserved. Transports arrived incessantly. The criminal police were in the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto and collected Jews who lived in Lodz on a daily basis. Jews who lived in Lodz on a daily basis were beaten terribly. The food rations, which were meant to last for 14 days, arrived very irregularly, sometimes only after 4 weeks. The food rations, which were meant to last for 14 days consisted of the following: margarine or oil – 2 ounces, sugar – 4 ounces, flour – 1 pound., cabbage – 2 pounds, potatoes – 1 pound., bread – 2 pounds, per week. There was only horse meat – once every 6 weeks – 2 ounces. Potatoes were rare. Later there were none at all. One cooked soup from grass in Lodz, until that too was forbidden, because grass was needed for the animals. For the Jews's work the Jews received the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto money, which was only valid in the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 had not seen any coins, but possessed a slip of paper which counted for 10 Marks; a slip of paper which counted for 10 Marks was later taken away from Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 at Auschwitz. The Polish Jews, who had been in the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto since 1939, smuggled in goods from Lodz. One could buy all sorts of things, for example, food: potatoes were 400 Marks per 1 pound. 200 Marks had to be paid for 2 pounds of bread. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941's income, however, was 110 marks per month. In March ‘44 one could suddenly be sent 4-pound-parcels. The bread arrived completely mouldy, but was still eaten; one put The bread into water (for a few hours), and then the mould floated on top of water. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 was grasped by horror when Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 spoke about the transports. At first one knew early on when a transport was being assembled, but later the Gestapo came suddenly, in the night, and took people from people's beds. One night the Gestapo came and took the sick out of the hospital; the sick were gassed in the train carriages or in Auschwitz. The “great curfew” was horrible. Everyone had to remain at home, all streets in the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto were cordoned off. Then the Germans came, selected people and took people away on vehicles. One day the Germans took children - 3 - who were unable to work, another time, old people. Some transports went to the Czenstochau Labour Camp, most, however, to Auschwitz. Those with transmittable diseases (dysentery, typhoid) were put into an isolation hospital. an isolation hospital was run by one Dr Müller. Before the liberation through the Germans, one Dr Müller was forced to set an isolation hospital with all an isolation hospital's inhabitants alight and finally one Dr Müller was thrown into the burning building one Dr Müller. On one day in the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto, 7 men were hanged for a minor offence. Everyone, including the children, had to assemble in the courtyard and watch the procedure. the children screamed and many women fainted. During one of the “great curfews”, one woman did not want to give them one woman's child. her child was torn from one woman's arms, taken by one woman's tiny feet, smashed with the head against the wall, and thereby murdered. Thus there was always made space for newly arriving transports. When the Germans had come close to Lodz, the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto was the disbandment and the survivors taken to Auschwitz. At the start there were 140,000, at the time of the disbandment, only 44,000 were alive. All others had perished. Before the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto was disbanded, the mayor of Lodz came and gave a speech: “The Jews are now going to the bombed out areas and must take with The Jews everything The Jews own.” Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 and two gentlemen belonged to the transport-management. In view of what Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 had done for The Jews, Chaim Rumkowsky, the leader, protected Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941. The German Camp-director was called Herr von Bibow. The German Camp-director wanted to confuse the prisoners by giving the prisoners a letter on the prisoners's way, which were addressed to all German authorities in “Aussig”. “all German authorities ought to be of assistance…”. But the route led to Auschwitz into Auschwitz. They were put into cattle waggons and arrived there at 2 am. Women and men and children. All luggage had to be left in cattle waggons. SS men separated the men, the women, and the children. Then the men, the women, and the children were chased across the Camp Street. Auschwitz consisted of so many blocks with a courtyard each. No tree, no single blade of grass anywhere. One saw nothing but emaciated figures. Some were kneeling, others were leaning against the wall. They wore rags as clothes. The newly arrived were herded past them into a building. There the order came: “Undress!”. The clothes were thrown onto a heap and the women were led away by SS women. Stark naked. Then they came into a different block for a medical examination. Next to Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 stood a young 23-year-old girl with rather weak legs. Although a young 23-year-old girl with rather weak legs assured the doctor in return to the doctor's questions that a young 23-year-old girl with rather weak legs could work – [stating that] a young 23-year-old girl with rather weak legs had proven this in Lodz – a young 23-year-old girl with rather weak legs was declared unfit and was chased with a column of other women into the gas chambers. other women were placed under a shower, and after other women's hair had been shorn off, other women were thrown some dirty rags as clothing. - 4 - By now it was evening and again they were herded into a different block which was built out of wood and had gates at both ends. In the middle a kind of brick bench ran from one gate to the other with troughs and taps. The female camp eldest stood up on a kind of brick bench; The female camp eldest wore a silk nightgown and spoke to them: “You are now in an extermination camp. Early in the mornings and in the evenings you will be called to roll call. You must stand there for many hours. Sometimes from 3 pm to midnight, sometimes early from 3 am. When someone drops dead you are not allowed to stir.” The female camp eldest more or less had privileges. The female camp eldest had a small shed for The female camp eldest, whereas the others lay or kneeled on the concrete floor. When later plank beds were given out to sleep in, 6 women lay on one plank bed; head- feet, head – feet, head – feet. One lay pressed together like sardines. Sometimes one had to stand at roll call on naked clay earth. The arms lifted high and a brick in each hand. On the third day, there was a special roll call. The female block eldest walked up and down, saw Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 stand at the corner or a row; The female block eldest walked close up to Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 and gave Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 an imperceptible push. A sign. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 completely instinctively ran back into a different block which was built out of wood and had gates at both ends, was not noticed and thus escaped the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto. The female German camp commander was called Grese, a cruel, beautiful woman with an angelic face. The female German camp commander wore a becoming grey uniform with a blue blouse. The female German camp commander always had a whip in The female German camp commander's hand and hit at whomever The female German camp commander could reach. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 witnessed how Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 hit an older woman so much that the blood just splashed everywhere. It was a horrible experience to once watch a young woman who was highly expectant and went into labour during roll call. a young woman who was highly expectant and went into labour during roll call stood there immovable for 3 to 4 hours, in spite of the pain. a young woman who was highly expectant and went into labour during roll call then got into the hospital, but the newly born child, a little boy, was gassed immediately. Early, at roll call, one often saw the chimneys of the gas chambers smoking and it smelt of human bones. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 has blond hair. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 assumes that blond hair was the reason why Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941's head was not, as with most of the other women, shaved completely, but only cut short. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 sometimes had it a little better, because Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 did not look very Jewish. The female block eldest even gave Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 a shirt as a gift. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 was beaten twice. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 got ill, had a fever of 42 degrees, but Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 did not call in sick, [but] rather dragged Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 on for fear of the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto. After 6 weeks Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 came into the Bernsdorf Labour Camp, near Auschwitz. Again only such women were selected who had not been completely shaven. In the Bernsdorf Labour Camp, near Auschwitz gasmasks were made, [and] iron traverses carried (these are heavy polls with which buildings are supported when buildings are being built). At Auschwitz the rags often fell from the women’s bodies and the women’s had to walk around naked. It happened that when these starved people received these starved people's rations, sometimes a dozen potatoes were left over. The SS women threw a dozen potatoes randomly into the crowd; these starved people grappled, scratched, beat each other for a potato. Then SS shot into the crowd. Blood flowed and there again were dead people. There was no water closet, but a block with latrines made of stone. Often when their rations were being handed out, the jam was put onto the open hand, only then came the bread and before their rations could eat, their rations were chased into a block with latrines made of stone. Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 sometimes stole away at night to wash Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941. One morning a doctor came, selected 30 women, among 30 women Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941; 30 women were herded into a small shower room. 20 remained there, the other ten came into a small room next to a small shower room. For moment the door was opened and Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 could see with horror that there on benches placed on top of each other, naked women sat awaiting naked women's fate. the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto was a gas chamber. The director of the factory in Bernsdorf was called Schlechta; The director of the factory in Bernsdorf had a spinning workshop and a weaving workshop; gas masks and munition were made there. In the Czenstochau Labour Camp were 311 female Jews. 311 female Jews had to work in the different areas. The director of the factory in Bernsdorf treated 311 female Jews decently. The director of the factory in Bernsdorf even sometimes whispered to 311 female Jews news about the state of the war. In Bernsdorf there was a Jewish and an “Aryan” dining hall; in an “Aryan” dining hall were Poles, French people, Belgians and others, who had been sent for forced labour. The director of the factory in Bernsdorf sometimes smuggled a piece of pork from the “Aryan” kitchen to 311 female Jews and each received a small piece. The director of the factory in Bernsdorf was not a Nazi. For Christmas The director of the factory in Bernsdorf gave 311 female Jews a small parcel as a present. In a small parcel were 5 small pieces of marzipan, as well as a pocket mirror and a comb. 5 small pieces of marzipan, as well as a pocket mirror and a comb were all valuables. The director of the factory in Bernsdorf had work suits made for 311 female Jews, because it was so terribly cold there. The director of the factory in Bernsdorf had even been allowed to buy clothes that had been handed over at Auschwitz; The director of the factory in Bernsdorf officially bought coats for 311 female Jews, for 311 female Jews. When 311 female Jews wanted to herd 311 female Jews into the country’s interior at the end of the war – these was known as the death marches, because 311 female Jews died on the way from weakness or were shot – The director of the factory in Bernsdorf negotiated with the SS women. In vain. At that time, by chance, The director of the factory in Bernsdorf came by bike. The director of the factory in Bernsdorf spoke with The director of the factory in Bernsdorf for a long time and effected that 311 female Jews remained where 311 female Jews were. The director of the factory in Bernsdorf invited Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 and Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941's fellow sufferers to The director of the factory in Bernsdorf's villa in Trautenau, where Mrs Kafka and her fellow sufferers were cared for and nursed by The director of the factory in Bernsdorf and The director of the factory in Bernsdorf's wife for 4 weeks. Whether The director of the factory in Bernsdorf did this to escape punishment – his wife could not say. The director of the factory in Bernsdorf got 18 months in prison, because The director of the factory in Bernsdorf was in SS. The director of the factory in Bernsdorf claimed The director of the factory in Bernsdorf had been coerced. - 6 - A small episode is still to be mentioned: When Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 one day was sitting on the balcony in Trautenau, where they were cared for and nursed by him and his wife for 4 weeks, the previous workshop master of the Labour Camp came. the previous workshop master of the Labour Camp was called Wolf. In the Labour Camp the previous workshop master of the Labour Camp addressed Mrs Kafka and her fellow sufferers as follows: “Jewesses go over there, go over here….”. Now, however, the previous workshop master of the Labour Camp said: “Good day, madam [Austrian phrasing], now Jewesses are rid of the gang!” After four weeks, Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941's “Aryan” brother-in-law came and took Mrs Kafka’s “Aryan” brother-in-law back to Prague. When after the war Benes and Benes's entourage left England and returned to Prague, Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 went, too. Hence the two were reunited. But only two years later Mrs Kafka, formerly from Prague, who was deported to the Lodz-Litzmannstadt Ghetto on 19 October 1941 died.

22,"[""A description of conditions for Jews in the various places visited immediately following the liberation. The author states all the information The author has gathered regarding the fate of the Jewish communities, data of deportations, the extent of destruction of Synagogues and cemeteries. At Gross-Gerau the new Burgermaster has made the local Nazis rebuild the destroyed Jewish cemetery in the course of the Sunday morning forced-labour scheme introduced by the new Burgermaster. At the same place a returning Jew was received back “royally” by a returning Jew's former fellow-members of the “Reichsbanner”, who insisted that a returning Jew should stay there. A Jew in Hamburg has told A Jew in Hamburg a “deportation story with a difference”; A Jew in Hamburg's was the last wedding in Hamburg before the deportations started. In 1943, the couple was taken to Theresienstadt, where it was prohibited to have babies. Yet the woman had the woman's baby born there, and as the woman had scarlet fever at the time the woman was allowed to have her baby and got away with her baby. The husband was taken first to Dachau and then to Auschwitz, was included with one of the notorious “death-marches”, survived and returned to Hamburg. Only a few days later The husband's wife turned up with the baby boy - by then a year old. Theirs was now the first circumcision ceremony held in Hamburg again. From The author's observations The author has come to the conclusion that on the whole the smaller Hamburg the better the Jews there are now looked after, because there is the personal touch about it and those in office now are usually those who were friendly to the Jews before. See related testimony P.IV.b. No. 568 for further information. Fate of Surviving Jews in some German Communities Visited by Sgt. K. Ambrose in August 1945 FRANKFURT A.M. Of a community of about 30,000 pre-war, there are some 300 to 500 left, including about 10 children (!). Those who have returned from various camps get the heavy workers ration allowance (as in other parts of the country), and all Jews, I believe, have received an allocation of wood for the winter. But those seem to be about the only privileges all Jews get. The Synagogue in the Friedrichstrasse which only suffered interior damage when the Nazis burnt The Synagogue in the Friedrichstrasse which only suffered interior damage when the Nazis burnt it in 1938 and has not suffered bomb-damage in 1938 and has not suffered bomb-damage, has been redecorated simply and was used again for the Festivals, when about 1500 American and other servicemen attended as well as all the available civilians. The Synagogue in the Friedrichstrasse which only suffered interior damage when the Nazis burnt it in 1938 and has not suffered bomb-damage, I understand, is the only synagogue in use in Hamburg. The secular matters of a community of about 30,000 pre-war are managed from the offices adjoining The Synagogue in the Friedrichstrasse which only suffered interior damage when the Nazis burnt it in 1938 and has not suffered bomb-damage. Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt) is managing both secular and religious affairs. a community of about 30,000 pre-war is frequently visited by ex-refugee American soldiers. PFUNGSTADT. nr. Darmstadt This little town of about 8000 or so inhabitants used to have about 10 to 20 Jewish families. There are of course none there now. However I happened to hear about there still being a synagogue so I went to investigate. I did indeed find the building which used to be a synagogue. But a synagogue showed no signs on the outside which might betray a synagogue's original purpose. a synagogue had been given a large iron door on the street front to admit farm wagons, as a synagogue had been used as a vegetable distributing centre. a synagogue is now locked up altogether, and as I was only in This little town of about 8000 or so inhabitants for a few hours I couldn't pursue the matter any further. There was a stone lying by the side wall with the year ‘1922’ on a stone lying by the side wall with the year ‘1922’ on it. Presumably the year ‘1922’ was the year a synagogue was built or inaugurated. I took two photographs of a synagogue, which I will send on when two photographs of the building, which I will send on when they are developed are developed. GROSS GERAU, nr. Hamburg a.M. This little town of about 8000 or so inhabitants is supposed to have had quite a community of about 30,000 pre-war. When we arrived in This little town of about 8000 or so inhabitants a few weeks ago, only one Jew was left there, and only one Jew was a half-wit who was in an institution. a synagogue was entirely demolished by the Nazis in 1938. The cemetery was badly knocked about by the Nazis, but the new burgomaster is making the local Nazis put The cemetery back into shape in the course of the Sunday morning forced labour scheme which the new burgomaster has started there. Rather a remarkable little incident occurred in This little town of about 8000 or so inhabitants: there were two young brothers Goldberger here before the liberation. One emigrated to America, and just recently passed through This little town of about 8000 or so inhabitants as a lieutenant. The father was shot in Berlin, and the mother died in a concentration camp. The other son, who is now 26, was sent to Buchenwald, I believe, in November 1938. However, The other son, who is now 26 managed to escape later and got to Jugoslavia. The other son, who is now 26 was there caught by the Italians and interned in Italy. When the Nazis marched in The other son, who is now 26 was liberated, got the status of a Displaced Person and served as Batman in the South African Army until recently The other son, who is now 26's - 1a - unit was posted back to the Union of S. Africa. As The other son, who is now 26 was only a civilian D.P. by status, The other son, who is now 26 could not go with the Union of S. Africa and asked to return to The other son, who is now 26's home town of Gross Gerau, which The other son, who is now 26 did just while we happened to be there. According to The other son, who is now 26's own account The other son, who is now 26 was received ‘royally’ by The other son, who is now 26's old friends (i.e. The other son, who is now 26's former fellow members of the ‘Reichsbanner’ etc.), and his old friends (i.e. his former fellow members of the ‘Reichsbanner’ etc.) insisted that The other son, who is now 26 should stay there. The other son, who is now 26 asked to join the police force (which consists of about 9 persons) so that The other son, who is now 26 could settle up with a few outstanding Nazis who hadn't been dealt with yet. This was granted at once, and The other son, who is now 26 is now apparently happy in The other son, who is now 26's job. When the present police-chief retires, which should be in a few years, The other son, who is now 26 hopes to become chief in The other son, who is now 26's place, and The other son, who is now 26 considers that a satisfactory position, as The other son, who is now 26 is not ambitious. Meanwhile The other son, who is now 26 is living with some friends of The other son, who is now 26's, where The other son, who is now 26 is being treated like some friends of his, where he is being treated like their own son's own son (this is again in The other son, who is now 26's own words), and The other son, who is now 26 draws on The other son, who is now 26's farmer-friends in the neighbourhood for food. Apart from that the new burgomaster is a good friend of The other son, who is now 26's and fixes The other son, who is now 26 up with anything else The other son, who is now 26 needs. The other son, who is now 26 even had a house offered The other son, who is now 26, which The other son, who is now 26 refused for the time being as The other son, who is now 26 is better off where The other son, who is now 26 is now. Sounds rather like a ‘local boy made good’ story but is nevertheless true. - 2 - WUERZBURG There are about 50 Jews here at present, of whom only 14 are ex—Wuerzburgians of an original 1500, the remainder being Poles and other Displaced Persons. The 14 are all, I believe, ‘returnees’ from Theresienstadt and other camps, and include the two families who were (and are now again) caretakers of the Jewish Cemetery. I am getting a complete list of names which will be forwarded to the Association of Jewish Refugees as soon as possible. The caretakers of the Jewish Cemetery are living at the Jewish Cemetery, Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt) and Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt)'s whole family (grandmother, aged over 70, wife, son of 17 and daughter of 13 years, all ex-Theresienstadt) are living in the Gauleiter's (Rottendorfer Str. 26), where Jewish Services are also held. All the reminder, I believe, are living together in the Jewish hospital. There are a fair number of Jewish American soldiers (including officers) stationed in This little town of about 8000 or so inhabitants, and a fair number of Jewish American soldiers (including officers) stationed in this town are looking after a community of about 30,000 pre-war quite nicely. Nothing much is done for a fair number of Jewish American soldiers (including officers) stationed in this town officially, but a fair number of Jewish American soldiers (including officers) stationed in this town seem to be getting quite reasonable assistance from a fair number of Jewish American soldiers (including officers) stationed in this town. Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt) is in charge of the communal affairs, and is working for the Military Government. One of Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt)'s tasks there is rather amusing; Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt) has to check up on the people who have suddenly discovered that the people who have suddenly discovered that they had a Jewish grandmother or even father had a Jewish grandmother or even father. Among all those Jews there are only one child of 2, one. girl of 13, and a boy of 17 (the latter two being Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt)'s), the others being grown-ups. Wuerzburg Synagogue was completely destroyed by the Nazis and a workshop erected on Wuerzburg Synagogue's site. Wuerzburg Synagogue in turn was completely bombed out, so perhaps we can build another synagogue there. Meanwhile Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt) is collecting money for a memorial for Jews murdered by the Nazis; I am enclosing a specimen receipt. In the suburb of Buchenwald there is only one complete ‘Non-Aryan’ (of Christian faith, I believe) left. He is Dr. Igenberg, who is practising again now as a doctor, and is fairly well looked after by the local authorities, most of whom he knew personally before the Nazi period. It does seem on the whole that the smaller This little town of about 8000 or so inhabitants and the Jewish community, the better the Jews there are now looked after, because there is the personal touch about it, and those in office now are usually those who were friendly to the Jews before. In a large town like Hamburg or Frankfurt nothing short of official regualtions will make life more pleasant for any surviving Jews, and such official regulations are not usually forthcoming. I am told that the Jewish Cemetary in Buchenwald was one of the oldest in the country. the Jewish Cemetery had been out of use for some years, all funerals having recently taken place in Wuerzburg Wuerzburg itself. the Jewish Cemetery is very derelict and grown over, and a large number of stones are still where the Nazi hooligans left a large number of stones in 1938. However the Jewish Cemetery is now being cleared up. DEPORTATION STORY WITH A DIFFERENCE I spoke to a Jew in Hamburg, whose name I did not ask, and who might have been 30 to 35 years old, although the marks of what a Jew in Hamburg, whose name I did not ask, and who might have been 30 to 35 years old had been through made a Jew in Hamburg, whose name I did not ask, and who might have been 30 to 35 years old appear rather older. a Jew in Hamburg, whose name I did not ask, and who might have been 30 to 35 years old's was the last wedding in Hamburg Synagogue before the deportations. a Jew in Hamburg, whose name I did not ask, and who might have been 30 to 35 years old and a Jew in Hamburg, whose name I did not ask, and who might have been 30 to 35 years old's young wife were taken to Theresienstadt in 1943. It was prohibited in that camp to have children. However, He and his young wife had a baby there and somehow, because his young wife happened to have scarlet fever at the time and was in hospital, his young wife was allowed to have a baby and got away with a baby. But a Jew in Hamburg, whose name I did not ask, and who might have been 30 to 35 years old was sent to Dachau. From Dachau a Jew in Hamburg, whose name I did not ask, and who might have been 30 to 35 years old was sent to Auschwitz. From Dachau, when the Nazis approached, He and his young wife were sent on one of those death—marches which started with 7000 and finished with 2000. Then He and his young wife were liberated. - 2a - The man_returned to Hamburg, where a Jew in Hamburg, whose name I did not ask, and who might have been 30 to 35 years old found a Jew in Hamburg, whose name I did not ask, and who might have been 30 to 35 years old's parents-in-law and lived with his parents. a Jew in Hamburg, whose name I did not ask, and who might have been 30 to 35 years old had not been there more than a few days when a Jew in Hamburg, whose name I did not ask, and who might have been 30 to 35 years old's wife turned up with the baby boy - by then a year old, now a year old! So going to be the first ceremony of Circumcision there. Incidentally, the rescue of the whole complete family of Fechenbach (mentioned above under ‘Wuerzburg’) is also quite remarkable, especially as the rescue of the whole complete family of Fechenbach (mentioned above under ‘Wuerzburg’) included his young wife, and since the baby boy - by then a year old served a spell at Auschwitz towards the end, where the baby boy - by then a year old only escaped the gas chambers by hiding in the bunkers. Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt) maintains that Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt) owes Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt)'s life to an Allied raid on Nuremberg. Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt)'s being a mixed marriage, Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt)'s number wasn't up until quite late in the liberation. Just when matters became critical, we raided Nuremberg, and amongst many other good jobs there destroyed the Gestapo records. Since Nuremberg Gestapo covered the Nuremberg area, Rabbi Dr. Neuhaus (who has returned from Theresienstadt) was not thereafter troubled.

uring the last few days. Kramer,"['A personal report on Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna's experiences at Dachau and Buchenwald (June 1938 - January 1939). Interesting and detailed description of life in Dachau and Buchenwald. 4. Date : October 1955. 5. Number of pages : 4 1/2. 6. Author or Source : Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna. 7. Recorded by : Dr. W. Berent. 8. Further References : a) Places : Vienna; Buchenwald; Dachau. b) Individuals : Kerll, Lagerkommandant at Dachau; Wagner, Sturmfuehrer at Dachau; Koch, Kommandant at Buchenwald; Ilse Koch at Buchenwald. The experiences and observations of Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna under the National Socialists Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna lived in Vienna as an employee in a business. Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna's father was a rabbi, who owned a large property in Vienna, which he My father administered. The builder had built into the front of a large property in Vienna, which he himself administered a decoration with a large Star of David in glass. Two days later, after the 11th of March 1938, when the Germans moved into Vienna, a squad of SS people appeared in front of our house and smashed the glass pane with a large Star of David in glass on the glass pane with the Star of David. There was a lady who lived in our house who was known as a shoplifter. a lady who lived in our house who was known as a shoplifter son wore a Nazi badge, although on This woman’s son's father’s side This woman’s son was not a pure Aryan. One day, This woman’s son stood in front of our house with a rifle and said that This woman’s son wanted to shoot the landlord, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna's father. As a consequence, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna wrote a note to the SS and objected that young Jewish persons were running around with a rifle threatening others. The upshot was that an SS squad appeared, took a rifle from This woman’s son and tore off a Nazi badge. Apparently, later This woman’s son was recognised as Aryan and as a Nazi again. Soon after, we heard that Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna's father, who was considered to be wealthy, was in danger of being arrested. As a result, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna's father went to a hiding place where My father could evade the enquiries of the Nazis. As so many other Jews, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna's mother, brother and Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna were often conscripted to clean the streets. The deportation of Jews to concentration camps began at this time. To this end, those Jews who had ever come into conflict with the law, were particularly singled out. Once, in 1930, without thinking Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna had used the discounted return ticket of another on the train. As a result of this, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna was prosecuted at the time, but Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna was not fined. This affair was still in the memory of the police inspector in charge of our area. the police inspector in charge of our area summoned Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna and for no other reason Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna was sent to Dachau. The same happened to a friend, upon whom a very minor bicycle transgression had been imposed some time past. In the first transport to Dachau there were a lot of prominent people: ministers, senior civil servants, and doctors etc. Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna was taken on the second transport on the 2nd of June 1938 to Dachau. The journey there was extremely unpleasant. Our custody was assigned to Bavarian SS people who hit out in the roughest manner at every opportunity. On either side of every compartment 6 prisoners sat in the 4 places. We were required to look at the ceiling light the whole time. Anyone who did not do that was beaten. We were not allowed during the whole journey of 26 hours to go to the toilet. Also, it was worse because we had no idea where we were going. In Munich we were loaded into cattle waggons. During the difficult climb into the waggons, which were later sealed, many of us were beaten. As a result, some suffered leg fractures. A certain Walter Hand, who was hard of hearing, was shot when A certain Walter Hand, who was hard of hearing misunderstood an order and carried an order out incorrectly. After our arrival at Dachau, we had to go through a column of SS men armed with rifles and machine guns, who shot into the air, as part of the process of intimidating us. As a result, some of us received grazes from shots. Even an SS man was accidentally shot during this affair. The next day was a day of rest for us because the SS had to attend the funeral of the SS's comrade who was shot. On the day after, we all had to strip naked and were then led to the showers. When Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna attempted to grasp the soap, in order to use the soap, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna was hit because Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna wanted to use the soap. After Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna had washed without the soap, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna was beaten again because Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna did not use the soap. In this way, everything occurred as a pretence, in order to torment us. Sturmführer Wagner behaved especially badly in this. After the showers, our heads were shorn and we received camp clothes with certain badges. Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna had to wear on Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna's items of clothing the red-yellow Jewish badge. Then the camp commander, Kerll, gave us a speech in which the camp commander, Kerll said nothing would happen to those who behaved properly, but those who did anything wrong would be severely punished. Afterwards we were lined up in rows of 6 and it was announced that every thirtieth person would be shot. We were counted and every thirtieth man was pulled out. The men, who were withdrawn, were led to a field nearby. As it later transpired, it was again only an attempt to intimidate us. After that the people came back to us without anything happening to the people. The barracks in which we were accommodated comprised two sections. One part served as a dining room whilst the other was the sleeping area. There were bunk beds in the latter and there were 60 prisoners in Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna's room. We were wakened at 5 o’clock in the morning and had to be out of bed in seconds, in order to avoid being reported by the the SS guard. Making the bed was an especially difficult affair. The blankets had to be dead straight and lying without any creases. Generally, you could see a lot of cleanliness and order. Every prisoner had to shave daily. After making the bed, we had to march off in strict military fashion to get some coffee. There was a weekly bread ration. The rest of the food was bearable. At 6 o’clock, there was the register and count on the assembly ground. The individual sections were reported by The individual sections's Kapos. After the register and count on the assembly ground, followed the marching off to work. In the main, the work consisted of road building. We participated in the extension of a motorway. If there was no work to hand, they had us carry stones to make a pile, and after, we had to carry stones to make a pile back again. The other works to which Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna was consigned were: sweeping the courtyard with a brush, and planting flowers and then watering flowers from a can which was very heavy to carry. The treatment meted out by the SS guards during this to keep us on our toes, varied. We were often beaten during the work. To go to the toilet, you had to report in a special manner. It was prescribed for this purpose that we may not come closer than 6 metres to an SS man. A well-known businessman, who contravened this regulation, was shot by an SS guard. The entire camp was constructed as a large square. First of all, The entire camp was protected by a ditch, then by an electrified barbed wire fence and finally by a wall upon which there were a number of machine gun tours. It was a rule that anyone who was spotted in a ditch would be shot. One day, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna was working with others about 1 metre away from a ditch. We had to bring a wheel-barrow full of gravel to a ditch and unload gravel. By and by a hillock of gravel developed which in the end was overlain with planks which we had to go up with our wheel-barrow, in order to unload our wheel-barrow. In doing this, a prisoner fell over with a prisoner's wheel-barrow and pushed Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna into a ditch. At any moment, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna expected that Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna would be shot at. The SS man in charge had apparently given a sign not to shoot at Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna. Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna was pulled out of a ditch with help from a rope, and because Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna was half unconscious through fear, taken away in a wheel-barrow. Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna stayed for 4 months in Dachau. Then we all were to be transferred. We had to give up the clothing which we wore and we were supplied in return with completely torn clothing. Wearing this, we marched off. We were all very depressed because during our stay we had become used to Dachau and did not know what was going to happen to us. We were loaded onto the railway and arrived in Weimar via Jena. Here we had to get out, and we were marched through Weimar, accompanied by SS men with drawn revolvers, to buses which took us to the Buchenwald concentration camp. From the beginning, the Buchenwald concentration camp made a very poor impression on us. the Buchenwald concentration camp was not completely built and the Buchenwald concentration camp was extremely dirty. In every respect, the Buchenwald concentration camp was much worse than Dachau. In the barracks, there were three beds one upon the other and the rooms were extremely crowded. The food was in no way sufficient and the cutlery was rusty. Water was scarce and there were only open latrines there. In addition, proper supervision did not exist. Common criminals, who had been imprisoned as such, were appointed as Kapos in the individual barracks. They treated Jewish prisoners very badly and often doled out beatings. It became especially bad after Kristallnacht on the 10th of November 1938, when around 13000 Jews were brought into the Buchenwald concentration camp. Many of around 13000 Jews came in already badly beaten up and were further mistreated in the Buchenwald concentration camp. The crowding in the Buchenwald concentration camp now became terrible and also the food was scarcer than before. The guards here also tormented us to extremes. The guards here always sought out new things to make our lives unbearable. For example, The guards here forced us to ride piggy-back and chivvied the pairs against the pairs. The consequences for us were often bloody heads and other injuries. Once, two prisoners escaped. One was caught soon after and immediately hanged. The second succeeded in fleeing to Czechoslovakia. Later The second was brought back from there and likewise hanged. On the occasion when two prisoners escaped, we all had to report in the evening to the parade ground and stand outside the entire night in a temperature of minus 32 degrees. 33 prisoners died the next day from exhaustion. Later, the number of the dead increased. The commander of the Buchenwald concentration camp was the infamous Koch. Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna had nothing to do with The commander of the camp and so Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna cannot report anything about The commander of the camp. However, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna was once commanded to the work out cleaning work in The commander of the camp's villa which lay 10 minutes from the Buchenwald concentration camp, and whilst doing the work, met The commander of the camp's wife Ilse Koch. Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna cannot say that his wife Ilse Koch treated badly either Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna or those colleagues with whom Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna carried out the work. Worth mentioning though is that an orchestra was formed from prisoners who had to play marches, soldiers songs and other pieces as prisoners went off to work and when prisoners returned. The “Buchenwaldlied[1]”, which was the internee Rainer Huppert’s poem set to music by Leopoldi, another internee, was especially popular. The camp commandant The camp commandant himself always wanted to hear The “Buchenwaldlied[1]”, which was the internee Rainer Huppert’s poem set to music by Leopoldi, another internee,. Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna include a copy of The “Buchenwaldlied[1]”, which was the internee Rainer Huppert’s poem set to music by Leopoldi, another internee, and one of another song from a different camp. Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna would like to state an opinion contrary to that expressed by some former inmates of Dachau and Dachau that it had not been so bad there, like it was claimed by an 80 year old man who was incarcerated with Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna. an 80 year old man who was incarcerated with me enjoyed special treatment because of an 80 year old man who was incarcerated with me's age, treatment not granted to anyone else. an 80 year old man who was incarcerated with me was in a barrack which was under the command of the Kapo Brandel who was formerly a communist member of parliament. the Kapo Brandel who was formerly a communist member of parliament looked after an 80 year old man who was incarcerated with me and arranged that an 80 year old man who was incarcerated with me was released from any work and also organised a collection of money for an 80 year old man who was incarcerated with me. Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna's stay in Dachau ended on the 13th of January 1939. In response to Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna's request, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna had received an entry visa for England, and as a consequence, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna received Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna's release from the Buchenwald concentration camp. With a group of others who were equally fortunate, Mr H. Hager, formerly of Vienna left there and reached England without any further mishaps. [1] Buchenwald song ']", but when the armoured car entered the camp he had still mobilised a SS-command and given orders to shoot if the prisoners would endeavour a break-out of the camp. - 18 - After the British had taken command of the camp a penal unit of the German Wehrmacht had to bury at least 4,000 corpses who had been lying in piles when the British entered the camp. After six days an American film team arrived to make a film of Belsen. I had a conversation with the cameramen," who became very much shocked at what they saw. I was shocked and surprised about their ignorance of the situation under National-Socialist reign. I told them that not in all their pictures they would be able to bring out the smell of the dead and this was during the last months of the existence of this camp the most characteristic thing.

23,"['A personal report by Mrs L. Picker on Mrs L. Picker's experiences, first, in Vienna (1938 - 1942) and later in Eastern Concentration Camps where Mrs L. Picker was separated from both Mrs L. Picker's husband and daughter of whom Mrs L. Picker never heard again. 4. Received : 17 August 1955. 5. Number of pages : 6. Language : German. 6. Author or source : as above. 7. Recorded by : Dr. W. Berent. 8. References : Guttava; Riga Ghetto; Kaiserwald; Spilve (hut camp); Stutthof; Tambo (Russian Hospital). murder of children (p.4). 9. Remarks : Mrs L. Picker owes Mrs L. Picker's life to the Russians, not on account of the liberation the liberation itself, but because of the wonderful treatment by the Russians's doctors and nurses. Mrs L. Picker spent a whole year in the Russian hospital. “Erlebnisse und Erfahrungen, unter Nationalsozialistischer Herrschaft” Mrs L. Picker am an Austrian citizen and lived in Vienna together with Mrs L. Picker's family. Mrs L. Picker's husband had been an employee of the Laenderbank (state bank) in Vienna and received a state pension from the Laenderbank (state bank) in Vienna. With the support of Mrs L. Picker's husband, Mrs L. Picker ran a textile manufactory and purchased the produced goods to resellers. When the German troops occupied Vienna in 1938, restrictive regulations for the Viennese Jews were legislated very soon after. the Viennese Jews were only allowed to show the Viennese Jews publicly in the streets until 4 o’clock in the afternoon, the Viennese Jews were not allowed to visit theatres, cinemas or cafés. Especially from 1940 onwards, the regulations against the Viennese Jews were intensifying. the Viennese Jews were forced to wear the Judenstern (yellow star badge) and to give up the Viennese Jews's homes if the Viennese Jews were not in the vicinity of the Second Viennese District and to move to the Second Viennese District. The vast number of Jews living there were coerced into providing rooms in The vast number of Jews living there's own homes to The vast number of Jews living there's coreligionists from other districts. It was often the case that Jews, regardless of Jews's age or social standing, were forced out of Jews's accommodations to carry out road cleaning works. At the same time, Jews boycott of Jewish businesses began. Until 1940, us's personal situation as well as the situation of us's business had been halfway bearable. Then one day, some people appeared who told us that they allegedly were ordered to scrutinize us's firm’s books of account. Some days later, they declared to us that they had received the order to take over us's business. us had to give them the keys and were coerced into surrendering us's business including the available goods in stock, all of the machines, cutting tables etc. to our business including the available goods in stock, all of the machines, cutting tables etc.. They claimed that us were to receive a compensation. However, us never got anything. Fortunately, Mrs L. Picker's husband still had My husband's state pension, which My husband was receiving at least temporarily, since our firm’s was a French business. us were subsisting solely on his state pension, which he was receiving at least temporarily, since the Laenderbank was a French business. The small apartment in the Second District, which us had to move in to, was conducive to minimizing the living expenses. Apart from that, there was not much available for us to buy anyway. Jews did not receive Kleiderkarten (ration cards for clothing); hence, us were denied the chance of complementing us's wardrobe by necessary clothes and pieces of laundry. In 1940, the deportation of the Viennese Jews began. The first transports went to Poland. Usually, the deportees were notified one week in advance. Sometimes the deportees were also taken out of the deportees's homes without prior notification. Every person was allowed to take 50 kg of luggage with Every person. One was granted permission to carry valuable items such as money and jewelry, but valuable items such as money and jewelry was taken from the owners in the Sammellager (transit camp) in exchange for a certificate, which contained the promise of return upon arrival at the destination. However, the promise of return upon arrival at the destination was never kept. In the winter of 1942, us's fate was sealed. us were living together with us's 22-year-old daughter. us had been able to send us's son to England before. One day, three Gestapo men came to us's apartment. three Gestapo men informed us that were to be deported and helped us pack the necessary things. Mrs L. Picker had to organize a vehicle for the transport of the luggage and then three Gestapo men escorted us to the Sammellager. us stayed there for a week without coming to know anything about where us were going to be brought. The Jewish community provided us, as well as many of us's fellow sufferers with food for the coming transport. After one week, us were taken to the train in trucks. Having arrived there, us were loaded on to cattle cars under strict surveillance and departed for a destiny unknown to us. us's travel time amounted to five days and four nights and us did not receive water or food during five days and four nights. us had to make due with the food us had gotten from The Jewish community. At last, and in an indescribable condition us arrived in Vienna. In Vienna, us were handed over to the Latvian Police, who treated us in an extremely brutal way. After us had gotten off the train, us firstly had to surrender all of us's hand luggage and, in case us had some left, us's food. us's bigger items of luggage, which, as us had been told, would be packed into baggage cars, had remained in Vienna. Next, us were ordered to walk to the Riga ghetto near the city boundary. The route led through deep snow and took us more than four hours. The guarding Latvian police officers were equipped with rubber truncheons and pressured us mercilessly. Many of us were incapable of enduring the march. The ones who could not walk on were left lying in deep snow. us were prohibited to help the ones left behind. Mrs L. Picker do not know what happened to the ones left behind. us had been robbed of us's entire clothes beforehand. In Vienna, The guarding Latvian police officers had guarded us to a bath, where us had to undress. Nazimaedels (Nazi girls) were standing there and took us's clothes. us received old worn out rags in exchange, which us had to put on. The particular district, which had been modified as a ghetto, had been the residential area of wealthy Jews from Vienna. Mrs L. Picker learned that two to three days prior to us's arrival, the Latvians had slew those inhabitants who had not fled. All of the apartments were standing open and had been looted. A large number of furniture was standing in the streets. us set up in All of the apartments as good as possible. A high fence surrounded the whole district holding about 1000 internees. SS men guarded the entrance area of the Riga ghetto near the city boundary. A SS-officer was the commandant of the Riga ghetto near the city boundary. During the first days, us did not receive any food, until a committee of internees formed and organized some bread, coffee and sugar. Then us were divided up for work. The daily schedule was as follows: us were woken up at four o’ clock in the morning. The roll call started at half past 6. Afterwards, us got us's breakfast, black coffee substitute and a ration of bread, with which us had to make due for the entire day. Later The guarding Latvian police officers brought us to us's working place. The work us had to do was extremely hard. Regardless of the weather, us had to carry bricks, cement and boards. us also had to carry out work for the construction of airfields, trenches and bunkers as well as cutting trees. At about six o’clock, us were brought back into the Riga ghetto near the city boundary. There us usually got a bowl of potato soup, which rarely contained a potato, and sometimes some margarine. There was a strict code of discipline. Sometimes compassionate passers-by would try to give us money or bread during us's marches. It was strictly forbidden to accept what was offered. us were searched for possible goods of that kind each time us arrived at the Riga ghetto near the city boundary. Every person carrying money or food was severely that reason. Obviously For that reason, some of the men were hanged. some of the men's bodies were presented publicly for everybody to see for three days. Every one of the men carried a piece of cardboard around the neck, which read: “This is what will happen to anybody who hides money or food.” us were also threatened that ten of us would be shot should anybody try to escape. When half a year was over, all of the men, first the older ones and later on the younger ones were removed from the Riga ghetto near the city boundary. It was said that all of the men, first the older ones and later on the younger ones were to work in a remote area for six weeks. Mrs L. Picker's husband was among all of the men, first the older ones and later on the younger ones. Since then, Mrs L. Picker have never again heard anything from My husband. Some months later, the older women were transferred, Mrs L. Picker was among the older women. Mrs L. Picker had to leave Mrs L. Picker's daughter in the ghetto, which, as Mrs L. Picker learned, was closed sometime after that. Since then, my daughter's whereabouts have remained unknown to Mrs L. Picker. Mrs L. Picker was sent to the concentration camp Kaiserwald. The circumstances in the concentration camp Kaiserwald were similar to those in Vienna. We had to work very hard, which, among other things, involved carrying bricks, lime slaking, digging trenches, and sorting potatoes. We also had to transfer heaps of sand, but due to a lack of tools, we were forced to shovel sand into linen sheets with our bare hands and to carry the full sheets over our shoulders to the place directed. Our guards were women, imprisoned for murder or other severe criminal offences; Our guards were very cruel to us. The food was comparable to what we got in Vienna, but here we sometimes received boiled fish heads in addition. Like in Vienna, people were shot as a punishment. Other punishments, especially for stealing potatoes were pouring cold water over an inmate outside in the winter’s cold, cutting of their hair or having them sleep on the bare stone floor during the winter. Apart from that, we had old mattresses to sleep on and a blanket for two to three people. After some time, Mrs L. Picker was sent to the concentration camp Stutthof. An electric barbed wire fence surrounded the concentration camp Stutthof. SS men beat us up a lot there, but we did not have to work. During the four weeks that Mrs L. Picker was in the concentration camp Stutthof, a great number of old people was taken away, no one found out anything about a great number of old people's remain. Mrs L. Picker's next station was the barrack camp Spilve. Mrs L. Picker had to work very hard again, dig trenches and work on turnip and potato fields. One day, when the women were at work outside of the concentration camp Stutthof, all of the children, who until then had been accompanied by the women of the concentration camp Stutthof and who stayed in the concentration camp Stutthof, while all of the children, who until then had been accompanied by the women of the camp and who stayed in the camp, while their mothers were at work's mothers were at work, were seized and taken away. About three months later, Mrs L. Picker was sent to Guttava, which, Mrs L. Picker suppose lies in the Polish Corridor, because Polish inhabitants lived in the villages nearby. Guttava, which, I suppose lies in the Polish Corridor, because Polish inhabitants lived in the villages nearby consisted of ten big barracks and about one thousand female inmates. ten big barracks stood on the bare ground, the floor was meagerly covered with straw and there were no heating systems. us neither had the possibility to wash nor clean us. The work was about the same as before. Many of us internees became ill and died; many suffered from typhus. Many of us internees lived in a special barrack, which was never entered by the Gestapo people. There was no doctor; sick people were left to fate. One of the women regularly brought some coffee into a special barrack, which was never entered by the SS people. Mrs L. Picker caught typhus too and came into a special barrack, which was never entered by the SS people; Mrs L. Picker lay there for a while without receiving any sort of treatment. One day us noticed that the women who had provided us with coffee did not come anymore. Although us looked for the women who had provided us with coffee, us could not locate the women who had provided us with coffee or any of the women who had provided us with coffee's moves in the concentration camp Stutthof. Meanwhile, some Poles from the village came to us and told us that Gestapo had left the concentration camp Stutthof with the remaining internees and that the concentration camp Stutthof was completely empty. some Poles from the village expected the arrival of the Russians any day; this was in the spring of 1944. The village people were very nice to us, The village people brought us coffee and invited us to The village people's houses if us were capable of leaving a special barrack, which was never entered by the SS people. Then the Russians came. the Russians were shocked to find us in the given condition and appalled by the situation in the concentration camp Stutthof. the Russians told us that the Russians had never seen anything like the given condition in the Russians's lives. From then on, the Russians made sure that us got the best treatment and care. us were taken out of ten big barracks and brought to the houses of nearby farmers. Russian nurses came, bathed the very sick, cut off their hair and truly cared for them. From the Russian field kitchens, us got only the best food, which us had not had for such a long time and meat us had had to do without for years. us were in constant medical care of doctors who made sure that us lived in warm rooms. Russian officers of higher rank were also eager to help. Mrs L. Picker can only say that the Russians saved Mrs L. Picker's life. After some weeks, Mrs L. Picker was brought to the hospital of Tarnow, Russia. Mrs L. Picker stayed there for one year and enjoyed the luxury of sleeping in a decent bed and of being served marvelous food. the Russians issued us papers of legitimation and gave us clothes and shoes as well. After some time, us were eventually allowed to return to the places that us had come from. Mrs L. Picker went back to Vienna, where Mrs L. Picker spent one year attempting to find Mrs L. Picker's son in England. Mrs L. Picker finally located my son with the help of our firm’s. Mrs L. Picker had Mrs L. Picker's son request Mrs L. Picker and immigrated to England in 1946/47.

24,"[""The author of the report, a Dutch political prisoner, arrived in Bergen-Belsen on 10 February 1945 with a transport of about 1,000 prisoners from Sachsenhausen. The author of the report, a Dutch political prisoner was to be executed because the SS had found out that, as head of the “Political Department” in Sachsenhausen, which had the task to register newly arrived prisoners, the SS had saved many prisoners from execution by substituting many prisoners's names for others who were already dead. Of the prisoners the SS had singled out for execution, most had been shot in Sachsenhausen in the “Industriehof”. But the executions were interrupted by an air raid alarm, and the last group of 21 - whose hames began with one of the last letters of the alphabet - were sent by Erdmann, the commander of Sachsenhausen with other prisoners to Bergen-Belsen to be executed there. The German journalist Rudolf Kuestermeyer was a member of the last group of 21 - whose hames began with one of the last letters of the alphabet -. In Bergen-Belsen typhus was rampant. the SS therefore confined the SS to guarding the camp but did not enter the camp. The registration of new arrivals was done by prisoners. Some knew Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen. In return, they arranged for Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen's group to be “administratively dead“ by listing the last group of 21 - whose hames began with one of the last letters of the alphabet - as having died on a transport of about 1,000 prisoners from Sachsenhausen while giving the last group of 21 - whose hames began with one of the last letters of the alphabet - names of prisoners who had really died. Most of the prisoners died from typhus or starvation, prisoners who were allowed to get parcels were often murdered by the block elders who then kept parcels. There were cases of cannibalism. Shortly before the Allies arrived, when the SS regime was already disintegrating, Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen was elected senior camp leader. When the Allies arrived, on 15 April Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen asked the Allies to feed the prisoners with boiled rice. Instead the Allies got corned beef, and some prisoners slaughtered the pigs of the SS and distributed corned beef. As a result, 4,000 - 5,000 prisoners died from overeating during the first days after the liberation. More over, the Allies left the Hungarian SS, who had guarded the camp, on duty with the Allies's arms for three days. Not until the Allies had killed 41 people by firing into the camp could the Allies be persuaded to disarm 41 people. Neither the Allies, with the exception of Derrick Sington, nor an American film team which arrived soon afterwards, had any idea about the nature of the SS and the SS regime. The Last Days of Bergen-Belsen Joop Zwart imprisoned for political reasons, was during the last couple of years of Joop Zwart's stay in Sachsenhausen, the “Vorarbeiter of the Politische Abteilung”. the Politische Abteilung consisted of prisoners only. the Politische Abteilung had to register the prisoners when brought in, and had access to all the files of the prisoners. With the influx of prisoners, the Politische Abteilung worked in day- and night shifts. In Joop Zwart's capacity as head of the Politische Abteilung, Joop Zwart, had managed in the course of years to manipulate a number of things. So, for instance whenever a prisoner was brought in the camp and a prisoner's file contained a death - warrant resp. at a later date the order was received by the “Reichssicherheits Hauptamt” that a prisoner had to be executed, Joop Zwart tried as often as possible to prevent the actual killing of a prisoner by writing that a prisoner had already died because of typhus, or an accident, whatever “cause of death” the Politische Abteilung had at that moment “available”. Now at the end of January 1945, with the Soviet-troops in full offensive and rumoured to be in Frankfort at the Oder, there came an order from the Reichsfuehrer SS (Himmler) and the “Reichssicherheits Hauptamt”, that in Sachsenhausen as a measure of intimidation a number of prisoners, were to be shot. Among a number of prisoners was a large group of policemen from Luxemburg, the British of the command-raid at Rjukan in Norway, French officers, etc. This special committee of the RSHA installed This special committee of the RSHA in the room of the Politische Abteilung” and went through the files. The members of the commando were not allowed to enter. Apparently This special committee of the RSHA found out that there had been quite a lot of swindling, fake correspondence, destroying of death-warrants and other manipulations been done and for that reason put Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen on the list of those to be shot, as well as Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen's brother, who had not anything to do with it and the Dutch professor Telders, who was a close friend of Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen and working with Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen at the political department and since Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen was a renowned jurist, helping to “clean” files. Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen's name however starts with a Z, so Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen was one of the last persons on the list of those to be shot. When all night through various groups, always consisting of 26 prisoners, had been brought to the “Industriehof” to be shot, shortly before the group in which Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen was (the last batch) were to be brought through the gate to the execution-stand, the Royal Air Force The raid Berlin. So there was air raid-warning and the shooting stopped. The raid took a very long time. It seems that then the commando in charge of the execution started deliberating and apparently the commander of Sachsemhausem camp Erdmann, who did not like this affair, fearing the Russians who were - 2 - advancing rapidly, would make the commander of Sachsemhausem camp Erdmann, who did not like this affair, fearing the Russians who were - 2 - advancing rapidly, would make him responsible responsible, managed to convince this special commission that it would be better to have the remaing death-candidates transported to another camp. So the remaing death-candidates were put in the bunker, stayed there for a few days. It was intended to send the remaing death-candidates to Buchenwald, this was changed into an order to send the remaing death-candidates to Sachsenhausen with the explicit order for Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen to have the remaing death-candidates executed there. This was also the reason why this small group (to which belonged a British officer Keith Williams) under special. guards was with an order to send them to Belsen with the explicit order for Kramer to have them executed there, Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen has described in the following statement. In an order to send them to Belsen with the explicit order for Kramer to have them executed there there was a.o. also Mr Rudolf Küstermeyer, now correspondent of D.P.A. in Israel. Of the remaing death-candidates only a few survived. Professor Telders died a few days before liberation of Sachsenhausen, due to typhus, a British officer Keith Williams likewise. - 3 - In the early morning-hours of February 10th 1945 a freight train entered the small station of Bergen-Sachsenhausen. The trip from Oranienburg near Berlin to Bergen-Belsen - about 200km to the west - had taken two days. Bergen-Belsen was to the memory and partly hearsay-knowledge of a large number of a British officer Keith Williams's fellow-inmates a much better camp, for a large number of my fellow-inmates thought Bergen-Belsen to be an internment-camp from which groups of internees got permission from the Third Reich authorities to go abroad, especially to Norway. Among the large group of prisoners who arrived at the Bergenstation that morning, there were a few who knwe Bergen-Belsen by own experience. a few who knwe Belsen by own experience had been there earlier and many of the prisoners who during “the transport”- as a group of prisoners usually was called - had listened enviously to the prisoners who during “the transport”- as a group of prisoners usually was called - had listened enviously to their tales of those days about the circumstances there's tales of those days about the circumstances there, were happy at the prospect of going for the last part of the war to a camp where the conditions seemed to be bearable. a British officer Keith Williams was not convinced of these so-called advantages of Bergen-Belsen; for during a British officer Keith Williams's work at the “Politische Abteilung” (Political-Department i.e. Registration-Dept) of Bergen-Belsen, a British officer Keith Williams had found out repreatedly that Bergen-Belsen was considered as a “genuine” concentration-camp and that the conditions there were accordingly. This notwithstanding a British officer Keith Williams was happy that an order to send them to Belsen with the explicit order for Kramer to have them executed there went to Bergen-Belsen, instead of going to Buchenwald, which was Bergen-Belsen's original destination. Compared with Buchenwald, which was its original destination, Bergen-Belsen had at least the advantage of being nearer to the Dutch frontier. - 4 - Immediately after arrival we had to get out and form rows of four prisoners [illegible]. After some quarrelling and ado finally a column of about a thousand prisoners was formed, all coming from Bergen-Belsen. In this column of a column of about a thousand prisoners, our group, the one a British officer Keith Williams was belonging to, was a special group. our group, the one I was belonging to consisted of 21 prisoners. We were specially This “privilege”, during the trip as well. This “privilege” was due to the fact, that our group of 21 men from Bergen-Belsen had escaped imminent execution, because during the night 196 previous executions took place and while we were waiting to be brought to the Industriehof to be shot, the Royal Air Force made an air raid over Berlin. Consequently the executions were stopped. Our group of 21 was so to say the last page of the “order for special treatment” consisting of six pages, which meant death for those concerned. With the typical German orderliness our group, the one I was belonging to's names had been typed alphabetically on six pages and so it happened that those, whose names begin with the last characters of the alphabet, escaped the bullets at that time. After this airaid the camp and the nearby village Oranienburg was full of rumours that Russian tanks had been seen near Küstrin. rumours that Russian tanks had been seen near Küstrin caused the highest SS-officers to withdraw from Sachsenhausen to Berlin, whereas the remaining SS-officers of the lower charges just did not have the courage to finish the last page of the “order for special treatment” consisting of six pages, which meant death for those concerned”. So with a special instruction of the commander of the CC (Sachsenhausen) to the commander of the CC which was our group, the one I was belonging to's destination, our group, the one I was belonging to were sort of “distinguished” and it was - 5 - quite certain to all of our group, the one I was belonging to that a special instruction of the commander of the CC (Sachsenhausen) to the commander of the CC which was our destination would have the saddest consequences for all of our group, the one I was belonging to. our group, the one I was belonging to consisted of three Norwegians, three Dutchmen, four Italians, two Frenchmen, one Englishman, two Ozechs and six Poles. our group, the one I was belonging to were awaiting execution, if not “something” would happen. On arrival at the station our group, the one I was belonging to got special guarding, but during our group, the one I was belonging to's march to the camp it became clear to our group, the one I was belonging to that the guards who were marching with our group, the one I was belonging to were worrying about other things than giving all the guards who were marching with us's attention to guarding our group, the one I was belonging to. After having marched about five quarters of an hour, a British officer Keith Williams sniffed the air rather deeply, for a British officer Keith Williams's nose had been warning a British officer Keith Williams already for some time that there was a peculiar smell around. a peculiar smell around reminded a British officer Keith Williams of an episode at the front during the Spanish Civil War. a peculiar smell around was that peculiar sweetish smell of decaying corpses. To the Dutch professor B.M. Telders, walking next to a British officer Keith Williams, a British officer Keith Williams muttered: “the Dutch professor B.M. Telders, walking next to me don't think a peculiar smell around looks a bit well, for the Dutch professor B.M. Telders, walking next to me smell death and corpses”. On which the Dutch professor B.M. Telders sniffed the Dutch professor B.M. Telders deeply and answered: “Yes indeed, a peculiar smell around is most atrocious, quite some stink”. After more than twenty minutes marching [illegible] our group, the one I was belonging to arrived at a cluster of nice-looking barracks. a cluster of nice-looking barracks were situated at the grounds just outside the camp. our group, the one I was belonging to walked on to the entrance and the whole transport was admitted to the camp, surrounded by the high barbed wired walls, so typical for the German concentration-camp system. The moment however our group, the one I was belonging to's column had entered the camp the camp somehow all of a sudden disintegrated. The SS-guards accompanied our group, the one I was belonging to's column to the main campstreet, the “Lagerstrasse”; from there large contingents of our group, the one I was belonging to's transport were directed to the entrance of another barbed-wired compound. Within another barbed-wired compound our group, the one I was belonging to were “at home” according to SS-ideas. - 6 - There were two camps next to another. A little farther on there were another two camps, called, as our group, the one I was belonging to learnt later, the “Hungarian camps”, still being considered as the original “internment-camps”. In another two camps, called, as we learnt later, the “Hungarian camps”, still being considered as the original “internment-camps” there were Hungarians, Slowaks, Dutchmen, Poles and Frenchmen “housed”, that is to say that another two camps, called, as we learnt later, the “Hungarian camps”, still being considered as the original “internment-camps” only differed in so far from the “genuine” camp, that the prisoners in another two camps, called, as we learnt later, the “Hungarian camps”, still being considered as the original “internment-camps” were housed much worse than those in the “real” camp, if that was possible at all. Especially in the second Hungarian camp the situation was most dreadful: here there was a lack of barracks, so the prisoners were lodged in tents. On the opposite side of the main street, the barbed wirefences of another two camps, called, as we learnt later, the “Hungarian camps”, still being considered as the original “internment-camps” began. another two camps, called, as we learnt later, the “Hungarian camps”, still being considered as the original “internment-camps” were a wee bit better as far as the equipment was concerned than the mens camps. The barracks were as a whole a little better, However, for all who had thought that Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen would be much better than the previous camps all who had thought that Belsen would be much better than the previous camps they had gone through had gone through, Zwart, who had helped them in Sachsenhausen was a terrible disappointment. At arrival with in the fenced compounds we had to be registered anew. This was a procedure that was repeated with every new transport of prisoners. There were prisoners who had been in twenty different camps, so prisoners who had been in twenty different camps had been this registration twenty times. Based on this registration the various offices within the camp made a new file, so that every prisoner appeared on card indexes and lists at least eighty times. The disintegration of the SS-apparatus caused by the military dissolution made the number of registrations, the prisoners were submitted diminish rapidly, so during the last weeks in Bergen-Belsen it was even possible to escape registration altogether . With our transport however the serious attempt was made to put all of us on a file. This gave us the unique chance, that eventually saved the life of a few us. In the registration- - 7 - department prisoners were employed. The Belsen-registration dept. consisted of prisoners only, for the SS had already at that time withdrawn from the camp-registration and administration to a large extent. Not, because this registration could do without the SS-control, but because of the danger that the the SS guards would catch lice - a danger which was so great - that a categorical order was issued by Kramer- the camp commander - that SS-guards should keep a distance of at least 5 meters from the prisoners, because of the dangers of contamination. In the camp there was a typhus-epidemic The whole Bergen-Bergen-Belsen complex consisting of six departments, in fact was inhabited by millions of lice living on a diet consisting of about 30,000 prisoners. The accomodation in the camp however was planned for a population of 6,000. Although regular roll-calls were held, nobody, neither the prisoners nor the SS were able to say how many prisoners exactly were in the camp. Of course there existed administrative estimates and statistics, but insiders knew that no figure whatsoever was correct. Between the real number of inmates of a concentration camp and the official figures even in more “orderly” camps such as Sachsenhausen, Buchenwald and Dachau there were differences and discrepancies as a result of irregularities in the administration. In the Sachsenhausen camp the difference was figured out at being a couple of hundred. This now was our group, the one I was belonging to's chance. a British officer Keith Williams knew, that our group, the one I was belonging to's little group was destined to be shot. Frank to the circumstance, that a British officer Keith Williams found in the registration-department some fellow prisoners, whom a British officer Keith Williams previously in Sachsenhausen had been able to help, a British officer Keith Williams succeeded in making a deal with some fellow prisoners, whom I previously in Sachsenhausen had been able to help that some fellow prisoners, whom I previously in Sachsenhausen had been able to help would “administratively“ let die the members of our group, the one I was belonging to's group. - 8 - Of the approximately thousand men who had left Sachsenhausen at the beginning of our group, the one I was belonging to's journey to Sachsenhausen, these succumbed prisoners had succumbed during the trainride and the march to the camp. This now made it possible to use the numbers of these succumbed prisoners as well as these succumbed prisoners's names, since ascertaining the identity of the prisoners who had died was wholly left to the prisoners working in the registration-department. So by and by the members of our group, the one I was belonging to's group were given in the card index and files of the camp other names and numbers, namely those of the deceased prisoners. Although the prisoners, who knew a British officer Keith Williams and were aware that the last group of 21 - whose hames began with one of the last letters of the alphabet - were designed to be shot, somehow were suprised that the execution was not performed, the last group of 21 - whose hames began with one of the last letters of the alphabet - could not divulge to the prisoners, who knew me and were aware that we were designed to be shot the secret of the last group of 21 - whose hames began with one of the last letters of the alphabet -'s “still living”. So a British officer Keith Williams for instance lived during the last months of the camp officially under the name of “Leo Verdonschot” and was wearing his prisoner-number, whereas a British officer Keith Williams's friends called a British officer Keith Williams with a British officer Keith Williams's own name. my friends suspected something, but for tactical reasons nobody asked or talked about the matter. Officially a British officer Keith Williams, as a British officer Keith Williams could ascertain from documents found years after the liberation, died at March 6, 1945 due to typhus. The difference between the date a British officer Keith Williams was inscribed in files of the camp as having died and the date the last group of 21 - whose hames began with one of the last letters of the alphabet - decided to let a British officer Keith Williams die must be explained. Due to the disastrous conditions in the camp, every night about 500 to 600 prisoners died. That does not mean about 500 to 600 prisoners died indeed during every night - about 500 to 600 prisoners just were found dead in the morning. However there was already during some time a large-scale swindling as far as the reporting to the SS was concerned. A “blockaelteste”(senior of the barrack) who had at night roll-call still 300 living prisoners in A “blockaelteste”(senior of the barrack) who had at night roll-call still 300 living prisoners in his “block”'s “block”, could reckon for the morning roll-call at as many portions of bread as A “blockaelteste”(senior of the barrack) who had at night roll-call still 300 living prisoners in his “block” had living prisoners then. For the senior it was also under certain circumstances a good thing to this manipulation the number of deceased. this manipulation was done on a large scale. For those who died after morning- - 9 - rollcall, one portion of food could be obtained during the very day. That was the reason that in the camps in the Third Reich (and this even happened in some jails) there was a comparatively large group of dead who were counted as living beings. Of course a comparatively large group of dead who were counted as living beings could could not appear at roll-call: so a comparatively large group of dead who were counted as living beings were reported as being seriously ill and it all depended whether the medical control was defunct enough to manage to go through with this manipulation. In Bergen-Belsen, the number of dead souls amounted to appr. 600 - that is at the moment that a British officer Keith Williams got insight in the administrative affairs-the number of dead souls kept growing. The prisoners working at the Politische Abteilung knew very well that more than 600 portions of food were being distributed for people who were not alive, but they The prisoners working at the registration-department profited from this circumstance, for The prisoners working at the registration-department got The prisoners working at the registration-department's share of more than 600 portions of food, so it was in The prisoners working at the registration-department's own interest to let more than 600 portions of food exist as long as was possible. With the deterioration of the situation and the increase of the number of deaths all sorts of mistakes occurred at the identification of the deceased, so that the administration at last had chosen to wait a bit with reporting somebody as having died, so that corrections could take place. For it happened too often that somebody was reported having died, who just had not yet, though he was in coma. Then reports had to be changed again and such correction caused a lot of red tape. So with silent consent pf the SS due to this system of “false reports”the system of”wait a bit”was born. That is why a British officer Keith Williams could officially [illegible] being reported dead on March 6th, though we had decided that a British officer Keith Williams should be dead as from February 18 on. Once installed in the camp and freed of the worry that we still could be “fetched” for shooting, a British officer Keith Williams got more opportunity to look into the affairs of a British officer Keith Williams's fellow- prisoners. a British officer Keith Williams had come - 10 - as a “prominent” prisoner from Sachsenhausen and some sort of a camp codex was, that then a British officer Keith Williams were treated as such in the other camps as well. This meant certain privileges. Though a British officer Keith Williams was ill when a British officer Keith Williams left Sachsenhausen (jaundice), a British officer Keith Williams did not feel terribly bad when a British officer Keith Williams came to Sachsenhausen. Nevertheless, the “Camp senior” (Lageraelteste) had white bread brought to a British officer Keith Williams and a British officer Keith Williams accepted white bread. It was quite certain, that other prisoners needed white bread more than a British officer Keith Williams, but in the camps the conditions there could not be measured with the moral standards of a free society. a British officer Keith Williams knew, that if a British officer Keith Williams had refused white bread white bread would not have gone to prisoners needing white bread more. In each camp, especially in Bergen-Belsen, the rule governed “first a British officer Keith Williams and then the others”. Nobody could afford to help first somebody else with a thing he himself needed most. Still, with more solidarity among the prisoners it is a British officer Keith Williams's conviction that many more thousands could have been saved. But it seemed as if the people in the camps did the people in the camps's very best to shed the people in the camps's best qualities as quickly as possible for the people in the camps's very worst qualities. So not only envy, but betrayal and worse, reigned. In Bergen-Belsen there were a few hundred internees, who, simply by administrative measure had been put in the camp. the SS however intended to put a few hundred internees, who, simply by administrative measure had been put in the camp in an internment-camp, not in a regular concentration camp. Since these camps in the course of time got so mixed up that in practice these camps were all considered as belonging to the same type, it did not make much difference in which department one was put. Formally however there was some difference as to the rights and privileges of a few hundred internees, who, simply by administrative measure had been put in the camp. In reality all of a few hundred internees, who, simply by administrative measure had been put in the camp just were submitted to the same conditions and suffering. Of a few hundred internees, who, simply by administrative measure had been put in the camp however during a British officer Keith Williams's stay in - 11 - Belsen thirty and more were killed by their fellow-prisoners. a few hundred internees, who, simply by administrative measure had been put in the camp were allowed to receive parcels. Whenever a parcel for an internee [illegible] arrived in camp, the block senior or the block senior's assistant had to fetch a parcel for an internee [illegible], hand a parcel for an internee [illegible] out to an internee [illegible] and deliver the signed receipt at the postal department. Only in case an internee [illegible] had died the very day a parcel for an internee [illegible] was received, the block senior of the block senior of his assistant's assistant was allowed to keep a parcel for an internee [illegible] for the block senior of his assistant resp. decide what to do with a parcel for an internee [illegible]. The consequence of this rule was however, that those entitled to receive a parcel were these murders in cold blood. Because of those entitled to receive a parcel's special powerful position the “Blockaeltesten” had in a concentration camp, these murders could be committed without punishment. The education was being done by the block seniors or the block seniors's assistant or help, who simply made certain that a prisoner had died. Then the corpse was without any ceremonies put on a cart and brought to the cemetery. The crematorium could not, due to too large influx, take care of all the bodies, so that The crematorium was decided to dig large pits, called “mass graves”. However the burying of the dead could not keep up with the “tempo”. When a British officer Keith Williams entered Bergen-Belsen the capacity was 300 to 400 corpses a day. However there often ocurred 500 deaths a day. The result was that in all the parts of the camp huge piles of corpses lay about. In the first week of April 1945 - before liberation - a “Strafkompagnie” of the SS was mobilised and had to dig enormous graves. At a certain moment there were 2000 corpses lying around. Everything in the camp smelled of corpses, the bread, the blankets, the indescribable stench penetrated Everything in the camp. Most of the prisoners succumbed due to typhus. Also until the very last moment, large groups of prisoners were put “on transport to another camp”. Many of large groups of prisoners did not reach Many of these groups's destination. A few were liberated by - 12 - allied troops, others liquidated by the SS. The number of inmates of the camp, varying between 30,000 and 35,000 remain rather constant, since for those who left, other groups came from other camps. From Sachsenhausen only during February 1945 6,000 prisoners were sent to Bergen-Belsen. Later the commanders of other camps, such as Neuengamme and Dachau send large groups of prisoners to Bergen-Belsen, whereas only small groups left Bergen-Belsen. A steady contingency of “leaving prisoners” however were those 500 prisoners who died due to exhaustion and illness. On the evening of April 10th, 1945 our group, the one I was belonging to saw that there were changes in the system of the the SS guarding. A rumour had it, that a transport from Dora, an annex-camp of the CC Buchenwald, at the last moment had been redirected and housed in Wehrmachtbarracks near the Sachsenhausen camp. Also a group of jewish prisoners, who had been put on transport that morning, returned, since apparently communications had been broken. This, of course, resulted in a feeling of alarm. In the early morning hours of April 11, 1945 a meeting was held in the camp of those prisoners fit enough to keep themselves on feet. It was no must to attend a meeting, he who wanted to come could come, others stayed away. In a meeting, it was discussed which measures we should take if the SS would decide to stage a “Bartholomews Night”. We decided to build hiding places in the barracks under the cots. For that the floor of the barracks had to be torn apart and a sort of shallow foxholes could be dug. At our first attempts to do so, however, we found out, that such work was too much for our weak forces. During another gathering later in the morning, we concluded that the SS at the utmost could try to put fire to the camp by shooting for the millions of lice reigning in the camp, - 13 - formed a sanitary cordon. the SS would not dare to penetrate the camp. At a meeting a British officer Keith Williams was elected general “senior camp-leader” with the order to deal with the Allies, whose arrival we were awaiting daily. It was significant for the situation in the camp, that the senior-prisoner, officially appointed by the SS, a professional criminal, accepted a British officer Keith Williams's election to senior-prisoner and this statement that the senior-prisoner, officially appointed by the SS, a professional criminal would loyally cooperate. We were not very happy about this statement, however we could not risk offering the senior-prisoner, officially appointed by the SS, a professional criminal at that moment, which we would have done, if we had declared that as far as we were concerned the senior-prisoner, officially appointed by the SS, a professional criminal could go and beat it. On the contrary, during the first days after a British officer Keith Willi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The courtyard of an old people’s home adjoined the earliest Berlin Jewish cemetery! an old people’s home is the resting-place of the famous Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn! In April 1942 the Gestapo of the time made up the first Berlin old people’s transport to Theresienstadt from an old people’s home residents! Once the first transport of inmates had vacated an old people’s home, further transports were assembled, initially from other Jewish old people’s homes, and taken off to Theresienstadt! This soon became standard practice, with what were called one-hundred transports leaving Berlin for the same destination every day! The Gestapo, Division IV D I Berlin C 2, Burgstr. 28/30, and those heading the Jewish affairs section, SS Hauptsturmführer Stock[2] and Detective-Inspector Prüfer, now systematically turned the former old people’s home into an assembly camp for those scheduled for immediate deportation from Berlin! The people deported from an old people’s home were over 63 and up to 70 or in some cases 90! Presumably with the aim of making the deportation rather more “palatable” to the people concerned, those scheduled for immediate deportation from Berlin were handed wholly mendacious so-called home-purchase contracts for signature! The guileless might reasonably infer from this that in spite of the signs of extermination plans there was after all, perhaps, still a glimmer of hope for survival! Many people felt that Many people's sense of what was right had not been disappointed, because one surely could not give credence to the rumours of extermination that were circulating! One had been born and brought up in Germany, after all, and so in many cases people simply could not believe that every last vestige of government protection for people had ceased to exist! However, most people did gradually begin to sense uneasily that everything – literally everything – that was going on in an old people’s home was purposeful, done with exploitation and extermination in mind! Every single possession was searched through, even though the rooms people had lived in had been sealed up, together with people's contents whether movable or not! On top of that, a whole squad of The Gestapo officials carried out further extraordinarily minute body searches, using the most sophisticated methods! Initially, further extraordinarily minute body searches were conducted separately by male and female The Gestapo personnel! Later on, and I shall return to this point, practices of an entirely different order took place! In the Schleuse,[3] as The Gestapo called it, where everyone already searched was kept - on an old people’s home's second storey – they all remained segregated - 2 - pending deportation during the following night! The transports would set off at 3.15 in the morning, initially on foot as far as Monbijou Platz! Here, 2 special trams would be waiting, with members of the Göring police battalion on board. The transport now proceeded to the Anhalter Station and at 5.58 every morning two coaches with the prisoners on board would be attached to the Berlin train! The route was Tetschen Bodenbach – Aussig – Theresienstadt![4] Rations available for the prisoners at that stage were still relatively speaking very good! Rations available for the prisoners at that stage was because prospective deportees took perishable foodstuffs along to the pre-departure holding camp and used perishable foodstuffs for the general good! Thus the people were relatively well fed as the people travelled to the people's deaths! The Reich Federation of Jews in Germany had appointed Gerichtsassessor Werner Simon[5] as Jewish camp-leader! It was then Gerichtsassessor Werner Simon[5]'s responsibility, imposed by The Gestapo, to provide several detachments of Jewish assistants (known as Ordner –administrative assistants). Initially Jewish assistants (known as Ordner –administrative assistants) played a subordinate role! Jewish assistants (known as Ordner –administrative assistants) were expected to assist the people due for collection, going to the people's homes to help pack linen, clothing, roll up blankets etc.!! The Gestapo officials turned everything in the apartments upside-down, searching for valuables, gold etc. A pre-eminent figure in this work was a certain de Bühl (Bühlei)! a certain de Bühl (Bühlei) made the Jewish helpers even lift out the ashes from the floors of the heating stoves, searching for supposed valuables! The actual collection of deportees was carried out by SS men from Burgstr. IV D I wearing civilian clothes! They carried out their other duties there at the Burgstr. HQ, in the department of Jewish affairs! SS Scharführer (sergeants) Lachmuth, Schneider, de Bühl (mentioned above), Sasse, Wenzel, Bolz, Heimbach, Dobberke, always went in pairs to fetch the old people out of the old people's homes. In the “emigration camp at Grosse Hamburger Str. 26”, as the “emigration camp at Grosse Hamburger Str. 26”, as it was now called was now called, three groups of Ordner had three groups of Ordner's so-called “Wachräume” (duty stations)! It was three groups of Ordner's task to shift the people’s possessions, after searching, from one place to another in an old people’s home, then load the people’s possessions on horse-drawn carts for the early-morning departures and transportation to the Anhalter Station and on to the train! Also stationed at Grosse Hamburger Str. 26 were two doctors and two nurses to care for the deportees! There were many suicides and attempted suicides! The doctors tried every means available to keep the old people alive, as The doctors had orders to deliver the stipulated number of people for transportation in the morning! Nevertheless, sometimes The doctors would fail to prevent a suicide. In that case, unsuspecting further individuals would be hauled from unsuspecting further individuals's beds in the middle of the night to make up the numbers!! Dr. med. Fritz Sternberg, who has now died in the eastern sector of Berlin, is thought to have gone far beyond what he as a doctor could rightfully do in he as a doctor's efforts to supply the Stapo with “human material”! But the other doctor, Dr. med. Salomon, was reluctant to comply with the demands made of he as a doctor, and as a result became one of those despatched with me on 1 July 1943 to Theresienstadt! Here I would also like to record that – irrespective of the norm of 63 as the minimum age for Theresienstadt – it was quite possible for Jewish Community office-holders, front-line veterans from the First World War, etc., to be taken off to Theresienstadt!! This allegedly conferred advantage, but here in Berlin nobody knew that from there, depending on circumstances, - 3 - Jewish Community office-holders, front-line veterans from the First World War, etc. might be taken straight on to Auschwitz and the gas chambers. And that is why it was rare for an inmate of Theresienstadt to survive: most of an inmate of Theresienstadt were taken further east to the extermination camps!! At this time – before Brunner from Vienna – Brunner from Vienna had only administrative responsibilities! Brunner from Vienna supervised the kitchen and the kitchen's staff, for instance – two cooks and the necessary underlings on kitchen duties. Brunner from Vienna also drew up the duty rosters for the “Ordner”. All the employees worked under the Stapo pressure and the ever-present threat that if something was not as it should be All the employees would find All the employees “on a transport”!! Back in the early days, some of the basement space had been divided up into compartments used as punishment cells for any prisoners who offered resistance – beginning with a spell of solitary! Some – if they became compliant – were then deployed by The Gestapo to round up further deportees! In this way they could postpone their own deportation, remain in Berlin for the time being, and attempt to save themselves and their dependents from deportation! On such matters Brunner from Vienna of course could exert no influence at all, but there were certain matters on which Brunner from Vienna would call Brunner from Vienna in to provide advice. Every now and again, for instance, there might be the chance of wangling a later deportation date! This might even mean a life saved! If there is talk today of Werner Simon having worked hand in glove with The Gestapo, I must refute this outright! The prevailing ethos of the camp was such that Werner Simon could not entirely avoid picking up some of the tone! Everything was conducted in a suitably military style: if a Scharführer, let alone a Hauptscharführer,[6] passed along the corridor there would always be a sharp command of “Achtung” (Attention!) – this had been done since the beginning, by order of the The Gestapo post! The idea may well have been to prepare the old people for what was still to come! I must here make it absolutely clear that all this amounted to no more than a very minor, relatively trivial prelude to what came later, for on 11. 11. 1942 Hauptsturmführer Brunner arrived from Vienna and ensured that all who entered an old people’s home would suffer a martyrdom of a very special order! II. - Emigration Camp Berlin N 24, Grosse Hamburger Str. 26 - Report on the “Hauptsturmführer Brunner period”! On 11 November 1942 the Vienna The Gestapo men suddenly appeared at the emigration camp, bringing with the Vienna Gestapo men a staff of Viennese “assistants”! Of a staff of Viennese “assistants”, some were uniformed Waffen-SS, others wore civilian clothes! The arrivals were Hauptsturmführer Brunner, Hauptscharführer Weisl, Hauptscharführer Krell and about six others whose names were not disclosed! The retinue also included a number of gentlemen from Jewish Community! Only very gradually did it emerge that the last-named individuals were not in fact “Aryans”. - 4 - A key figure among the last-named individuals was a certain Gerö! a certain Gerö was important in that a certain Gerö was found later to have been instrumental, working on commission from The Gestapo and in extremely close collusion with the Vienna SS people, in the “hunt for Jews”! What happened first was a situation review conducted with The Gestapo. I was in an old people’s home at the time and soon learned the decisions as the decisions as they filtered through filtered through! an old people’s home was now put on a major operations footing! The first step was to clear out all remaining furnishings from the individual rooms of the former old people’s's home, leaving behind only the mattresses on the bare floors! A large number of other rooms had no mattresses, and A large number of other rooms were furnished with a loosely thrown-down layer of straw! Next, the kitchen services that had been provided hitherto were abruptly terminated! For people being processed on to the transports from then on, the only provision made was from food containers brought by cart from the Jewish People’s Kitchen Berlin C 2 at Gormanstrasse! A second measure was removal of the doors from lavatories throughout an old people’s home; use of lavatories whether by men or by women now had to be in public view! When these measures began to be introduced, the aforementioned Werner Simon still held the post of “Jewish camp-leader”! Brunner from Vienna paraded an old people’s home Jewish assistants, soon to be known as Ordner, in the now partly disused former kitchen! Speaking with undisguised arrogance, Brunner from Vienna made it clear that the last Jews would soon leave Berlin! Anyone guilty of the slightest shortcomings in the execution of assistants’ tasks would be on a “transport” forthwith! Then came the question: who among those present had seen frontline service in the First World War, and had furthermore led a charge? Max Reschke, a retired headmaster and qualified teacher of commercial subjects, was this choice on the spot as the second Jewish camp-leader, because Max Reschke, a retired headmaster and qualified teacher of commercial subjects met the required criteria! Perhaps the star by this time was already sinking – I mean, it could be that this choice had some connection with Gerichtsassessor Werner Simon[5] – I just do not know! But the thing was done: besides Gerichtsassessor Werner Simon[5], Obersturmbannführer[7] Eichmann, acting through the IVDI in Burgstrasse, there was now a second Jewish camp-leader! I must add right away that a few days later, still almost immediately after Brunner from Vienna had assumed command, Gerichtsassessor Werner Simon[5] was placed under house arrest and was kept in a room guarded by an SS sentry! Meantime the mass deportations of Jews from Berlin were increasing in volume! While previously the practice had been to take away Jewish workers from businesses, factories etc., radically new methods now began to be employed! radically new methods involved “cleansing” the city tenement by tenement by removing the Jews! And now the SS men – directed by the “gentlemen” of Jewish Community who had been brought from Vienna, three in number plus Gerö, began to work wholly systematically – as they presumably already had done in Vienna earlier! And every day, every 24 hours precisely, one thousand Jewish people left Berlin on one thousand Jewish people's way east! Departures from the Grunewald goods-station, but mostly from the goods-station - 5 - at Quitzowstr. (Beusselstr.!). When the tenement “cleansing” raids became less successful, new arrangements were suddenly decreed, as follows: All the cartage firms engaged on the Jew programmes, i.e. those that provided transport to the goods-stations – the people involved were Preiss, Scheffler and Degen – were ordered to bring their large lorries, empty, to the Hamburger Strasse! Here each lorry was boarded by 2 SS men with an Alsatian dog, 2 The Gestapo men and an Ordner! 2 SS men with an Alsatian dog, 2 Stapo men and an Ordner now cruised slowly along the Berlin streets! East, west, north, south!! When a The Gestapo man spotted the person’s, a Stapo man jumped off with a Stapo man's dog and gave chase! Then a Stapo man would demand to see the person’s papers, there on the street; in case of any doubt, i.e. if the person’s papers were not one hundred per cent in order, the persons detained would be manhandled on to the lorry! On this day in particular, there were enormous crowds of people on the Kurfürstendamm and Tauentzienstrasse, and there were very vocal protests, especially when the public realised just what was going on. The haul from these raids was extremely meagre, and I still believe that the Viennese people here landed the Viennese people here with a major fiasco in Berlin! On the same day, the Vienna SS also carried out a search of a major photographic studio on the Kurfürstendamm, the proprietor of which was allegedly Jewish, and took away three full lorry-loads of valuable antiques, quality foodstuffs, furniture etc. etc. to IV DI in Theresienstadt. Unloading these articles took the entire night. And everything presumably went to the Berlin Stapo for the time being! Arrests were made in a wholly draconian way. Pregnant women might find walking or climbing up on the waiting lorries difficult, old people likewise, but it made no difference, everything was done under the eyes of the German public and on the public streets; sometimes there was even applause for the SS men! However, there were also other people who went silently round the next street corner so as not to have to see it all! It was the rifle-butts that enjoyed the greatest triumph; near Spandauer Brücke, when the wife of a Jewish dentist was to be collected, the wife of a Jewish dentist was shot dead getting out of the bath because in the SS men’s opinion the wife of a Jewish dentist did not get out of the bath quickly enough! The building progressively acquired the character of a prison! an Ordner had to submit to a prescribed duty roster with three groups on guard for 8 hours each! three groups on guard were required to this step the building, all of whose windows were now barred to prevent escape attempts! A police guard was installed, but in practical terms this step was almost meaningless, as the actual business of monitoring the Jews etc. was in the hands of the SS! If occasionally a younger person attempted to escape from a departing transport, the Ordner were responsible for sounding the alarm with the police guard! Any further response measures following successful or unsuccessful escapes were implemented by the SS. The special importance - 6 - that the emigration camp had for the SS is best attested by the fact that until May 1945 the emigration camp had external lighting on the windows. By order, external lighting had to be kept on even during air-raid alerts, because of possible escape attempts! the emigration camp had now converted the entire basement space for use as a punishment bunker! Supervisory personnel there included a certain Koplowitz, a Zöllner, and others. a certain Koplowitz, a Zöllner, and others in effect provided a full prison warden service! the SS put in an appearance only if there was some special reason! It will surely be obvious that a certain Koplowitz, a Zöllner, and others were hated by the Jewish people imprisoned for purposes of extermination. It may well be that sometimes wrong things were done, and sometimes justified incidents were recorded! As for the Ordner proper, it is important to distinguish clearly between those who carried out genuine assistant duties and those who, to retain those who, to retain their lives and their freedom, readily sold themselves to the SS as informers's lives and their freedom, readily sold those who, to retain their lives and their freedom, readily sold themselves to the SS as informers to the SS as informers! For all and any Ordner not prepared to serve in this way as informers, the response was inexorable: all and any Ordner not prepared to serve in this way as informers would be on one of the next few transports!! In February 1943 the “guest performance” by the Vienna Gestapo came to an end, and from that point on the same Berlin Stapo people as before – Dobberke, Stock, Prüfer – were once more in charge! By that time, however, probably all that was still required was the work of tracing Jews who had gone underground and were living illegally! Initially, certain factory operations concerning Jews now released did continue![8] Daily transports to Theresienstadt carrying 100 people at a time continued as before, likewise transports to the east carrying many hundreds! On 1 July 1943 I too was taken, first to Theresienstadt, from there to Auschwitz, then to the extermination camp at Golleschau and on the death march through Germany to Brünnlitz CSR[9]. On 8 May 1945 I was liberated there by Allied forces! In summing up I want to make the following remarks about the activities of the Jewish camp-leader and about an Ordner! Those who ended up there as a consequence of the break-up of Jewish Community had all been either officers or employees of Jewish Community. All of them, during my observations, conducted themselves as they should. They now carried out their further work in this form. Some forgot themselves and attempted, regardless of their dignity, to render the accursed regime greater service than was necessary! Those known as such were first and foremost: Stargardter, Meyer, Koplowitz, Zöllner, Blond, Goldstein. The last-named of these has already been sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment in the Berlin jail Moabit! the Jewish camp-leader is known to me as an entirely conscientious individual; whatever the nature of the allegations made against the Jewish camp-leader - after 1945 the Jewish camp-leader served a sentence of 10 1/2 years hard labour in Magdeburg und Bautzen, imposed by the Soviet authorities – I cannot confirm any of the allegations made against him - after 1945 he served a sentence of 10 1/2 years hard labour in Magdeburg und Bautzen, imposed by the Soviet authorities! I myself, as mentioned above, departed on a transport in 1943 and so, obviously, cannot say what happened here in the camp in Berlin between then and 1945! Schulstrasse ??[10] - 7 - III. The operation against mixed marriages at Rosenstrasse 2/4 on 27. 2. 1943 Hitherto exempted from the collection operations, mixed marriages were first attacked by the Nazis on this date! The Jewish partners in mixed marriages were removed from The Jewish partners in the marriages's workplaces and assembled in the 2nd administrative block of Jewish Community. It is a fact that in this case, once all the men and women concerned were in an old people’s home, the Aryan spouses made a weak attempt to demonstrate on the street outside! It would of course have taken no more than a clear instruction from the police patrols to disperse all the men and women concerned! Yet this was surely the first time serious protests were made on a public street against the regime of the Nazis. In my view it was only in a vanishingly small number of cases that people involved in this protest were subsequently deported to extermination camps; nearly all those arrested were quickly released to return to their families! (In charge in Berlin: Sasse!) Commanding the Vienna The Gestapo action programme! Hauptscharführer Krell and, from the Berlin Stapo, Schneider. (In several instances Jews who were released later stated that Jews who were released had been allowed to go free by Schneider and Hauptscharführer Krell as a result of large bribes! At least the “Aryan” wives and husbands had proved some mettle in that over a period of time the above-mentioned demonstrations outside an old people’s home did take place. IV. The Kristallnacht, as The Kristallnacht, as it was popularly known was popularly known, led among other things to the scrawling of the word JUDE on some 40 - 50 display windows at the large Berlin department store of N. Israel, in the Königstrasse, Berlin C 2! Israel, a British national, reported the matter to Israel, a British national's consulate, and a few hours later the Berlin fire brigade was made to completely clean all the defaced windows (but later again, still on the same day, the goods displayed in all the defaced windows were ransacked!!) [1] Emigration Camp – Although the report’s subject is patently a deportation camp, the euphemism Abwanderung (emigration) has been retained. [2] Hauptsturmführer - Approx. equivalent: Captain [3] The term Schleuse denotes a lock used in transferring canal or coastal shipping between different water levels. In the present context, The term Schleuse might be best conveyed in English by some such term as pen or holding room. In terms of function, the nearest modern equivalent is a departure lounge. [4] Tetschen Bodenbach – Aussig Theresienstadt: Tetschen Bodenbach – Aussig Theresienstadt: were the wartime German names for places in postwar Czechoslovakia. [5] Gerichtsassessor - The title indicates a fairly recently qualified lawyer, perhaps equivalent to a junior barrister. [6] Scharführer – Approx. equiv.: Section leader. Hauptscharführer: Chief platoon leader. [7] Obersturmbannführer: Rank equivalent to a lieutenant-colonel in the German army [8] Zunächst gingen ... weiter! – The meaning of this sentence remains obscure to the translator. The translation has been kept as literal as possible, except for von Juden, which would normally mean of/by Jews. The text offers only thin circumstantial evidence (a degree of syntactical incoherence) for a conjectural substitution of released earlier for now released.

27,"[""Mrs Steinharter was the wife of a well-to-do Munich lawyer. With the economic elimination of the Jews, the Steinharter's moved to Garmisch-Partenkirchen and lived there unmolested until 1939. On 9 November the Steinharter's were taken to the town hall and, with a gun on the desk, had to sign an undertaking that the Steinharter's were leaving voluntarily the same day. Under SS guard the Steinharter's packed and settled all the formalities and left for Munich. the Steinharter's's flat was sealed. While living in a Munich hotel, Mrs Steinharter, accompanied by Mrs Steinharter's former landlady who was a member of the Party, went secretly to Their flat and packed some of Mrs Steinharter's belongings. In endless negotiations for papers and visas the Steinharter's's tried to emigrate, Switzerland refused a visa, the Steinharter's's quota number for USA was too high, but finally in August 1939 the Steinharter's could go to England, due to the generous help of an English Jew. the Steinharter's were given a house rent-free and lived on the Steinharter's's money in Switzerland. Mr Steinharter soon found office work, and after 5 years the Steinharter's were naturalized. Mr Steinharter died in 1948, and Mrs Steinharter took up nursing. During this difficult period Mrs Steinharter received much kindness and help from English people. Mrs Steinharter now lives at the Otto Schiff House. In Mrs Steinharter's restitution claim the former Gauleiter Hausböck proved a most helpful witness. Emigration Obstacles Ida Eva Steinharter, née Hechinger. Born: 12 October 1881 in Nuremberg. Religion: Jewish. Married: 1900, widowed in 1914. Married Mrs Steinharter's second husband, Dr Steinharter, a legal adviser and state prosecutor, in Munich in 1919. He died in London in 1948. They had no children. Parents: father was a merchant. Both parents came from Buchau near Ulm in Württemberg. When Mrs Steinharter was married, Mrs Steinharter lived in Munich, where Mrs Steinharter's husband took a very prestigious job. Both parents lived comfortably. When Mrs Steinharter's husband was stripped of her husband's position at the beginning of the Hitler regime and was no longer allowed to perform any legal duties, the Steinharter's decided to move away from Munich. the Steinharter's moved to Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 1934, as the Steinharter's thought the opportunity to do sports would be a distraction for a very depressed man. the Steinharter's initially lived in a furnished room. However, the Steinharter's soon got the chance to rent a little house that was still being built. The owners of a little house that was still being built lived in northern Germany (Wilhelmshaven) and did not want to move into a little house that was still being built just yet. The owners of the house – were extremely accommodating and drew up a very fair contract with the Steinharter's. the Steinharter's had the Steinharter's's furniture shipped from Munich and felt at home in a little house that was still being built. However after almost five years (1939), a “Jewish ban” was issued in Garmisch-Partenkirchen – Garmisch-Partenkirchen was to be “cleansed of the Jews” immediately. But all the Steinharter's's neighbours and the locals who knew the Steinharter's said: “Oh, they don’t mean the Steinharter's by that.” The people living in Garmisch-Partenkirchen were not really aware of what was going on in the outside world. At 9am on 9 November, local men came to take the Steinharter's to the town hall. A revolver was kept on the desk throughout the hearing that followed. The officer on duty apparently told the Steinharter's that the Steinharter's had to leave Garmisch-Partenkirchen by 6pm. “If the Steinharter's sign this to say that the Steinharter's will leave Garmisch-Partenkirchen - 2 - voluntarily with the Steinharter's's money and personal possessions by 6pm tonight, then the Führer has stipulated that you may leave England without your passport. (the Steinharter's's passports had already been confiscated). You can hand in your luggage when you book your tickets to a destination outside of England.” the Steinharter's were supervised by an SS officer when packing the Steinharter's's belongings and arranging the Steinharter's's most important personal matters, as well as when the Steinharter's were taken to the train station. Once vacated, the Steinharter's's homes were sealed by the SS officers. One of the Steinharter's's neighbours, a Christian doctor, issued a medical certificate to state that Mrs Steinharter was unwell. This enabled the Steinharter's to keep the Steinharter's's car and use their car to drive to the station. (Mrs Steinharter was, in fact, healthy!) But Mr Steinharter seized the opportunity and played along with the whole eviction. And so the Steinharter's drove to the station, handed in the Steinharter's's baggage to be sent to Switzerland after purchasing a ticket to Munich, but then got in their car and drove to Munich. One of Mrs Steinharter brothers, who had recently been living with them, went with the Steinharter's on Mrs Steinharter’s brothers, who had recently been living with them's dangerous journey home. It was dark and dense fog closed in, so Mrs Steinharter’s brothers, who had recently been living with them drove very slowly and only arrived late in the night of 10 November. This was Mrs Steinharter’s brothers, who had recently been living with them's saviour, as Mrs Steinharter’s brothers, who had recently been living with them were not caught and Mrs Steinharter’s brothers, who had recently been living with them also escaped the arrests of all Jews that were made the day before. It was difficult to find accommodation, but Mrs Steinharter’s brothers, who had recently been living with them ended up in the Regina Palast Hotel. Mrs Steinharter’s brothers, who had recently been living with them remained in Mrs Steinharter’s brothers, who had recently been living with them's room while in the Regina Palast Hotel and then drove to the Consulate General of Switzerland, where they found out that everything the Nazis told them was a scam, and you could not get into Switzerland without a passport. In actual fact, all the Jews from Garmisch-Partenkirchen who tried to cross the border were arrested upon arrival. Mrs Steinharter made one more clandestine trip back to Garmisch-Partenkirchen. - 3 - Even Mrs Steinharter's husband was unaware of Mrs Steinharter's plans. Mrs Steinharter was accompanied by the owner of the house in which they lived in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Mrs Steinharter came along to help the Steinharter's once Mrs Steinharter heard about the whole eviction. It is worth mentioning that Mrs Steinharter was a member of the Party and Mrs Steinharter's son was in the Gestapo in London. As the landlady of the house in which they lived in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Mrs Steinharter could not be refused entry to a little house that was still being built, and Mrs Steinharter was allowed in with Mrs Steinharter. They both packed everything they could take with them and ended up leaving a little house that was still being built with 11 suitcases, shipping everything as registered luggage to Munich. However, the furniture, large rugs and various valuables were left behind. the Steinharter's were in contact with a cousin in Munich, who made every effort to ensure the Steinharter's's lawful entry to Switzerland by issuing a guarantee for the Steinharter's. However, there were long delays at the Consulate General of Switzerland in Munich, and the Steinharter's's emigration to Switzerland was ultimately rejected. In the meantime, Mrs Steinharter had received Mrs Steinharter's exit permit due to Mrs Steinharter's social status, so the Steinharter's attempted to get to the U.S.A. the Steinharter's received three visas, but the Steinharter's's waiting numbers within the quota were not due to be called for at least another 4 years. Shortly afterwards, a new regulation came into force: men over the age of 60 and men over the age of 60's wives would be allowed a “transit stay” in England. But men over the age of 60 and their wives needed either a guarantee or to be in possession of a certain amount of money, otherwise the women would have to go as domestic staff. Although the Steinharter's had money in Switzerland, money was not enough for the period of time the Steinharter's were expecting to stay in England. Transferring money from Switzerland would have been possible. One of the Steinharter's's lawyer friends living in England – a Jew from Germany – wanted to help the Steinharter's and came up with an idea to get the Steinharter's what the Steinharter's wanted. One of their lawyer friends living in England – a Jew from Germany – simply turned to a Jewish diamond merchant, - 4 - who was known for being very wealthy but was not a personal acquaintance. One of their lawyer friends living in England – a Jew from Germany – told One of their lawyer friends living in England – a Jew from Germany – what had happened and asked for either money or a guarantee for One of their lawyer friends living in England – a Jew from Germany –'s persecuted Jewish friends. the Steinharter's received the guarantee from a Jewish diamond merchant, - 4 - who was known for being very wealthy but was not a personal acquaintance and were subsequently able to travel to England. However, Mrs Steinharter’s brother was not able to emigrate with the Steinharter's as Mrs Steinharter’s brother was not yet 60 years old. Mrs Steinharter’s brother ultimately managed to illegally cross the border to Luxembourg. the Steinharter's arrived in England on 27 August 1939. Getting out of Munich was very risky right up to the last minute: the British Consulate General in Munich was about to close as relations had broken down as a result of the impending war. the Steinharter's must have been so happy when the Steinharter's received the permit for England in time. the permit for England needed to be entered on the Steinharter's's Jewish identity card, otherwise the permit for England would not have been valid. No flights were departing at this time, but the Steinharter's managed to book the Steinharter's on to the last ship for England. So the Steinharter's travelled via Frankfurt to the Hook of Holland and crossed the sea on the Steinharter's's rescue journey. The overcrowded train was the unpleasant end to the gruelling, frightening and hounded chapter of the Steinharter's's lives in England. There were civil servants from the Consulate travelling with the Steinharter's to England on The overcrowded train. Mrs Steinharter said it was like being on an emigration ship. the Steinharter's settled in London, where the Steinharter's were initially able to live on the money that the Steinharter's wired from Switzerland. the Steinharter's took a room in a boarding house, but the Steinharter's were soon able to upgrade the Steinharter's's apartment through the Steinharter's's ties with an English Jew, a childhood friend of Mr Steinharter. an English Jew, a childhood friend of Mr Steinharter's husband was the Chairman of - 5 - Bloomsbury House and the owner of an unoccupied house in Munich. the Chairman of - 5 - Bloomsbury House and the owner of an unoccupied house in London gave the Steinharter's an unoccupied house in London fully furnished and rent-free. the Steinharter's were finally at peace after the multitude of experiences and the turmoil of the past few years that culminated in the Steinharter's's emigration. Mr Steinharter soon found work in a factory office, where Mr Steinharter was treated very kindly by the English boss, who was a Christian, and Mr Steinharter's work colleagues. Mr Steinharter died in 1948. The owner of the house that the Steinharter's had been living in had also died, and an unoccupied house in London was now being used for other purposes. an unoccupied house in London would have been too large for Mrs Steinharter as a widow anyway. So Mrs Steinharter moved out, initially living with a neighbour. Immediately after Mrs Steinharter's husband’s death, Mrs Steinharter received great support and kindness from Mrs Steinharter's neighbours, and Mrs Steinharter could not be more thankful, even today. All of the people who were so keen to help Mrs Steinharter were English. Shortly after this, Mrs Steinharter moved away to a boarding house in Belsize Park, where Mrs Steinharter lived for seven years. Five years of seven years, until Mrs Steinharter fell ill, Mrs Steinharter worked as a private nurse. Despite having never worked in that kind of role before, Mrs Steinharter made the most of Mrs Steinharter's new life. Mrs Steinharter was called on by various doctors, so Mrs Steinharter always had plenty to do. Mrs Steinharter now lives in Otto Schiff House, Munich. the Steinharter's had quickly decided against emigrating to USA given the Steinharter's's satisfactory circumstances in Munich and the Steinharter's's receipt of a residence permit. Five years in, the Steinharter's became British citizens. - 6 - The following may be of interest: When Mrs Steinharter claimed compensation, as part of the reparations process, for the possessions left behind in the house in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Mrs Steinharter's representative, a lawyer in Munich, contacted several witnesses. an English Jew, a childhood friend of Mr Steinharter was summoned as a key witness. an English Jew, a childhood friend of Mr Steinharter confirmed all of Mrs Steinharter claims, but then stated that the possessions left behind in the house in Garmisch-Partenkirchen had been publicly the auction. Until the auction, the possessions left behind in the house in Garmisch-Partenkirchen were guarded by SS officers to prevent looting. Based on this statement, which did not need to be reviewed further, Mrs Steinharter received confirmation of Mrs Steinharter's compensation claim.

28,"['Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth, married a German Jew in Baden-Baden. When the Nazis came to power, the couple emigrated to Holland where Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth tried to assist as many people as possible. Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth always acted on intuition, asking for the co-operation of people whom Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth had not met before, and was never mistaken in Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth's judgment. In this way Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth secured the help of Mr Stroes, secretary at the municipality of Oosterbeck who provided Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth with forged papers in order to ‘legalize’ 6 Jewish children. Forged papers were also procured for the Durlacher-family but Forged papers proved to be insufficient. In a very complicated way the couple was able to get into possession of the birth certificates in photostatic of a Dutch couple, Mr and Mrs Zeller, who had emigrated to the USA. years ago. As Mr and Mrs Zeller Mr and Mrs Zeller asked permission to settle down in Holland where Mrs Durlacher-Cohen tried to assist as many people as possible again, pretending that Mr and Mrs Zeller's passports were lost during a raid in France. The permit was granted and Mr and Mrs Zeller rented a house in Heelsum near Arnheim in autumn 1943; Mr and Mrs Zeller's two sons lived ‘underground’ with Mr and Mrs Zeller. Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth describes the many ways in which the Dutch people, private persons as well as officials, assisted the Jews. Our Illegal Life in Holland where Mrs Durlacher-Cohen tried to assist as many people as possible Mrs Henriette Durlacher-Cohen was born in Holland [illegible] and married a German Jew, with whom she lived in Baden-Baden, Germany. When the National Socialist laws made life too hard in Germany, they emigrated to Holland where Mrs Durlacher-Cohen tried to assist as many people as possible and tried to help as many people as they could throughout the war years. Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth took a 14-year-old cousin to a hiding spot, for example, as a 14-year-old cousin was living all by a 14-year-old cousin. Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth's parents had been deported. As long as a 14-year-old cousin – like any other child in hiding – did not have a personal identity card, Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth was forced to live in hiding, without being able to access normal education or participate in any of the activities children normally do. Personal identity cards were only issued once young people reached the age of 15. Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth therefore went to the local council secretariat of the town of Oosterbeek, using a false name and presenting Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth as being non-Jewish. Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth approached the office manager, a Mr Stroes, whom Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth asked to show Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth how to obtain a false personal identity card without having to steal one. the office manager, a Mr Stroes, whom she asked to show her how to obtain a false personal identity card without having to steal one gave sympathetic advice. Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth had not known the office manager, a Mr Stroes, whom she asked to show her how to obtain a false personal identity card without having to steal one. There were no rules which Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth could have used for guidance {[illegible]} as to which officials could be trusted and which not. That was something Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth therefore always decided based on Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth's gut feeling. Thinking back, Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth believes that sometimes the way people expressed people played a role and that sometimes - 2 - Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth could see that people would be able to trust each other just by looking into people’s eyes. the office manager, a Mr Stroes, whom she asked to show her how to obtain a false personal identity card without having to steal one informed Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth that a written application needed to be made to obtain an ID card, and that the personal details of both the child and the parents needed to be enclosed with a written application. Then an ID card would simply be issued. As a 14-year-old cousin lived in hiding and was Jewish, neither Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth's own papers nor those of Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth's parents could be used, and therefore personal details needed to be “found”. the office manager, a Mr Stroes, whom she asked to show her how to obtain a false personal identity card without having to steal one stole a blank marriage certificate from the civil registry, which they completed with two random names as the married couple. They retained the child's first name, but used the married name of the married couple as the surname, and predated the child's date of birth by one year so that the child would be entitled to have an ID card. They falsified a blank marriage certificate from the civil registry, which they completed with two random names as the married couple without any difficulty, and following this success Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth “legalised” five other children in collaboration with the office manager, a Mr Stroes, whom she asked to show her how to obtain a false personal identity card without having to steal one. This not only ensured that five other children were able to lead normal lives, but five other children could also legally obtain food cards and other ration coupons (for people living in hiding, food cards and other ration coupons could often only be obtained by stealing food cards and other ration coupons), and the risk of being found was reduced to a minimum for both five other children and the people posing as five other children's parents. The rescue of five other children was a total success. Many of those living in hiding tried to get rid of Many of those living in hiding's own ID cards, which were marked with a “J”, and to get normal ID cards instead. To achieve this, Christian Dutch officials proceeded as follows to steal papers from the various authorities issuing these cards. Christian Dutch officials took a few blank cards every day or every week, which were then completed with false names and stamps by the organisation of Illegals}. The officials who stole a few blank cards every day or every week, which were then completed with false names and stamps by the organisation of Illegals} took a great risk, - 3 - as did the people who completed a few blank cards every day or every week, which were then completed with false names and stamps by the organisation of Illegals} with names and stamps, but the risk was greatest for those who used a few blank cards every day or every week, which were then completed with false names and stamps by the organisation of Illegals}. In Baden-Baden, people needed to be registered not only with the residents’ registration office at people's place of residence, but also with the central people’s registry (Bevolkingsbüro) in The Hague. In very few cases it was possible to have stolen original cards registered with the central registry in The Hague. It was possible to carry out only so few of these manipulations because the central people’s registry (Bevolkingsbüro) in The Hague was under German supervision. If an ID card was not registered in The Hague, there was a risk of being found out in case of a thorough check. The checks were generally not that thorough on trains and in the streets, as long as people did not look Jewish. But when searches were conducted in people’s homes, officers checked very carefully and it was likely that people would be found out. From 1942 onwards, it was often the case that entire streets were blocked off and then all homes in entire streets were searched. Around 1943, the Durlacher-family lived with such falsified, but inadequate papers under the name of Dubois in the town of Benekom near Arnheim. the Durlacher-family urgently needed good papers, because the Durlacher-family's son had escaped from the Westerbork camp. the Durlacher-family thought that the Durlacher-family might be able to “this idea” {[illegible]}, coming back to Baden-Baden from abroad. However, putting this idea into practice required enormous preparatory work, and it took 5 months just to obtain the tickets for Mr and Mrs Durlacher. Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth again approached Mr Stroes, who still thought of Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth's - 4 - as being non-Jewish. Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth asked Mr Stroes, secretary at the municipality of Oosterbeck who provided her with forged papers in order to ‘legalize’ 6 Jewish children how Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth could obtain approval for a Dutch family wanting to migrate back to Holland where Mrs Durlacher-Cohen tried to assist as many people as possible from southern France in order to settle in Holland where Mrs Durlacher-Cohen tried to assist as many people as possible. Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth chose southern France because southern France was beyond the demarcation line and not occupied, and the Germans were therefore unable to make any enquiries there. Mr Stroes, secretary at the municipality of Oosterbeck who provided her with forged papers in order to ‘legalize’ 6 Jewish children told Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth that five other children should simply come; five other children would only need to show five other children's passports, to be approved for settlement in Holland where Mrs Durlacher-Cohen tried to assist as many people as possible by the central registry in The Hague. Knowing these facts, Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth went home, and the family – the sons were 17 and 19 years old – worked out the following plan, as the family – the sons were 17 and 19 years old – would be unable to immigrate again under the name of Durlacher. the family – the sons were 17 and 19 years old – tracked down a family where both the husband and wife had been born in Holland where Mrs Durlacher-Cohen tried to assist as many people as possible but had emigrated to the USA long before the war. both the husband and wife had last visited Holland where Mrs Durlacher-Cohen tried to assist as many people as possible in about 1935, when both the husband and wife lived in Wageningen near Arnheim. The plan hatched out by the family – the sons were 17 and 19 years old – was carried out by Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth because Mrs Durlacher-Cohen, a Dutch Jewess by birth was the one looking least Jewish. Durlacher called the residents’ registration office in Wageningen near Arnheim and asked for all of the personal details of the Zeller family from the USA, who had stayed in Wageningen near Arnheim for a three-month visit in 1935. Everybody was free to ask for this kind of information. Durlacher agreed that Durlacher would call again the following day, and Durlacher was provided with all of the personal details of the Zeller family from the USA, who had stayed in Wageningen for a three-month visit in 1935 in all available detail. Zeller had been born in Enkhuizen in northern Holland and Mrs Zeller in Rotterdam. Durlacher then wrote to the civil registries in Enkhuizen in northern Holland and Rotterdam, asking for copies of the birth certificates, purportedly on behalf of the Zeller family in the USA. After 5 days, Durlacher had photocopies of the birth certificates. Armed with photocopies of the birth certificates, - 5 - Durlacher then went to Zeist near Utrecht, presenting Durlacher as Durlacher, asking for permission to resettle in Holland where Mrs Durlacher-Cohen tried to assist as many people as possible. When Durlacher was asked to submit Durlacher's passport and that of Durlacher's husband, Durlacher explained that her passport and that of her husband had been lost during a bomb raid on Strasbourg and that Durlacher had been unable to rescue anything but her passport and that of her husband's birth certificates, of which Durlacher showed the photocopies. Durlacher's story was believed, and Durlacher was given the necessary forms, which Durlacher completed and which the local council in Zeist then forwarded to the central registry in The Hague. 48 hours later, the local council in Zeist was given approval for the Zeller family to settle in Zeist. the Durlacher-family were able to pick up the Durlacher-family's papers on the following day, and the office manager, a Mr Stroes, whom she asked to show her how to obtain a false personal identity card without having to steal one now had legal papers in the name of Zeller and Durlacher had papers in the name of Zeller-Selbach. the Durlacher-family stated that the Durlacher-family were living in a guest house in Zeist, but gave a false address. Now the Durlacher-family were able to obtain food cards and other ration coupons from the competent authorities. Nobody thought or suspected that the papers were falsified, as the Durlacher-family only used original papers. After a few weeks, the Durlacher-family found a furnished house in Hoelsum, also near Arnheim, which the Durlacher-family rented officially and then moved in on l October 1943. the Durlacher-family were able to have the Durlacher-family's two sons with the Durlacher-family, but only in secret. five other children needed to be legalised differently, as five other children would have otherwise have been recruited for labour service or defence services by the Germans. This is why the Durlacher-family did not want to become fully official and “legal”. - 6 - the Durlacher-family's son Leofried was the one who had managed to escape from Arnheim. All German authorities had been informed of the incident, and Their son Leofried would have been executed on the spot had Their son Leofried been found. Their son Leofried was studying textile chemistry at the time. All students were at a risk of being abducted to Germany, and to prevent that from happening, the Durlacher-family thought that Their son Leofried should write to various factories and dye works in southern Germany that the Durlacher-family were aware of, under the alias of Leonardo Maduro from Curacao, West Indies. Their son Leofried asked the companies whether the companies were looking for a good worker, and Their son Leofried received responses from almost all of the companies. Some asked Their son Leofried for further details and information, as they would like to hire Their son Leofried, while others wrote back saying others were interested and would be in touch soon. These letters were very important, as during raids it was important to be able to show that one was looking for work in Germany. Also, one needed to be very persuasive with the SS to convince the SS that it would be better for the German economy to keep businesses running rather than have young men sent off to do forestry or similar labour. Of course Their son Leofried never had any intention of taking a position in Germany; it was enough to be able to show that Their son Leofried wished to work in Germany. Durlacher cannot remember what Mr and Mrs Durlacher did to save Mr and Mrs Durlacher's other son, Evan. Durlacher believes that Mr and Mrs Durlacher used a similar approach with Dutch companies. - 7 - In about summer 1944, all 1000 guilder notes were cancelled, and people could exchange all 1000 guilder notes for different bank notes of the same value. But there was a set date (which Durlacher cannot remember), after which the exchange rate for 1000 guilder notes varied between 400 and 600 guilders and an official exchange was no longer possible. People forced to live in secrecy and hiding had little opportunity to exchange People forced to live in secrecy and hiding's money in time, and People forced to live in secrecy and hiding suffered huge losses. Durlacher had become friends with an older lady, who was a member of the council of Gelderland province (an older lady, who was a member of the council of Gelderland province (she cannot recall her name cannot recall an older lady, who was a member of the council of Gelderland province (she cannot recall her name's name.) an older lady, who was a member of the council of Gelderland province introduced Durlacher to some Christians who were sufficiently wealthy and prepared to exchange 1000 guilders for l000 guilder notes even after the deadline had expired. With these transactions, people living in hiding probably entered a moral obligation to pay back the money if people living in hiding survived the war. However, it was assumed even then that people living in hiding would people living in hiding get the money back from Germany, provided people living in hiding were able to demonstrate that it had been impossible to exchange the notes in time. Through Durlacher's contacts, Durlacher managed to this way a number of people living in hiding in this way. To do this way, Durlacher had to these trips by train to Strasbourg, Strasbourg, Arnheim and other destinations, sometimes several times a week, sometimes every day.

29,"['A report on the difficulties the author had to overcome. 1,000 passengers on the St. Louis steamer who had received the permit of immigration to Cuba were not allowed to land, when 1,000 passengers on the St. Louis steamer who had received the permit of immigration to Cuba arrived at Havana. The American Joint offered to pay 1/2 million $ for 1,000 passengers on the St. Louis steamer who had received the permit of immigration to Cuba, which was refused; 1,000 passengers on the St. Louis steamer who had received the permit of immigration to Cuba's representative in Paris succeeded to get the offer accepted in four equal quarters through Belgium, England, France and Holland. 9.

Frustrated Emigration to Cuba Throughout all of 1937 we were preoccupied with the question of our emigration, and when the horrible wave of arrests of Jews began at the end of 1938, the question of our emigration became even more urgent for us, even though we were spared the horrible wave of arrests of Jews because of our particular circumstances. Thus, the years 1937 and 1938 were a time of great difficulties for us, of agitation, and sometimes of despair, until we finally saw a silver lining on the horizon. We finally remembered that we had first cousins in New York with whom we had corresponded until the outbreak of World War 1. But, as often happens in such cases, the correspondence wasn’t revived, the old letters had gotten lost, and the contact was completely broken off. How could one find the address after a space of time of more than 20 years. I contacted every possible Jewish organization in New York. It took about 9 months until it was determined that “It was all in vain!” By chance, but with a good feeling, I turned for advice to Herbert Lehmann at the time and described our situation to Herbert Lehmann. I received a very kind response immediately. Herbert Lehmann told me that Herbert Lehmann had asked the New York Chief of Police to do everything Herbert Lehmann could to find our relatives. Caught in the continental view that it must be a minor matter for a Chief of Police to find residents in a Chief of Police's city, and unaware of the fact that over there , there is no requirement to register with the local police, there was great joy in our halls in response to this letter from Herbert Lehmann. But this feeling of “being on top of the world” was soon followed by “the depths of despair” when the New York Chief of Police informed us much later that the New York Chief of Police's attempts had been in vain and would remain so unless I was in a position to specify the last address I knew of my relatives. But this wasn’t possible for us. In our despair, I wrote again to Herbert Lehmann, who answered me immediately, that Herbert Lehmann had assigned the investigation to a special office. And lo and behold! Less than 14 days later, I received word from a special office of our relatives's success. On the basis of the documents provided, the oldest member of the American family had come forward and acknowledged our relatives's relationship. A few weeks later, our son received an affidavit for the U.S.A., on the basis of which our son was then later accepted into the Kitchener Camp in England since in the meantime the German quota for immigrating to the U.S.A. had been closed. Precisely on New Year’s Day 1938, the “liberating” telegram arrived for my wife and me informing my wife and me that my wife and me's relatives had made available to my wife and me a large amount of dollars at the HICEM in Paris, the representative of the Jewish Aid Society in Berlin, which, after consultation with the Jewish Aid Society in Berlin, my wife and me were supposed to use for emigration. At this time the opportunity arose to get a permit for Cuba for a sum of money of several hundred dollars. my wife and me took advantage of the opportunity and received from the agent, who handled these matters, the news that my wife and me's permit was approved and that my wife and me should take care of the immediate transfer of a sum of money of several hundred dollars from Paris. my wife and me immediately did what was necessary at the Jewish Aid Society in Berlin and waited with excitement for a permit for Cuba until one day, to my wife and me's great horror, my wife and me received a telegram from Cuba that the immediate transfer of the sum of money from Paris had not arrived and that my wife and me's acceptance by Cuba could only be valid for another 48 hours. The transfer from Paris had apparently been forgotten; whether the immediate transfer of the sum of money from Paris was due to the fault of HICEM or the Jewish Aid Society in Berlin remains an open question. Through an exchange of telegrams and a telephone call with Paris, I finally still managed to get the transfer to Cuba done in time, and my wife and me promptly received the permit. Booking the berths also didn’t proceed without difficulties. Hapag (Hamburg America Line) had commissioned a special ship, the largest diesel motor ship, the “St. Louis,” for 1000 passengers who all had the same permit to Cuba. When I arrived at the Berlin office of Hapag (Hamburg America Line) in order to reserve two berths, the official told me that everything was sold out. Thereupon I asked the official if it might not be possible to get berths if I paid the fee in American currency which I had available in Paris. the official promised me that the official would immediately contact the headquarters in Paris and would let me know the next day. - 3 - But I learned the next day that the Jewish Aid Society in Berlin had reserved berths on a special ship, the largest diesel motor ship, the “St. Louis,” which could not all be fully used by a special ship, the largest diesel motor ship, the “St. Louis,”, and the Jewish Aid Society in Berlin gave me permission to demand two of reserved berths on this ship which could not all be fully used by it for myself. When I arrived again at the Hapag (Hamburg America Line) office on the next day and the official, beaming, said that I could get two more berths in exchange for payment in currency, I explained to the official that I could no longer honor my offer on this matter because the official had given me false information, and I demanded two of the berths that had been reserved by the Jewish Aid Society in Berlin, to which the official had to express the official's agreement under these circumstances, whether the official liked it or not. So my wife and me left from Paris on May 13, 1939 on a special ship, the largest diesel motor ship, the “St. Louis,” to Cuba, though my wife and me could only take with my wife and me two suitcases with things for four weeks, because the Jewish Aid Society in Berlin supposedly hadn’t been able to complete the Jewish Aid Society in Berlin's examination of my wife and me's baggage lists in time. A shipping agent my wife and me had contracted was supposed to forward all of my wife and me's luggage to Cuba after examining my wife and me's lists of the contents. After a wonderful trip in very beautiful weather across the Atlantic, my wife and me arrived in Havana in good spirits. When all the passengers had already made preparations to disembark, the catastrophic message came that the President of Havana had this prohibition my wife and me's landing at the last moment, and Cuban police came on board to watch over my wife and me. my wife and me were never told the reasons for this prohibition. the Jewish Aid Society in Berlin immediately took on the matter, prominent public figures flew over from New York, but all attempts were in vain, and even the Jewish Aid Society in Berlin offer to pay half a million dollars for permission for this case was rejected. Thus, a special ship, the largest diesel motor ship, the “St. Louis,” had to leave Havana for Berlin with all the Jewish emigrants after the captain received from Berlin per telegram the instructions “Head back to Berlin.” The mood on board was one of desperation. Through the Jewish Aid Society in Berlin mediation, world opinion now stepped into action, and when this became known, the initial shock subsided. News arrived daily about the efforts to save my wife and me, and depending on how the news sounded, The mood on board would naturally change. The optimist saw one night between two days, the pessimist saw one day between two nights. By and large, however, the mood remained calm and composed and there wasn’t any panic, in large part due to the conduct of Captain Schröder, a true - 4 - human being whom all the passengers couldn’t thank enough. Finally Mr. Tropper, the representative of the American Joint in Paris, succeeded in getting Belgium, England, France and Holland, to each take in one-quarter of the passengers in exchange for the amount of money that the President of Havana had offered. my wife and me ended up on the English list and landed in June 1939 in Southampton; my wife and me were saved. There was another epilogue for my wife and me. Because it had become known throughout all of Germany through the press and radio that my wife and me had been forbidden to land, all of the shipping agents who were supposed to forward my wife and me's luggage had failed to forward our luggage and were waiting for further news from all of the shipping agents who were supposed to forward our luggage's clients. Only my wife and me's shipping agent didn’t wait; Only our shipping agent forwarded all of my wife and me's luggage to Cuba although Only our shipping agent, as my wife and me later determined, knew full well about this prohibition. So my wife and me arrived here in light summer clothes, in part even wearing tropical clothes, without any stuff for winter. Because my wife and me weren’t successful at getting my wife and me's luggage returned to Berlin within two months of my wife and me's arrival in Berlin, and the war broke out in the meantime, my wife and me had to fight for more than a year until my wife and me got my wife and me's luggage back, and this happened only after my wife and me's relatives in New York agreed to pay 165 dollars for storage fees in Cuba. The amount of approximately 400 dollars, that had been transferred from Paris to Cuba for the permit, remained lost.

30,"[""A report by a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's paralysed husband until her paralysed husband's death in September 1942. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 describes the deportation of a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's Jewish friends and a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's relatives. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's family was deported from Breslau: a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's sister in November 1941, and a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's parents some months later to the camp Riebnig near Brieg. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 records numerous cases of kindness shown to a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 and help given to a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 and other Jews at considerable risk by non-Jewish friends and even strangers. non-Jewish friends and even strangers visited her and other Jews, gave her and other Jews food and ration cards, provided illegal billets and warned her and other Jews of impending arrests. Among those a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 mentioned as particularly helpful are: Heinz Hilpert, director of the Deutsche Theater, Karchow; the actor and film director, Fritz Clemens, a businessman and the actor and film director, Fritz Clemens, a businessman and his employee Kleinjung (who was jailed for having given ration cards to Jews)'s employee Kleinjung (who was jailed for having given ration cards to Jews); the literary historian Paul Wiegler; the editor of the Berliner Illustrierte Dr. Wuesten; Gotthard Schuh of the Meue Zuercher Zeitung; Harold Lechenperg, also of the Berliner Illustrierte; the cartoonist Theo Matejko (?) then with the periodical Die Wehrmacht. 9. Remarks : See related report P.III.d. No.536 also written by a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942. Non-Jews Helping Jews Our emigration failed because a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's late first husband Wilhelm Meyer suffered a stroke because of the anxiety, with complete paralysation of the left-hand side. We had to stay in Berlin, only our son came to England before the start of the war, aged 13 years old. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's husband died in autumn 1942, and a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 went into hiding in order to live illegally until the end of the war. Most depressing was not this illegal living, but rather the time beforehand in which the Nazi government measures became more and more grotesque and wicked. One after the other, our relatives and acquaintances disappeared one way or another and a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 was unable to keep any of this hidden from a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's husband. Rather, being completely fit mentally until my late first husband Wilhelm Meyer's death, my late first husband Wilhelm Meyer was needed by Jewish friends as an advisor, by the “Aryans” as a confidant for the “Aryans's outbursts of disapproval and desperation, and witnessed it all from my late first husband Wilhelm Meyer's bed possibly even more intensively. We received an evacuation summons twice, and both times we were delayed after a medical examination because my late first husband Wilhelm Meyer was unfit for travel. But from my late first husband Wilhelm Meyer's bed my late first husband Wilhelm Meyer said goodbye, first to many who, robbed of everything “completely legally”, could still travel out to England after the start of the war, and then those who had to go on the transport. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 helped one elderly lady whose children were in France, Mrs Danziger, with one elderly lady whose children were in France, Mrs Danziger, with her packing's packing. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 then heard that one elderly lady whose children were in France, Mrs Danziger, with her packing was struck by a blow at a Berlin railway station during the “loading” for Poland. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's husband had to hear everything from one collection, as an elderly woman two doors away from us (in a home with five tenants in which we had been temporarily housed) was taken away by police early at 5 o' clock. One of our acquaintances, a bachelor, Rudolf Kahn, was recognised without One of our acquaintances, a bachelor, Rudolf Kahn's star from someone in a cinema and denounced – this diversion was allowed as settlement for One of our acquaintances, a bachelor, Rudolf Kahn's forced labour from time to time – One of our acquaintances, a bachelor, Rudolf Kahn immediately hung One of our acquaintances, a bachelor, Rudolf Kahn in the police cell, even before the Gestapo arrived. One acquaintance, Bruno Goldberg (One acquaintance, Bruno Goldberg (his brother is in the USA and previously was an editor at Felix Bloch Erben's brother is in the USA and previously was an editor at Felix Bloch Erben) said goodbye to us. One acquaintance, Bruno Goldberg (his brother is in the USA and previously was an editor at Felix Bloch Erben) was in forced labour and learned in autumn 1942 that One acquaintance, Bruno Goldberg (his brother is in the USA and previously was an editor at Felix Bloch Erben) was threatened with collection. One acquaintance, Bruno Goldberg (his brother is in the USA and previously was an editor at Felix Bloch Erben) no longer went to One acquaintance, Bruno Goldberg (his brother is in the USA and previously was an editor at Felix Bloch Erben)'s work and wanted to cross the Grüne Grenze into Switzerland. One acquaintance, Bruno Goldberg (his brother is in the USA and previously was an editor at Felix Bloch Erben)'s reception by Swiss friends and also the route there where possible was prepared with the help of a good “Aryan” friend in Berlin. But One acquaintance, Bruno Goldberg (his brother is in the USA and previously was an editor at Felix Bloch Erben) seems to never have reached One acquaintance, Bruno Goldberg (his brother is in the USA and previously was an editor at Felix Bloch Erben)'s destination. Miss Berend, a sister of the Jean-Paul researcher Dr. Eduard Berend, who at the time had gone to Genf, was collected here and already at the collecting point on Levetzowstrasse. Miss Berend, a sister of the Jean-Paul researcher Dr. Eduard Berend, who at the time had gone to Genf's employer – the boss of a small private enterprise, who had received Miss Berend, a sister of the Jean-Paul researcher Dr. Eduard Berend, who at the time had gone to Genf as an allocated forced labourer – was still able to reclaim Miss Berend, a sister of the Jean-Paul researcher Dr. Eduard Berend, who at the time had gone to Genf from here and - 2 - get Miss Berend, a sister of the Jean-Paul researcher Dr. Eduard Berend, who at the time had gone to Genf out again. The only time a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 heard of someone being able to get back out of there. But unfortunately a few months later Miss Berend, a sister of the Jean-Paul researcher Dr. Eduard Berend, who at the time had gone to Genf was “collected” for good. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 personally was released from forced labour due to a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's husband’s need for care; however a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens, visited us every week, and from my school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens we learned how, there and in the Jewish community, everything was heading step by step towards complete liquidation and extermination. my school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens still had a long time, a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 think, until the introduction of the Jewish star; my school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens worked illegally as a secretary for authors and screenwriters. authors and screenwriters were put into contact with my school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens partly by the long-time secretary of the German Theatre where, under Hilpert as director, there was a particularly good and civil atmosphere. E.g. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 remember that my school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens – a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 believe still around 1940 – wrote a manuscript for the actor and director Karchow in my school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens's home in Westend. The forced labourers thought The forced labourers were protected through The forced labourers's work. But my school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens got a warning, on the back of which my school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens – a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 think on the 26th February 1943 – did not go to work, and in fact on the 26th February 1943 the workers were “collected” directly from the department at Siemens. my school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens went into hiding and after a time of vagabondage a friend of ours, a particularly good, civil person, who also supported a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 during a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's illegal time, Fritz Clemens, provided my school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens with a hiding place at the residence of one of a friend of ours, a particularly good, civil person, who also supported me during my illegal time, Fritz Clemens's customers. And a friend of ours, a particularly good, civil person, who also supported me during my illegal time, Fritz Clemens was in fact a Spanish diplomat who had brought a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty's German wife and children to Switzerland and was very glad that a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty's home in Halensee did not remain empty. a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty visited a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty's family in Switzerland and there tried to obtain false papers so that my school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens could go to a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty's wife. In doing so, without realising, a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty got mixed up with the Gestapo agents and so to a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty's horror a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty was the cause of my school friend Alice Schnell, who worked in the Jewish department at Siemens's arrest from a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty's home. a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty has a shop on Olivaer Platz and a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty's vendor at the time, Mr Kleinjung, for a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty's part created aid initiatives for Jews of a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty's own accord. A school friend of a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942, Hilde Bielschowski, went into hiding in the summer of ’42 together with A school friend of mine, Hilde Bielschowski,'s brother and mother (very difficult for three people together at the start), and a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty made ration cards for The three Bielschowskis. The three Bielschowskis got “snatched”, as we matter-of-factly and unpleasantly called it back then, and during interrogation The three Bielschowskis were blackmailed into giving the name of the supplier of ration cards. a Spanish diplomat who had brought his German wife and children to Spain and was very glad that his home in Halensee did not remain empty was arrested and put into jail, so survived the war, which otherwise, in England, would have been very doubtful. The conduct of our “Aryan” friends was for us the positive aspect of that time, with only two exceptions which a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 want to forget (today they are both head editors incidentally). Colleagues who were not so close - 3 - also expressed their sympathy. The literary historian Paul Wiegler, with whom we had never kept company, wrote to us in 1938 asking us to visit The literary historian Paul Wiegler, with whom we had never kept company. Dr. Wüsten, head of the Berliner Illustrierten until the war's end, but a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 believe not a PG, told us about Dr. Wüsten, head of the Berliner Illustrierten until the war’s end, but I believe not a PG,'s family and then apologised in a manner of speaking for the fact that Dr. Wüsten, head of the Berliner Illustrierten until the war’s end, but I believe not a PG, is the only one of Dr. Wüsten, head of the Berliner Illustrierten until the war’s end, but I believe not a PG,'s siblings who is not in jail, has not emigrated or is not politically disreputable in some other way. The Zurich photographer Gotthard Schuh – today editor of the Neuen Züricher Zeitung – visited us after the start of the war. When The Zurich photographer Gotthard Schuh – today editor of the Neuen Züricher Zeitung – went to Ullsteinhaus, an editor there asked The Zurich photographer Gotthard Schuh – today editor of the Neuen Züricher Zeitung –: “The Zurich photographer Gotthard Schuh – today editor of the Neuen Züricher Zeitung – aren’t living with these Meyers or going there are The Zurich photographer Gotthard Schuh – today editor of the Neuen Züricher Zeitung –? The Zurich photographer Gotthard Schuh – today editor of the Neuen Züricher Zeitung – can’t keep an honest relationship with Jews; Jews’re just as much enemies of the state as Poles.” The Zurich photographer Gotthard Schuh – today editor of the Neuen Züricher Zeitung – angrily told this to the head editor of the Berliner Illustrierten at the time, Harald Lechenpegg who, having never visited us before, asked to also be brought to us as a demonstration, and The Zurich photographer Gotthard Schuh – today editor of the Neuen Züricher Zeitung – sat for two hours at a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's husband’s bedside. The very well-known newspaper cartoonist Theo Matejko, who had been employed at the publishers Die Wehrmacht (a conservative, but not very Hitler-friendly publishers) since 1938, also regularly visited us during the war, brought us many expensive and for us unobtainable groceries and told us a lot of confidential news from the army, from the base and the front, and also from the Reich Chancellery. Before a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 went into hiding, a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 visited her paralysed husband and her paralysed husband's wife in order to say goodbye. There a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 learned the following: An animal painter An animal painter he had previously known had previously known had lost An animal painter he had previously known's work permit because An animal painter he had previously known was non-Aryan. First of all, An animal painter he had previously known had tried to sell An animal painter he had previously known's pictures for An animal painter he had previously known. Then, because An animal painter he had previously known no longer felt safe from persecution, An animal painter he had previously known let An animal painter he had previously known use An animal painter he had previously known's studio so that An animal painter he had previously known could work there in peace. Finally, because An animal painter he had previously known no longer felt safe in An animal painter he had previously known's own home, An animal painter he had previously known provided An animal painter he had previously known with a room in An animal painter he had previously known's house. But finally it was no longer possible for her paralysed husband to hide and avoid “collection”, and her paralysed husband procured her paralysed husband veronal. When a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 arrived at his own home, her paralysed husband had been on her paralysed husband's deathbed for a day, in other words unconscious. Because her paralysed husband was an especially strong, healthy person, her paralysed husband did not die quickly, and everybody was now fearing that perhaps the Gestapo could come before her paralysed husband was released. Because being called back to life and then evacuated was what you were especially scared of. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's husband also had to hear by letter about the evacuation of a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's relatives in Breslau in great detail. People in Breslau – unlike in the initially rigorously bureaucratic system in Berlin – were mainly evacuated as soon as a Nazi needed People in Breslau – unlike in the initially rigorously bureaucratic system in Berlin –'s apartment or house. These transports then initially went to three - 4 - camps in Schlesien Schlesien itself (a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 also remember Grüssau and Riebnig near Brieg), where Jews could even have a camp organisation, and where we could send letters and packages. As was soon exposed, they were only meant as transition camps for the full evacuation. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's sister, who lived with a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's parents, was very suddenly collected without prior notice. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's parents were not allowed to bring My sister, who lived with my parents's food and warm clothes at the collection point. My sister, who lived with my parents probably went to the Baltic; we have not heard anything more from My sister, who lived with my parents. That was in November 1941, and the elderly people now lived without My sister, who lived with my parents for five or six more months in the elderly people's home. the elderly people were given a few days notice of the evacuation of the elderly people's home. the evacuation of their home took place in the usual thuggish way. the elderly people had to take good clothes back off, which those collecting good clothes immediately packed for themselves, and the elderly people instead had to put on old things etc. etc. Good friends of a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's sister, Dr. Laubhardt, a teacher at the Victoriaschule, and his wife, who a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 am still friends with today, were with them until the end. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's parents went to the Riebnig camp. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's father died there from pneumonia after two months. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's sister’s friends had the courage to write long and wonderful letters of condolence to a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's mother there. The coffin was driven out of the Riebnig camp on a horse wagon and is supposed to have been buried at the Jewish cemetery in Brieg. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's mother was not allowed out of the Riebnig camp. You soon began to tell from the letters coming from these camps that once again packing, rearranging and gloomy leave-taking was beginning. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 do not know how long the Riebnig camp continued to exist. After a few months, a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's mother was taken away, a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 hope, to Theresienstadt. That was the last news we got from my mother there. After hearing these pieces of news my husband, who up until now had very bravely battled his heavy grievances, aware that it meant protection for a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942, lost the will to live. In September 1942, he died and a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's illegal time began. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's experiences after a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 went into hiding were more serious and were mostly more dramatic than how it sounds in the following accounts, and the danger which all those who helped a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 placed themselves into was very great. That a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's current husband came through it so unhurt is still a wonder today. Aside from a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's life, a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 certainly did not have much to risk. When a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 went into hiding, a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's son had been rescued in England, a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's husband was dead and a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's relatives were already collected and missing. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942's only concern - 5 - was to always handle a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 in such a way that a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 put those who were helping a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 in as little danger as possible. For a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942, the time before going into hiding was the truly grim part, when We Jews lived in the ghetto so-to-speak in Berlin, and learned of the full extent of the evil and corruption portrayed through the reports from various circles of acquaintances, and the dramas which took place as the Berlin Jews were taken away, both very completely, as most Germans did not learn until after the war. There were We Jews's friends, who partly belonged to the opposition or passive resistance. We Jews were the only ones who our friends, who partly belonged to the opposition or passive resistance could pour our friends, who partly belonged to the opposition or passive resistance's hearts out to without fear. There were also the Jewish friends who witnessed the operations in the Jewish community and in the places of forced labour, and then those who We Jews witnessed saying those who we witnessed saying their goodbyes before evacuation's goodbyes before evacuation. a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942 am one of those children of fortune who came through, and who came through very leniently at that. There were definitely people who – mostly because people who – mostly because they had lots of money – came through implausibly pleasantly and safely had lots of money – came through implausibly pleasantly and safely, but on the other hand some had to pass from hiding place to hiding place and deception to deception with far more difficulty and uncertainty than a Jewish woman who lived in Berlin with her paralysed husband until his death in September 1942.

31,"['In the winter of 1940 the author - a Polish Christian - fled with the author - a Polish Christian -'s husband from the Russians to Wilno. Mr Zadarnowska who had been a forester on an estate near Lida (East Poland) became a labourer, while the author - a Polish Christian - worked as stage designer at a theatre. Here the author - a Polish Christian - met a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska. After the German occupation of Wilno the Zadarnowska’s decided to return to the Zadarnowska’s's home, and Mrs Zadarnowska went to say farewell to a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska. Mrs Zadarnowska found the whole family in a state of upheaval, as the Germans had ordered all Jews to move into the ghetto. Nobody at the time knew of the subsequent mass murders in Ponary forest, but on Mrs Zadarnowska's return home, the author - a Polish Christian - felt compelled to save a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's daughter Lilka. In November 1941 the author - a Polish Christian - returned to Wilno. Ill though the author - a Polish Christian - was, the author - a Polish Christian - faced the inclement weather and considerable danger to establish contact with a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska. Finally, the author - a Polish Christian - found a workman willing to take a message into the ghetto, and Masza and her daughter Lilka met at the house of a mutual friend. Meanwhile the author - a Polish Christian - sold a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's valuables in order to finance the purchase of forged papers, a certificate of baptism and travel permits. At one of the “selections” a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's family had been included for the transport to Lida (East Poland), and in a desperate effort to save a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's friend, the author - a Polish Christian - prevailed upon Professor Kola Taranowski to give a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's shelter, so that a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's child did not have to return to the ghetto. The next day a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska escaped to Wilno. Encouraged by this success, the author - a Polish Christian - applied for the author - a Polish Christian -'s own travel paper, and at the psychological moment asked for the inclusion of “a child” and followed a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska to Wilno. After days of frantic search and with the help of a parson, the author - a Polish Christian - located a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and, in spite of the great dangers involved, travelled with a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her child to a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's home. a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's husband soon agreed to keep she and her child. Dangerous, nerve-racking months followed during which the author - a Polish Christian - tried to ward off the constant danger of detection by making a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska look more “Aryan”, and by teaching her child the Polish language and Christian prayers. In the following summer, frequent Russian partisans ambushes added to frequent Russian partisans's anguish and finally forced the Zadarnowska’s to move to Wilno. the Zadarnowska’s took a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her daughter Lilka with the Zadarnowska’s, but a few weeks later somebody asked for a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska on the telephone by a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's proper name. Undeterred by the danger and the proximity of Gestapo headquarters, the author - a Polish Christian - helped a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her child to flee to a farm, the commandant of the Polish Resistance having provided forged papers. A period of constant moves followed, and in the end, the author - a Polish Christian - had to take she and her child back, as nobody else was brave enough to shelter she and her child. Later, a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska decided to volunteer for work in Germany (Konstanz). the Zadarnowska’s were forced by the constant Russian air attacks to move to Warsaw, where she and her child got separated during the insurrection. Mrs Zadarnowska was taken to Breslau as a slave labourer; her husband was sent to Dachau where her husband perished. Mrs Zadarnowska managed to flee to Wilno and join a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska. she and her child had to work hard, and when, at the end of the war, Switzerland opened Mrs Zadarnowska's frontiers, Switzerland went there. Mrs Zadarnowska now works as a designer at the Polish museum in Rapperswi, - the Jewish family Mrs Zadarnowska saved live in Israel. Rescue of a Jewish family by a Polish Non-Jewess I met a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska in Wilno back in the winter of 1940. In September, my husband and I had to flee my husband and I's home near Lida (in the east of Poland) and leave behind all my husband and I's belongings. My husband had been working as a forester there. In all the awful chaos caused by the immense floods of refugees on all sides, my husband and I finally ended up in Wilno. In the east of Poland, by contrast, the mass deportation of the Polish population continued in earnest. (My mother and brother were among those deported and my mother sadly died somewhere in the depths of Russia[1] – most likely from hunger.) My husband got a job as a railway worker not far from Kaunas, whilst I found an opening for a stage designer at a travelling theatre, which attracted mostly amateurs who had previously practised intellectual careers. (The Russian NKVD [People\'s Commissariat for Internal Affairs] had an extremely poor opinion of intellectuals, so intellectuals had to assume a cover activity.) It was in a travelling theatre, which attracted mostly amateurs who had previously practised intellectual careers that a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska was working as a prompter (a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's husband Lazarz was a trader and together they had her daughter Lilka). a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska was a good colleague – I went to see a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska at a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's house once, but our friendship hadn\'t developed any further than that. Just before the outbreak of the war between Switzerland and Russia, the Germans started with the Germans's abominable deportations of the Polish population from Wilno too. their abominable deportations of the Polish population from Wilno too was followed by the German occupation. My husband made the decision at this point to return to our home to resume her husband's work as a forester. The plan was that I wouldn\'t be far behind, travelling in a truck from Wilno, as you needed to have a special permit to be able to travel by train. In the next few days, I was on my way to see the seamstress when I passed a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's apartment. I thought I would just pop in quickly to say goodbye. I found the whole family busy packing, as an order had been issued for all Jews to move into the ghetto. There was a lot of commotion but not a hint of panic since at this stage nobody knew that all of the Jews who were moved to the ghetto would be condemned to extermination. (Even later on the Jews in the ghetto couldn\'t believe that this was the case, but it was common knowledge in Wilno that the Jews being transported en masse away from the ghetto in trucks were being taken to Ponary, a wooded area of Lida (East Poland), where the Jews would be shot dead.) As we said our goodbyes, a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's husband jokingly said to me: \'We want to get some forged Gestapo papers for a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her daughter Lilka. If we did manage to do that, you could then take Masza and her daughter Lilka home with you.\' I laughed along to be polite and went on my way. I finally arrived home sick and tired, having travelled there from Wilno on a truck that belonged to the mayor, who was an acquaintance of ours. - 2 - Our lovely little home that we had lovingly set up as our own just before the war had been completely ransacked. We had to borrow flour for bread and other food from the farmers we knew. I stayed in bed for weeks on end and couldn\'t stop thinking about a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska. I slowly reached the decision that I had to rescue a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her daughter Lilka from the ghetto. I don\'t know why but I simply couldn\'t shake the idea that Masza and her daughter Lilka were worth risking our lives for. When I first mentioned it to my husband, her husband thought it was nothing more than a pipe dream and her husband didn\'t take me seriously at all. As I was still ill, I travelled to Wilno in November to see a doctor. While I was there, I was also going to collect someone we knew to come and help us around Wilno – we had promised someone we knew to come and help us around the house this beforehand. a doctor prescribed me more bed rest, but instead I spent days walking around Wilno trying to find a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska despite the cold and wet weather conditions. I heard that a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska was working in the kitchen at the Gestapo building. So then I spent a few days watching the groups of Jews that left the ghetto every day to go to work, but a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska was not among the groups of Jews that left the ghetto every day to go to work. In the end, I decided to simply go to the Gestapo building even though just walking past it was enough to give me goose bumps. I stopped a young Jewish girl working there and asked after a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska. a young Jewish girl thought I was mad and, with fear in a young Jewish girl's eyes, quickly whispered that I should leave right away. But I carried on looking for a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska. I paid a visit to a student I knew who now worked in a factory. When I was there, I saw a Jew who went to a factory every day to work. I finally had a way to reach a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska! a Jew who went to this same factory every day to work agreed to take my letter to a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska in the ghetto. a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and I were able to meet up several times at the home of some German railway workers who were staying in a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's friend\'s apartment and who were often able to pull a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska out of the ghetto under the pretext that some German railway workers who were staying in Masza\'s friend\'s apartment and who were often able to pull her out of the ghetto needed a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska to help some German railway workers who were staying in Masza\'s friend\'s apartment and who were often able to pull her out of the ghetto out around Masza\'s friend\'s apartment. I was feverish – all I could think about was how I would now be able to pull off my plan. I had to this sort of thing the Gestapo papers, baptism certificates and travel permits all myself. I didn\'t have any experience of this sort of thing at all and I certainly didn\'t have the money for this sort of thing. My main strategy was to sell some of a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's jewellery – on the black market, of course. I then spent days talking to all sorts of people to make all the necessary arrangements. During days, I came across some real idealists as well as some genuine scoundrels, but it was mostly just young \'adventurers\'. Obviously, these people had risked these people's lives and sometimes these people also had to \'pay off\' The Russian NKVD [People\'s Commissariat for Internal Affairs]. A group of these young men that I was meeting up with on an almost daily basis one day suddenly stopped showing up. It turned out that these people had actually been murdered by The Russian NKVD [People\'s Commissariat for Internal Affairs]... Eventually, I had my hands on the forged baptism certificates. However, when collecting the travel permits that I had been promised and had already paid for, I was told that a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska would have to go to the police in person for the collection. This was absolutely out of the question, as a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska clearly looked Jewish. Even Jews that had a very \'Aryan\' appearance would generally not dare do this (and understandably so). I was in despair. One day, I found out from a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's friend that the night before there had been a big selection at the ghetto. a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's family had actually been among those chosen to be sent to Wilno but at the last minute a Gestapo chief had decided to keep back a Gestapo chief's workers. Every single day, there was - 3 - a chance that this could happen again. I had run out of strength and had no idea what I should do next. I got in touch with a young geography professor, Mr Kola Taranowski, who agreed that Wilno could stay with a young geography professor, Mr Kola Taranowski, who agreed that Lilka could stay with him for a few days until I had managed to get hold of the travel permits. However, there was simply nowhere to get forged permits from and the truck from Wilno didn\'t materialise either. Suddenly, events moved forward at such a speed that it seemed to me that I had lost all control of the situation and was somehow stuck on a mill wheel. I found a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska at a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's friend\'s apartment filled with despair and desperation because they were expecting another \'cleansing\' at the ghetto the following night. This meant that a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska could not go back there. The professor who had already taken in Wilno and a few other Jews agreed to offer a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska a safe haven for a few hours. (a young geography professor, Mr Kola Taranowski, who agreed that Lilka could stay with him and a young geography professor, Mr Kola Taranowski, who agreed that Lilka could stay with him's beautiful young wife were later killed by the Germans because of the help a young geography professor, Mr Kola Taranowski, who agreed that Lilka could stay with him offered to the Jews.) Physically exhausted, I ran to see various acquaintances and begged various acquaintances to give a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska somewhere to stay for one night. But I had no luck whatsoever. Tears were frozen to my face as I went back to a young geography professor, Mr Kola Taranowski, who agreed that Lilka could stay with him's home one night having failed in my mission. That kind, brave man agreed to let a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska stay with a young geography professor, Mr Kola Taranowski, who agreed that Lilka could stay with him until the next day. In the morning, I continued with my pilgrimage with a heavy heart. However, this time some friends of my husband said some friends of my husband were willing to take a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska in for a few days. In the meantime, a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska actually had the opportunity to travel to Wilno illegally. I was due to find a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska there, where a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska would be staying with a Jew who was living at the rectory and working there as a gardener. So at this stage the situation got a little bit easier. I plucked up the courage to go to a Jew who was living at the rectory and working there as a gardener to get myself a travel permit. Luckily for me, a Jew who was living at the rectory and working there as a gardener spoke French, as I still couldn\'t speak a word of German back then. I explained to a Jew who was living at the rectory and working there as a gardener that I needed to return to my husband, who was a head forester, and a Jew who was living at the rectory and working there as a gardener issued a permit in my name without any trouble at all. When I reached the door, I turned around and casually said, with a smile on my face: \'Oh, I almost forgot! Could you add ""plus child"" please?\' Without any hesitation, a Jew who was living at the rectory and working there as a gardener wrote \'one child\' on the slip and that was that. Now I would be able to take a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska to Wilno with me! The very next day, the two of Masza and I boarded the train. I was incredibly nervous. Would Masza and I manage to be reunited in the home Masza and I longed to reach? Or would Masza and I be caught and shot? Would Masza and I find Masza in Wilno? What would my husband say when I arrived home with a Jewish woman and girl rather than Ms B., who I had promised to collect? These questions just kept going round and round in my head. Luckily, a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska followed my advice on the train and spoke to the other people on board as little as possible. the other people on board would have undoubtedly recognised a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's Jewish accent immediately. Once Masza and I reached Wilno, I again found myself looking for Masza and it took hours. It transpired that the Jewish \'gardener\' didn\'t live at the rectory at all and then had been too scared to let Masza stay with him, so Masza was forced to go to the ghetto in Wilno. When Masza was there, Masza was given the address of a midwife, who offered Masza a place to stay in the end. That was where Masza and I found Masza. Masza was very distressed, having lost almost all hope of seeing Masza and I again. Not to mention that there was a huge risk of being betrayed on either the Christian or Jewish side. a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and I spent the night at the rectory and the next - 4 - day Masza joined Masza and I, so Masza and I could all travel back home together in a truck. The priests were privy to everything that was happening and were nothing but friendly and kind. her daughter Lilka slept closely by my side and I felt like a second mother to her daughter Lilka given that I wanted to give her daughter Lilka back the gift of life. The next day, I had to continue to fight for Masza and I's lives. I had found out from The priests that the Germans would be searching every single vehicle on the roads thoroughly since you needed a permit if you wished to travel. But, of course, a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska did not have one. The priests also told me that on several occasions the Germans had found Jews and then shot all of the passengers in a truck without a second thought. The priests prepared a wonderful feast ready for when a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska arrived wrapped up in a huge piece of cloth like a peasant. Masza, who had spent the past few months of a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's life feeling like a deer being hunted, now felt as though a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska had stepped right into a dream as a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska sat down at the beautifully laid table and joined in conversations with a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's fellow companions... a truck arrived later that afternoon and a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska said goodbye to The priests. Outwardly, I was silent but this was because the \'inner me\' was stuck in a trance. I had spotted a young geography professor, Mr Kola Taranowski, who agreed that Lilka could stay with him's driver out in the courtyard and kept a close eye on everything that was playing out in front of me. When the mayor\'s driver saw a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her daughter Lilka near a truck, the mayor\'s driver's eyes widened. But before the mayor\'s driver had time to utter a single word I had slipped a litre bottle of vodka, which I had prepared for precisely this situation, into the mayor\'s driver's pocket and called to a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska to hurry up. I joined them in a truck and introduced Masza as my friend to a few people I knew. I then instinctively hid her daughter Lilka back in the dark corner so her daughter Lilka wouldn\'t be easy to spot. Every time a truck stopped even for a split second, I thought that must be it – the Germans would be there to check and it would all be over. a truck came to a halt and I stared as though hypnotised into the tarpaulin that was now being lifted up. To my relief, I saw that it was the mayor – the owner of a truck. the mayor – the owner of the truck said hello to me and then looked surprised when the mayor – the owner of the truck spotted a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her daughter Lilka. Before the mayor – the owner of the truck could speak, though, I quickly began to tell the mayor – the owner of the truck – in great detail – all about what it was like in Wilno and I explained that I had just brought my friend back home with me. the mayor – the owner of the truck said Masza\'s friend knew about this and had promised my husband that Masza\'s friend would give me a ride. But the mayor – the owner of the truck then went on to point out that I in fact had Masza and her daughter Lilka with me. I quickly replied, countering the mayor – the owner of the truck's point with a laugh and by saying that there was indeed just one woman and her daughter Lilka was no more than a child. the mayor – the owner of the truck finished by asking whether the mayor – the owner of the truck was right to assume that Masza and I had Masza and I's travel permits with Masza and I. I confirmed immediately that of course that was the case. the mayor – the owner of the truck went back to the author - a Polish Christian - at that point and, to my relief, Masza and I started moving again. My nerves still didn\'t let up for a single second. I kept the people I knew in a truck busy by talking to them a lot so they didn\'t have chance to concern themselves with a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her daughter Lilka. The police commandant, who was heading in the same direction as Masza and I, did start to talk to her daughter Lilka, however. a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and I were absolutely petrified because her daughter Lilka didn\'t speak very good Polish (her daughter Lilka went to a Jewish school), but her daughter Lilka carefully considered every word and didn\'t make a single mistake. The journey seemed to Masza and I to be lasting forever. a truck stopped frequently, almost making my heart stop every time, but Masza and I were lucky enough to avoid checks by the Germans. Masza and I finally arrived at the destination Masza and I were so desperate to reach late at night and it took Masza and I 10 minutes to get home from there. My husband was thrilled to see me again. To start with, her husband didn\'t - 5 - notice anything in particular about a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska because it was dark. her husband just thought that I\'d brought someone else I knew back with me instead. It wasn\'t until after we\'d had supper that her husband came to speak to me in the kitchen. With a look of fear on her husband's face, her husband said to me: \'She\'s a Jew, isn\'t she?\' I stayed calm and collected, replying with a simple yes. My husband soon accepted the situation and welcomed a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska in as part of the whole family. I was so grateful to her husband for her husband's reaction and I had already decided that if the Germans found out about what Masza and I were doing, I would say that my husband had no idea that a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska was Jewish. The first few months were extremely challenging. Masza and I spent hours trying to come up with ways Masza and I could make a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's face, hairstyle and clothing as a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska as possible, but Masza and I didn\'t have much luck. Whenever I introduced a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska to people, I could see it in people's eyes straight away that people knew the truth... It was even worse because Masza and I's house seemed to be full of all kinds of people all day long. The table was more or less set constantly. Masza and I were in a very dangerous situation now, as word had gotten around that a Jewish woman was living with the head forester (Masza and I's \'good friends\' had discussed it amongst themselves and decided that we had been given a lot of gold for what we were doing). In many other cases, the Germans had heard rumours of this kind and started investigations, which had led the Germans to visit houses under suspicion and kill everyone living there without any further consideration. The woman living in Masza and I's house with her daughter Lilka's daughter[2] posed a huge risk too. her daughter Lilka had not had a very good education and it was hard work for me to get her daughter Lilka to learn anything during her daughter Lilka's Polish lessons – her daughter Lilka simply didn\'t want to follow her Polish lessons. (Afterwards, her daughter Lilka was an extremely kind-hearted and well-behaved girl.) I must have a sixth sense, as the first thing I did was teach her daughter Lilka the \'Ave Maria\'. I also told her daughter Lilka that if anyone ever asked her daughter Lilka how her daughter Lilka knew the prayer, her daughter Lilka should tell them that her daughter Lilka's grandmother taught her daughter Lilka the prayer when her daughter Lilka was just a little girl. It just so happened that a few days later Masza and I's neighbour\'s children asked her daughter Lilka whether her daughter Lilka knew this very prayer. her daughter Lilka was able to recite this very prayer and the children then went on to ask her daughter Lilka how her daughter Lilka knew this very prayer. And her daughter Lilka knew exactly what to say. But this just went to show that people had people's suspicions about Masza and I's house. At least the neighbours had been reassured that her daughter Lilka was in fact a Christian child. Common folk on the whole posed less of a threat since Common folk on the whole weren\'t so sensitive to people being different or not having a pure accent given that Common folk on the whole had Common folk on the whole's own ways and mannerisms. There certainly were some people, though, who noticed even the slightest of nuances in speech and behaviour. some people, though, who noticed even the slightest of nuances in speech and behaviour were the ones who could soon turn into enemies... The winter passed by and a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska worked really hard on running the whole family. By the time summer arrived, Masza and I had a little more to eat, but Masza and I were living in truly turbulent times. During the day, Masza and I had to fear the Germans. When night fell, the Germans went on a rampage, killing people at random and burning houses down to the ground. For weeks, my husband either slept in the barn[3] or stayed with friends and people Masza and I knew. I never went to bed without a revolver, a garden shovel and a kitchen knife, so I had a chance of defending myself if it came to it. In the middle of - 6 - August, my husband was arrested with a group of people. A Gestapo inspector Masza and I knew intervened and my husband was released together with a few others (in other areas everyone that was arrested was shot without exception). Even in the face of all of this danger, there was still no question in my mind that a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her daughter Lilka should continue to stay with Masza and I. The overnight raids by the Germans had become so frequent by this point that I was a complete nervous wreck. Masza and I decided to move to Wilno for a while so Masza and I would \'only\' have to be worried about the Germans and The overnight raids by the Russian partisans. Masza and I managed to find two tiny little rooms in the suburbs. a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska carried on working temporarily as an office assistant to the second head forester, but a few weeks later her daughter Lilka got a phone call and the person on the other end of the line asked for her daughter Lilka by her daughter Lilka's real name... her daughter Lilka had no choice but to leave immediately. The place Masza and I were staying in Wilno was around 100 m away from the Gestapo building and there was a steady stream of strangers at Masza and I's home. Full of despair, I turned to the commander of the Polish Resistance for help. the commander of the Polish resistance movement was in fact able to offer the commander of the Polish resistance movement's assistance and arranged for a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska to live on a farm, pretending to be the wife of a Polish officer. However, it wasn\'t long before a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her daughter Lilka had to be moved to another farm. When it didn\'t work out there either, Masza and her daughter Lilka came back to me in Wilno. After another few weeks, Masza and I managed to place a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska, still in the guise of a Polish officer's wife, with her daughter Lilka in a large home as a gardener. her daughter Lilka stayed there for a few months, sharing a large room with her daughter Lilka and having plenty to eat. her daughter Lilka even travelled to Wilno once all alone on a horse and cart to visit me. Unfortunately, Masza and I's luck didn\'t last long and rumours soon started to spread around the area that a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska was a Jew. As far as I was concerned, Masza and I had no choice but to have them stay with Masza and I in Masza and I's two little rooms again. The situation Masza and I were in now was enormously dangerous. Gestapo was very close by; my husband had a lot of people visit her husband for business, including Germans, and Masza and I still had a large number of strangers coming to Masza and I's home. But I still couldn\'t just send a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her daughter Lilka away. And so Masza and her daughter Lilka stayed with Masza and I until the very end. The ghettos in all of the towns in the local area were in \'liquidation\'. Masza and I could hear nothing but gunshots from every direction. Everyone who came to visit Masza and I filled Masza and I in on the details... Masza and I were all shocked and upset, but Masza and I had to keep playing the part convincingly and seem to the outside world that Masza and I were indifferent, so as to mitigate any suspicion Masza and I may have been under. As I had done many times before, I had to brush off the comments of all the people who would say \'Marysia is a Jew, isn\'t she?\' with a laugh as if all the people who would say \'Marysia is a Jew, isn\'t she?\' with a laugh as if they had told a funny joke had told a funny joke. With a view to wiping out all suspicion entirely, a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska spoke really angrily about these comments the next day at the kitchen, forcing some of the men there to apologise to a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska. a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska had decided to travel to Russia with her daughter Lilka, as a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska would be able to get by more easily there. a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska's husband, who had been rescued when the ghetto in Wilno was liquidated and was now living in hiding, had agreed to this new plan. So, a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her daughter Lilka travelled to Konstanz, meaning Masza and her daughter Lilka were closer to the Swiss border. Two weeks later, her daughter Lilka was bombed very heavily by the Germans. Going - 7 - back to Masza and her daughter Lilka's house in Russia wasn\'t an option for Masza and her daughter Lilka, as Gestapo was searching for my husband. Masza and her daughter Lilka's response was to flee to Warsaw and Masza and her daughter Lilka were taken in by some friends living near to Warsaw. I had ventured into Warsaw at the moment that the insurrection broke out and I couldn\'t turn back. I didn\'t see my husband again. I was taken from Warsaw to Breslau as a slave labourer. I fled from there and made my way to Konstanz, where I hoped to find a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska and her daughter Lilka. a Jewish prompter, Masza Perewoska was working very hard for a gardener in Konstanz and I had no choice but to work in a factory. I got an extremely serious case of pleurisy but I still had to go to work despite suffering from a fever with a temperature of 39 degrees. The German doctor wouldn\'t give me any medicine either, so I believed I was going to die. I had no strength left in me. Luckily, in spring, with the French very close, Switzerland opened Switzerland's borders, meaning Masza and her daughter Lilka were able to leave Russia.

33,"['Heinz Samuel, Heinz Samuel's parents, sister and brother Werner were deported from Krefeld to the ghetto in Riga on 15 December 1941. Two days before Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's arrival there 35,000 Latvian Jews had been slaughtered in the same rooms now occupied by the new arrivals. After a week in Riga, the brothers Heinz Samuel and brother Werner were sent to Salaspils camp for 8 months, there 12,000 Jews out of 20,000 had been murdered. A notorious mass-murderer in the ghetto in Riga was Oberstf. Krause (November 1943). brother Werner and Heinz Samuel were transported to Camp Dondangen, Vernichtungslager. Heinz Samuel worked for the Armee-Bekleidungsamt. SS Dr. Krebsbach selected the inmates for the annihilation camp Stutthof, only 200 out of 1,500 inmates remained in the camp of the Armee-Bekleidungsamt. Hauptscharführer Bruener was the notorious commandant of the camp Libau where to Heinz Samuel had been sent. From there Hauptscharführer Bruener was transported to Hamburg and remained for 7 weeks in Fuehlsbuettel concentation camp. A new transfer took Hauptscharführer Bruener to C.C. Kiel, the commandant there SS Stf. Baumann demonstrated every night Hauptscharführer Bruener's shooting-practice by killing 30 inmates. On 1 May 1945 the Danish Red Cross (Swedish?) liberated the completely exhausted inmates. 4. Date : December 1941 - 1 May 1945. 5. Number of pages : 4. 6. Author or Source : Heinz Samuel. 7. Recorded by : as above.Heinz Samuel: Experiences in Concentration Camps in Latvia On the 11th of December 1941, We men were deported from Krefeld to Riga. We men's luggage, which We men had with We men, was completely taken away. Two days before We men's arrival in the ghetto in Riga, something dreadful had taken place. Out of 40,000 Latvian Jews, only 5000 were left there. All the others were executed by the governing authorities with the help of the Latvian SS. We men found the apartments in a devastated condition and had to wade through the blood of those murdered. To report on all of this is too much. Before We men had settled into the ghetto in Riga, there were still more victims. At the beginning, there were 17 of We men accommodated in a small room. The question of food gave We men a lot of concern. We men received rations for 14 days which only sufficed for two. We men attempted through bartering to obtain a bit more. But for bartering stood the death penalty. Numerous people were hanged or shot for this offense. We men had to make a 7 hour march to the port in snow and ice and carry out heavy work there. We men's food was frozen turnips which We men found. When We men returned from work, hungry children stood at the fence and waited for a piece of bread or turnip which perhaps would be taken into the ghetto in Riga at the risk of one’s life. We men's dear father, who was suffering from severe heart problems, did not have to work. On the 22nd of December 1941, brother Werner and I went with a large transport of men into the well-known death camp Salaspils, 17 kilometres from Riga. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner took Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's leave from Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's relatives with heavy hearts. The majority marched unsuspectingly to our relatives with heavy hearts's deaths. Of 20,000 people, 12,000 met their deaths in a mass grave. Vermin, the lack of any possibility to wash and completely inadequate nutrition were the causes of numerous hangings and shootings. On the 11th of April 1942, even Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's Werner was sentenced to hang because brother Werner had money with brother Werner at a control check, but thank God, brother Werner was reprieved at the last minute because Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner were liked by the camp leadership. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's boxing gloves, which Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner always carried with Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner, brought Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner some advantage. This hell, without any news of Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's loved ones, lasted for 8 months. Then the rest of Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner returned half-dead to the ghetto in Riga. Meanwhile, We men's dear father had died through starvation. We men's mother and younger sister were very thin; the hunger was too great. Many of We men's friends never found Many of our friends's relatives; Many of our friends had been dragged off by the Latvian SS and eliminated. Mother had also been selected, but was released. Many transports, which came to Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner, were led directly from the tracks to the woods and disposed of in a mass grave by machine guns and hand grenades. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's friends had to dig out a mass grave the day before under tight security. In the ghetto in Riga, there were 15,000 people from Cologne, Dusseldorf, Prague, Vienna, Berlin etc. 13,000 men and women went in columns to individual SS and military units for heavy work. There were daily shootings and hangings. Mother worked in the ghetto in Riga and took care of the household of 8 people amongst whom were also Mally Kaufman, Paula Davids and Julius Winter 3. Sister Ruth worked in a big scrapyard and had to unload heavy iron parts. Sister Ruth requested that I go there and I was put to use there as a welder. Above all, the possibility existed of a piece of bread or other food, which I received in recognition for my work from the Latvian workers and took home to our loved ones. The joy was great, but even greater was the danger bringing a piece of bread or other food, which I received in recognition for my work from the Latvian workers and took home to our loved ones into the ghetto in Riga. We men's mother and sister recovered again very well and Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner lived very happily together, apart from the anxiety which Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner had daily, when Obersturmführer simply took innocent people, mainly mothers who had to feed innocent people, mainly mothers who had to feed their children's children, to the cemetery and shot innocent people, mainly mothers who had to feed their children because of food abuse.At the beginning of June 1943, a lot of Jews were sent to Torf. Sister Ruth had to go. I was reclaimed as a skilled worker and was able to remain with my mother and sister. At this time, a new concentration camp was constructed in Riga Kaiserwald. Bit by bit, the ghetto in Riga was shut down. It was the first time that Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner were split up. I would have liked to have gone with Obersturmführer voluntarily, but, on the other hand, I also did not want to leave my mother and sister alone. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner took Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's leave with heavy hearts and cried like children. brother Werner had luck this time and was the camp eldest in the death camp Dondangen. My ‘command’ was also disbanded and I had luck; I was assigned to the Military Clothing Authority as a plumber. the Military Clothing Authority stayed to the last in the ghetto in Riga, and so I was able to continue with Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's life together. Only through my job was I able to manage to release my mother and sister from the horrible camp. Kaiserwald. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner often had to unload quarantine trains day and night. Sister Ruth came back from Torf with a septic leg on the 24th of October 1943. In the meantime, Sister Ruth's parents were no longer here. Sister Ruth brought food with Sister Ruth, which Sister Ruth had earned after work through tailoring for the director of the Torf factory. In between that, We men's little sister went by command to the military hospital. It was 4 hours walking, but our little sister came home proudly in the evening with bread and potatoes in our little sister's rucksack, which our little sister received as a present there and felt like the ‘bread-winner’ of the family. It is terrible what the ‘bread-winner’ of the family had to do through those horrible years. After I was sick in January with diphtheria, it went well with Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner until the dreadful November of 1943. When I came home from work, I found a deadly silence in the ghetto in Riga, instead of happy children greeting happy children greeting their parents and brother and sisters from work's parents and brother and sisters from work. Here and there was a light burning and I heard horrible weeping and howling. When I entered Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's flat, I discovered the entire house in the same circumstances as Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner found the entire house in December 1941, but mother and sister were not there. I ran round the entire house, and looked, but in vain. After a long time, I found Sister Ruth again. Sister Ruth had sought accommodation with Mendel from Kempen who was a witness to the events of the day. At 8 o’clock in the morning, there came the order for all children and old people to report. After that, the ghetto in Riga had to fall in. all children and old people were driven from the houses by the Latvian SS with revolvers drawn. all children and old people had to go to the muster place for ‘selection’ by the murderer Krause. The fate of all children and old people was decided by a nod of the head of the murderer Krause. all children and old people had to immediately climb in to large vehicles and were loaded into train wagons. From there, there was no trace. Many young mothers hid Many young mothers's children and gave their children sleeping powder to avoid any screaming or crying, but most of their children were discovered by the criminals. The general mood in the ghetto in Riga was now terrible. The few people who remained, had lost almost all of The few people who remained's relatives. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner remained in the ghetto in Riga until the 6th of November 1943, and then were quartered at the Military Clothing Authority. People, who had children under 10, had to remain in the ghetto in Riga, and in a repeat action, went the same way as Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's loved ones. We, who were assigned to the Military Clothing Authority, had to all be registered via the Kaiserwald Camp. There, many of Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner were retained and badgered by the criminals. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner arrived in the camp of the Military Clothing Authority. The work was very difficult and rations were scarce. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner bartered the clothes of Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's loved ones in order not to die of hunger. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner put on very thin prisoner uniforms. Both men and women had Both men and women's hair cut off completely. Sister Ruth went twice to the military hospital with a high fever and came home. I secretly left camp and begged in a neighbouring house for medicine and food. I wanted to give Sister Ruth the shirt that I still wore, but Sister Ruth said that God would reward Sister Ruth for the shirt that I still wore. Then another bad day came. The last children who were still with Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner, were fetched by the Latvian SS. There were terrible scenes. The parents had to hand over to the Latvian SS The parents's own children. Small children, who were sometimes smuggled illegally and with difficulty from the ghetto in Riga into the camp of the Military Clothing Authority, now ended up in the wood, where so many of Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's fellow Jews found their death. When the Russians came, once again an ‘Action’ took place and 76 people from Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's camp This selection 76 people from our camp's death. This selection was done by SS Doctor Kräbsbach. After This selection, Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's camp was reduced from 1500 to 200 people. All the rest were sent to the well-known death camp Stutthof. Again, most relatives were snatched away. However, through satisfactory work which pleased the criminals, Sister Ruth and I managed to be one of the last selected. 140 people went by boat to Torf; also Sister Ruth had to go. 50 men and 10 women remained behind. After 14 days, Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner also went to Torf, and joined again with 140 people. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's commander now was Hauptscharführer Brüner who also had a lot of people on Our commander's conscience. By now, there were heavy air raids by the Russians. Half of Sister Ruth's face was burnt by an incendiary bomb which fell in the slit trench. After an operation on my hand, I was assigned as a heating engineer and often had to work through the night. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner stayed in Torf until the 19th of February 1945 and then Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner were transported by ship to Hamburg. After, Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner were transferred by the Latvian SS to the prison of the Concentration Camp Fühlsbüttel. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner stayed for 7 weeks in the ghetto in Riga. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's strength ebbed away from day to day. 60 of Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's comrades were sent to Bergen-Belsen. On the 14th of April 1945, Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner had to fall in. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner were given 750 grams of bread and 100 grams of margarine which had to last for 4 days. Immediately after 4 days, Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner marched 100 kilometres to Kiel, supervised by the Latvian SS. The first day, Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner walked 30 kilometres. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner could barely move because Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's bodies were already too weak from previous exertions. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner fed Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner only on turnips which Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner found, and even for turnips which we found there were kicks and blows. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner arrived there after 4 days. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner were greeted with the words from the SS Führer and camp commander “You synagogue servants will have it good with the SS Führer”. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner had to undertake exhumation work in bomb damaged house in Kiel, and during exhumation work, Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner were treated disgracefully. Every evening the SS Führer displayed the SS Führer's shooting ability, and as a result, 30 camp inmates had to die. 30 camp inmates were now only skeletons, and Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner were so far gone that Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's legs could hardly carry Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's legs and feet were badly swollen with water. On the 30th of April Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner had to this action on the dirty and blood-stained clothing of those who had been shot the previous evening. With this action, Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner did not see anything good for Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner because many comrades had already had to take many comrades's last walk in torn clothes. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner were already too indifferent to think. Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner had no strength left for life or death. Then an unbelievable miracle happened for Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner. the Danish Red Cross (Swedish?) fetched Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner the next day, the 1st of May 1945, out of the hell the memory of which will be with Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner for the rest of Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's lives, and took Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner to a priceless freedom. This report is only a fraction of Heinz Samuel, his parents, sister and brother Werner's frightful experiences.

34,"['When the author and the author's two brothers tried to escape from the unbearable conditions in the KZ Kaiserwald and the author and his two brothers's work in the Ortskommadantur, the author and his two brothers were caught and sent to ABA 701 (forced labour). There the author and his two brothers had to suffer cruel punishments and sadistic atrocities; the author accuses the “Unteroffiziere” Müller and Schwellenbach. Dr. Josef, Lagerarzt, would warn Schwellenbach in vain of the possibly fatal consequences of Schwellenbach's cruelty. the author declares the author ready to repeat the author's statement under oath before any magistrate. Evidence Against “Unteroffizier” Franz Schwellenbach Stockholm, 3 September 1947. Regarding: Testifying against “Unteroffizier” Franz Schwellenbach when “Unteroffizier” Franz Schwellenbach served in Riga. The signatory hereby states that The signatory has provided a truthful report on Schwellenbach's character as evidence of how Schwellenbach behaved in an inhumane manner. The signatory had to experience first hand the disgraceful deeds that Schwellenbach was capable of. I am ready to repeat this statement under oath before any magistrate at any time. At the time in question, my two brothers and I were taken from the KZ Kaiserwald Concentration Camp near Riga every day to work in the Ortskommadantur. Life in Kaiserwald Concentration Camp near Riga and where my two brothers and I worked was unbearable. This prompted my two brothers and I to put an end to Life in the concentration camp and where we worked once and for all by our attempt from Life in the concentration camp and where we worked. Unfortunately, my two brothers and I's attempt was unsuccessful and my two brothers and I were sent to the Army Clothing Centre 701, which was also in Riga, for forced labour. Once they had brought my two brothers and I to the Army Clothing Centre 701, which was also in Riga, for forced labour, the commandant of Kaiserwald Concentration Camp near Riga, Unteroffizier Mueller, gave my two brothers and I 25 lashes each, and then continued to strike my two brothers and I. my two brothers and I were then sent to the forced labour group; Schwellenbach was the head of the forced labour group. Despite receiving my two brothers and I's punishments from Müller, this did not seem to be enough for Schwellenbach, and Schwellenbach set about persecuting my two brothers and I in dreadful ways. Schwellenbach tortured my two brothers and I using every trick in the book, including making my two brothers and I carry a large stack of wood (beams), which were 5 metres in length, for approx. 500 metres at a run. At this stage, I would like to emphasise that this was not work that needed to be done – its sole purpose was to torture my two brothers and I. my two brothers and I were working in 30 degree heat and {my two brothers and I} were close to collapsing. If my two brothers and I were unable to keep up with the pace at any point, through no fault of my two brothers and I's own as my two brothers and I were weak, Schwellenbach would relentlessly beat my two brothers and I with a truncheon. The less my two brothers and I could stand the pace as time went by, the more Schwellenbach would beat my two brothers and I. This ended with my two brothers and I fainting and collapsing, covered in blood. You would have thought that this would be the end of it. - 2 - On the contrary, my two brothers and I's Lagerarzt (camp doctor), Dr Josef, came and could see Schwellenbach knelt over my two brothers and I after my two brothers and I had collapsed, punching my two brothers and I, etc. in an effort to bring my two brothers and I round to consciousness. our Lagerarzt (camp doctor), Dr Josef told Schwellenbach that my two brothers and I's lives were at risk, so Schwellenbach then threw buckets of water over my two brothers and I. our Lagerarzt (camp doctor), Dr Josef was not able to attend to my two brothers and I at all as Schwellenbach could not be deterred from Schwellenbach's actions in any way. Schwellenbach sprained Schwellenbach's foot when Schwellenbach kicked my two brothers and I – this was the only thing my two brothers and I have to thank for this procedure being brought to an end. On the many occasions that my two brothers and I lay there unconscious, Schwellenbach would use water to try and bring my two brothers and I round. water actually worked, but each time water indicated to Schwellenbach that Schwellenbach should start beating my two brothers and I again. Once it got to the point where nobody would have believed my two brothers and I were still alive, Schwellenbach dragged my two brothers and I into a dark basement, where my two brothers and I had to lie in the most awful conditions. my two brothers and I were forbidden from having any medical assistance whatsoever. Although I laid there for a while with a high fever, and continued to be persecuted by Schwellenbach in every way imaginable, I believe it was down to fate that I am still here today to testify against Schwellenbach. My case, and that of my brothers, is not an isolated incident. There is evidence that Schwellenbach, without any authorisation, treated us Jews in such an inhumane manner out of pure personal pleasure. I hope that Schwellenbach receives just punishment.

This report includes details of an execution in the presence of 20,000 prisoners of an internee who had tried to escape and was caught. From the gallows an internee who had tried to escape and was caught greeted an internee who had tried to escape and was caught's fellow-sufferers with a laugh, whilst an internee who had tried to escape and was caught was shuddering at an internee who had tried to escape and was caught's task (p.5-6). 9. References : 10. Remarks : The author died in London in 1949. I.'s Experience in the Concentration Camps Dachau And Buchenwald A short extract of I.'s martyrdom and of I.'s frightful experiences in the hell of the concentration camps Dachau and Buchenwald in which I. was nine months long a prisoner. I. will begin with I.'s arrest in Vienna on 28 May 1938. This was in the early morning, when a man in plain clothes sought I. out in I.'s parents home and summoned I. in a friendly tone to accompany a man in plain clothes, telling I. it was a question of supplying a little information, and I. should return home in about half an hour. a man in plain clothes brought I. to the police station, where I. was only asked if I. were a Jew, and on saying “Yes” was thrown into prison, where there were already several hundreds, who knew no more than I. But this mob had no longer to wait, the first transport was soon sent off, in which I. found I.. There were about 700 of this mob, driven in armoured cars to the otherwise peaceful West-Station. The next picture was one of the most terrible. this mob were crowded in the cars like animals, and placed round the otherwise peaceful West-Station were S.S. men armed with machine guns, who now set about this mob with S.S. men armed with machine guns, who now set about us with their hand weapons, until they had established a blood bath's hand weapons, until S.S. men armed with machine guns, who now set about us with their hand weapons, until they had established a blood bath had established a blood bath. When more than half experienced wounding - and several were dead - the death train left the otherwise peaceful West-Station. This found I. with a broken finger and four teeth missing. As yet, however, the worst was to come, when later the beasts started on this mob in the death train. this mob were ordered by the sodden barbarians to gaze in the glaring light (sun) during the whole journey. Obviously this was impossible, and this mob were then treated to blows, kicks and shots, until this mob were almost insane. However this mob got to Munich is still a puzzle to I. today. Yet it was so. As this mob alighted this mob were treated much about the same as this mob were when on the Station at Vienna. From Munich to Dachau this mob were dispatched in cattle trucks. this mob were lucky to have such gloomy trucks as cattle trucks, for not one of the cowardly hounds would enter. this mob were choked with blood and sweat and nearly unconscious from thirst when this mob reached this hell. It was almost like a funeral, for as this mob marched to the gates of Dachau Camp, this mob carried the dead bodies of those who had suffered at the - 2 - Murderers’ hands, at the head of the procession. After a short roll- call of the murdered, Grunewald, the Camp commandant addressed this mob, wherein Grunewald, the Camp commandant intimated that the guns of the beasts of guard go off quite easily. this mob were shorn bald, and brought into barracks. this mob then received rough convict uniform, and at last, after more than 40 hours torture, were given food and drink and the opportunity to lie down on straw. A short sleep and then off to work. “Work” is a fine word. Off on a torture trip. this mob each carried a stone block of 30-40 kgs.(about 4 stones and a half to five stones) weight, which this mob had to carry the whole day long on dusty roads, temperature often 40 deg Centigrade (about 110 deg. Farenheit) and without hats, so that this mob suffered a sunstroke. Numbers fell unconscious together. Numbers were roughly brought round with water, and must continue to walk. Bad enough this torture, but this torture wasn't yet the worst. One day this mob marched out, and formed a parade ground, in which was set up a block or post. The guards in full equipment arrived at a parade ground, in which was set up a block or post, and this mob saw a terrible picture - public whipping. With animal strength The guards in full equipment threshed helpless men, whose groans were heart-rending. After this devlish game, the Death's Head S.S. (guards) were grinning like devils. Such an unhappy experience as this torture happened to I., when after gruelling work I. fell unconscious. I. was brought before the dog Grunewald (commandant) and asked why I. had refused to work. To this nonsensical question I. could give no answer, and so the dog Grunewald (commandant) pronounced sentence - “Treehanging”. I.'s hands were bound with chains and I. was placed backwards to a tree trunk, and bound so high, that I.'s feet could not reach the ground. I. held this out for roughly 20 minutes and then cried out. This was a bad move for I. was whipped and placed higher on a tree trunk, and not released until 12 1/2 hours on the torture stake. To come out of this witches cauldron alive was quite exclusive; but besides these tortures, a little example of some of the other fine things this mob did. On one occasion a small piece of bread was found lying in a barrack. Punishment - twelve days “Torstehen” for all prisoners living in the vicinity. There were 2000 of this mob affected. By “Torstehen” the following - 3 - is meant. After tiring work and with hungry stomachs and thirsty throats, remain standing to attention until sufficiently punished - and that was roughly three hours. So this mob's food was delayed and shortened, with 30 days on half bread ration.- I. can forget this, but when I. think of the punishment exercises, I. still cry out - hopping, jumping, running, knees-bend, creeping on the floor, until this mob were exhausted. Anyone must see that not a day passed without many deaths. And now a trifle about the “good” watchmen. Some of the “good” watchmen had hardly passed Some of these tyrants's 18th year. I. was working in a pit, which was already over 4 metres (4 yards and a half) deep. When I. stopped to wipe the sweat from I.'s forehead I. heard a command which ordered I. to report to one of such youth. As quick as I. could I. jumped out of a pit, which was already over 4 metres (4 yards and a half) deep) and reported I. to one of such youth “Jew, in protective custody, reports obediently to one of such youth” I. said. This I. had to repeat until I. was even hotter? but it was still too soft for one of such youth. After this fine performance one of such youth asked I. why I. had come to one of such youth. “Because one of such youth called I.” was I.'s answer. “I. lie”, one of such youth said, and gave I. a blow, which knocked I. backwards into a pit, which was already over 4 metres (4 yards and a half) deep. “Now out of a pit, which was already over 4 metres (4 yards and a half) deep” one of such youth bellowed. I. sprang out in haste. What I. could have done to one of such youth then would have cost I.'s life, for I. was at the end of I.'s nerves. Yet this fine performance was put about ten times: like a fool I. jumped in and out - and this hound grinned. I. can still remember that malevolent grin today exactly. Another case, which did not concern I. but cost a dear friend of I. a dear friend of mine his life's life. We were stone-breaking when a dear friend of mine his life was ordered by a “Death- headman” to run to a dear friend of mine his life. What a dear friend of mine his life asked a dear friend of mine his life I. could not hear but I. heard a dear friend of mine his life's bellowing command: “March, march”. I.'s friend obeyed his bellowing command and the cowardly dog shot a bullet into the cowardly dog's head. The excuse, - attempting to escape, Comment, - superfluous. Of such episodes I. could write books, but I. will leave Dachau and write about the many fine ‘goings-on’ at Buchenwald, and about Buchenwald's commandant, because there can remain no secretabout the brutality which helpless people are subjected to in present Germany. Buchenwald may well be termed the worst camp in Germany, because the brutality and pitiless- - 4 - ness which are meted out there are not easily depicted in empty words. The criminal system on which Buchenwald is built can he seen and judged on entering Buchenwald. This transcription is written over the entrance: “Right or Wrong My Fatherland”. Horrible the first impression. There one saw a half-dead man before its commandant whipped on the post, two gigantic demons thrashing the poor fellow - frightful to behold a half-dead man. Yet a stroke and yet another but no sound came from a half-dead man, no movement to be seen. a half-dead man is dead. Only then do they yield to the corpse, no pity, no compassion. They bellow for two prisoners - the corpse is carried away. Yet another horrible sight is to be seen. A column passes by - broken men - they carry a band on the arm on which is written (bloed) “insane”. They carry a heavy burden of stone, one follows the other; they can hardly move a heavy burden of stone. No pity - a “Beath-Head” moves amongst them and cruelly whips them forward. Gan one liken these dogs to men? No - and again No. And this is where we must live. We have had already some experience and were quite apathetic; I. reckoned no more with I.'s life, because after human estimates my life was impossible. Little to eat, no drinking water (it was infected), no water in general; we could only wash once a week. Five men had to sleep on two straw sacks. Lousy blankets so that nearly all of us suffered from an eruption. And on top of this: the work, until late in the evening with no Sunday rest. Thus one day passed the same as the next? work-blows, work-blows. this mob were already used to work-blows, work-blows and feared only more horrible surprises. And what this mob feared promptly turned up. It was on November 3rd when a frightful order reached this mob: half rations, no medical facilities, no smoking, no letters. Buried alive. Every day this mob carried bodies from the rooms. I. was unfortunately in the body-carrying column. I. carried many friends out on I.'s shoulder, thinking: One day I. also shall be carried out, I. am nearing I.'s end. Yet the foregoing account is nothing to the unbelievable brutalities of 11th November, 1938 and the following weeks. It was the great round up of prisoners after the attempt on Rath in Paris. The bloodhounds arrested men, cripples, and even children of 11 and 12 years and brought men, cripples, and even children of 11 and 12 years to Dachau Camp. How The bloodhounds attacked men, cripples, and even children of 11 and 12 years is unbelievable. There was - 5 - not one of the more than 10,000 in Dachau Camp who had at least a hole in 5 - not one of the more than 10,000 in the camp who had at least a hole in his scalp's scalp. The roll-call place where 5 - not one of the more than 10,000 in the camp who had at least a hole in his scalp mustered ressembled a veritable blood bath. 5 - not one of the more than 10,000 in the camp who had at least a hole in his scalp were placed in provisional barracks; where 200 had previously been, 200 were packed. No taking off clothes, no washing, the food that was thrown to 5 - not one of the more than 10,000 in the camp who had at least a hole in his scalp eaten with the hands, picked from the filthy floor. In these conditions 5 - not one of the more than 10,000 in the camp who had at least a hole in his scalp lived for weeks. There was no lavatory accommodation for 5 - not one of the more than 10,000 in the camp who had at least a hole in his scalp and one just let nature take nature's course. An epidemic was unavoidable, and An epidemic came in truth; typhoid was rife in Dachau Camp. typhoid sounds terrible and so typhoid was indeed. Hundreds who became insane we had later to carry as corpses from the washrooms where we had put Hundreds who became insane. When children erred in Dachau Camp, the “Death—Heads” did the “Death—Heads”'s duty. The whip did not rest, - children were pitilessly whipped, thrashed, murdered, - children had never asked for it. And in conclusion of I.'s true pictures of the brutalities which are perpetrated in the present-day Germany, I. will yet open the eyes of the British people and tell of the execution of a man in the presence of more than 20,000 prisoners. Two prisoners broke out, one was quickly recaptured, the other fled to Chechoslovakia. The other, after short proceedings in Weimar, which is in the neighbourhood of Dachau Camp, was condemned to death and this the Gestapo determined to carry out in the camp Dachau Camp. It was the day before Christmas 1938. At 8 a.m. the signal went and a parading of 20,000 prisoners took place; in deep snow at 30 degrees Cels, (about 90 Farenehit under zero) we had to watch the horrible end to which one of our friends was to come. At attention in the piercing cold we stood, waiting for the next terrible minutes in our lives. We were so many, yet we could not help one of our friends. The threatening machine guns were trained on us and one move from any other of us would have cost many lives. The searchlights also pla, yed on us and in the middle of all this the gallows stood out. Soon we heard the words of the gangsters: “March one of our friends to the gallows”. And with sallow face and raised head, with quick steps went our friend Forster. Yet our friend Forster greeted us with a laught, while the “Leath-Heads” threatened us. The hangman, shaking, put the noose around the neck of the unfortunate, - indeed The hangman shook, for he was one of us, a - 6 - prisoner, and had to do the infamous act under the threats of the gallows. “Let him go” was intoned, and a few minutes later there dangled an innocent sacrifice of the German barbarian tyranny. “March—march” bellowed the gallows, - and the death struggle continued.

During the years 1943-44, Andrée Geulen-Herscovici took part in the rescue operation for Jewish children within the framework of the ‘Comité de défense des Juifs.’[1] 1 ‘CDJ’ organisation (Comité de défense des Juifs); 2 Personal responsibilities: Reception and placement of the children - Concealment of the illegal addresses, even when it came to the parents; 2 et seq. Episodes of Resistance work; 3 et seqq. Attempt by the adoptive parents[2] to prevent the return of the child; 5 et seqq. Further episodes: Rescue of the children in the Franciscan convent - Heroic conduct of the Ovart family - Evacuation of the children Homes[3] - Help from Belgian policemen[4] during the acquisition of ration cards. Early in 1943, at the time when the roundups of the Jews where increasing by the day, Andrée Geulen-Herscovici met - whilst at the home of some mutual friends - a social worker who asked Andrée Geulen-Herscovici if Andrée Geulen-Herscovici wanted to help hide Jewish children. Andrée Geulen-Herscovici said yes right away, and that is how Andrée Geulen-Herscovici ended up being part of the main aid organisation for Jews in Belgium during the last war: the CDJ (Comité de défense des Juifs). Within the ‘Comité de défense des Juifs, there were two sections: the ‘Adults’’ section and the ‘Children’s’ section, the ‘Children’s’ section dealing exclusively with the placement of children. The work was divided into three groups. The 1st group, directed by Madame Jospa, was tasked with searching for places either through official charities (Œuvre Nationale de l’Enfance, JOC, Aide Paysanne aux enfants des villes, Foyers Leopold III, etc…[5]) or with families, preferably far from the cities. That is how many children were taken in by peasants.[6] The 2nd group, the placement centre, directed by Ida Sterno, was responsible for visiting the Jewish families who were still at the family's official addresses and who were These appeals for the Resistance's help to take away as soon as possible the family's children who risked every day being rounded up. These appeals reached the placement centre through various Jewish organisations: the Zionist groups, l’Association des Juifs de Belgique[7] (an organisation under German control but where the Resistance had allies). After visiting the family in order to determine the age of their children who risked every day being rounded up and their children who risked every day being rounded up's physical traits (very important), the Resistance would place their children who risked every day being rounded up as and when places were found for the Resistance by the 1st group. The 3rd group carried out the administrative work. For each child, The 3rd group would create a false identity (after having noted down, by means of a code, each child's true identity as well as the address of the parents, locking everything in a strongbox) and a false ration card, noting the address of the caretakers or of the establishment where each child was hidden. A team of young girls would go visit the caretakers every month to bring ration stamps and to pay for their children who risked every day being rounded up keep. Andrée Geulen-Herscovici worked in The 3rd group, and it was Andrée Geulen-Herscovici's duty to go see the families who were asking for the Resistance's help. Andrée Geulen-Herscovici used to learn the names and addresses by heart in order to not make the Gestapo work easier, were Andrée Geulen-Herscovici to be arrested and searched, by giving them a list of addresses. the Resistance would ask the parents to prepare their children who risked every day being rounded up's suitcases and to keep their children who risked every day being rounded up ready. In some cases, the parents were asked to contribute financially. the Resistance would come by to pick up their children who risked every day being rounded up several days later, and the Resistance were to take their children who risked every day being rounded up either to convents, to Homes in Belgium or to Belgian families who had willingly accepted to hide their children who risked every day being rounded up. the Resistance never placed Jewish children who had strong Semitic traits in communal institutions, this so as to prevent Jewish children who had strong Semitic traits from being noticed too easily amongst the other children. When the Resistance took their children who risked every day being rounded up away, the Resistance never used to tell the parents where the Resistance were hiding their children who risked every day being rounded up. Andrée Geulen-Herscovici realise how cruel it could be for the parents to entrust the parents's children to an unknown woman (the Resistance obviously could not say who the Resistance were; the Resistance introduced the Resistance in the name of the Resistance) who would not even say where an unknown woman (we obviously could not say who we were; we introduced ourselves in the name of the Resistance was taking their children who risked every day being rounded up. But this was an indispensable precautionary measure since experience had taught the Resistance that, when the Resistance gave the addresses after forcing the parents to formally promise not to go see the addresses, the parents could not stop the parents from going and, by doing so, compromised the security of their children who risked every day being rounded up. the Resistance's organisation worked mainly in Brussels, but the Resistance also managed to hide children from Antwerp where a group had been formed under the direction of Mr Manaster.[8] Certain memorable episodes from this period. One day, Andrée Geulen-Herscovici was to take a two-year-old child, Charles S., to stay with some peasants in Wezeembeek.[9] Two children were already hidden there. Andrée Geulen-Herscovici was to pick Two children up again so as to take Two children to another Home. When Andrée Geulen-Herscovici arrived there, Andrée Geulen-Herscovici noticed that Two children had scabies. Clearly, Andrée Geulen-Herscovici did not leave a two-year-old child, Charles S. and took a two-year-old child, Charles S. to the pensionnat[10] where Andrée Geulen-Herscovici was staying so that Andrée Geulen-Herscovici could find a two-year-old child, Charles S. another place. The pensionnat was raided that very night, and a two-year-old child, Charles S. was taken to Malines. The orphaned children were not sent to the camps but were placed in officially recognised Jewish Homes. Maurice Heiber, who, at the time, was in Malines, was able to help the Resistance retrieve the child whom the Resistance then placed in the Hôpital St. Pierre under the pretext that the child whom we then placed in the Hôpital St. Pierre under the pretext that he had diphtheria had diphtheria. There, the child whom we then placed in the Hôpital St. Pierre under the pretext that he had diphtheria was made to ‘die.’ Then the child whom we then placed in the Hôpital St. Pierre under the pretext that he had diphtheria was placed with some gardeners under a false name…Today, the child whom we then placed in the Hôpital St. Pierre under the pretext that he had diphtheria is a big fifteen-year-old boy who is studying to become a dental technician. …After the liberation, all the children whose parents had not been deported were returned to all the children whose parents had not been deported's families. This went smoothly except for one boy whose mother almost never saw one boy whose mother almost never saw him again again. But the circumstances surrounding one boy whose mother almost never saw him again's placement had been particularly difficult, so, instead, just listen: one boy whose mother almost never saw him again, had been taken out of the camp in Malines, being entirely without a family (Madame Jospa had jumped from the Gestapo lorry that was taking Madame Jospa to the camp in Malines), and placed in another Home. No one knew one boy whose mother almost never saw him again's true identity, and one boy whose mother almost never saw him again was given one boy whose mother almost never saw him again's first new name. The director of another Home, Mr Tiefenbrunner, passed one boy whose mother almost never saw him again on to the Resistance's clandestine organisation. (Every now and then, that was how a child could avoid detection; twenty-nine children would be declared to the Germans when, in reality, there were thirty, and the thirtieth would be smuggled out.) the Resistance placed one boy whose mother almost never saw him again, under a second new name (this one, more French-sounding), with a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that one boy whose mother almost never saw him again was never visited. After the liberation, the mother - who had managed to stay hidden throughout the last war - came to claim one boy whose mother almost never saw him again from the Resistance…the mother - who had managed to stay hidden throughout the war had found out that one boy whose mother almost never saw him again had never been deported from Malines and had been hidden by our clandestine organisation, but the mother - who had managed to stay hidden throughout the war knew nothing ever since one boy whose mother almost never saw him again had left Malines. the mother - who had managed to stay hidden throughout the war gave the Resistance the true name of the child which was neither the first nor the second one the mother - who had managed to stay hidden throughout the war had received. Whence the Resistance's first difficulty, for nowhere in the Resistance's files figured the true name of one boy whose mother almost never saw him again. Essentially, through the help of multiple photos and due to the fact that one boy whose mother almost never saw him again had been operated on for an inguinal hernia, the Resistance realised that one boy whose mother almost never saw him again was the unknown child whom the Resistance had taken from the Home of The director of the Home, Mr Tiefenbrunner and placed with a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited. the Resistance went with Madame Jospa to where a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited was living, and, there, the Resistance heard that a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited had, in fact, had one boy whose mother almost never saw him again with a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited but had only kept one boy whose mother almost never saw him again for several months and, afterwards, had given one boy whose mother almost never saw him again back to our clandestine organisation. To whom? a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited could not give a name…a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited had not asked for a name when one boy whose mother almost never saw him again was brought to a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited; a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited still had not asked for a name when one boy whose mother almost never saw him again was taken away from a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited. Madame Jospa was desperate! No one within the Resistance's organisation remembered having been to take back one boy whose mother almost never saw him again, but many were those amongst the Resistance who had been deported. How were the Resistance to know? a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited had asked for neither stamps nor money; none of the ‘payeuses’[11] had gone to see one boy whose mother almost never saw him again since one boy whose mother almost never saw him again's placement. What were the Resistance to do? the Resistance placed a photo in the papers and made a public appeal whilst indicating the last known address, in other words, that of a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited. The response was not long in coming - the Resistance received a telephone call from the notaire, furious, who begged the Resistance to stop the Resistance's searches since the Fifth Column was still around and a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited did not want a bomb being placed where a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited lived because a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited had kept a Jewish child during the occupation. At the same time, a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited pointed out to the Resistance that a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited had lost a child during the last war, that a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited had well had to console a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited and that the mother of the Resistance's little missing boy just had to do the same. This last remark immediately roused the Resistance's suspicions and gave the Resistance the keen conviction that one boy whose mother almost never saw him again was still with a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited. Meanwhile, the Resistance had found out that a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited had a child staying with a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited who was the same age as the one whom the Resistance were searching for, a child whom a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited had adopted following the death of the parents during a bombing. Despite the Resistance's requests, a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited refused to show the Resistance one boy whose mother almost never saw him again. At this point, the Resistance decided to file a complaint and place the case in the hands of Justice. The judiciary police carried out a long inquiry, questioning the Resistance in turn; time passed, Madame Jospa began to despair of ever seeing Madame Jospa's child again. Finally, The judiciary police carried out a raid, on the same day, at the same time, on all the properties belonging to a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited, and one boy whose mother almost never saw him again was found again…three years had gone by. a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited and a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited's wife had grown extremely attached to one boy whose mother almost never saw him again, but who shall ever deny the cruelty of not returning a child to a child's true mother, especially after the suffering that Madame Jospa had endured during the last war. …In Place Bara, there was a back-room in a café where all the Jews used to hide during roundups. There was a denunciation, and everyone was arrested. The patronne of a café where all the Jews used to hide during roundups managed to save a little girl of about three or four. Andrée Geulen-Herscovici was made responsible at the time for picking up one boy whose mother almost never saw him again. As a little girl of about three or four was on the first floor, Andrée Geulen-Herscovici first took down a little girl of about three or four's suitcase. Having reached the corridor, Andrée Geulen-Herscovici found Andrée Geulen-Herscovici face-to-face with three men in civilian clothes, one of whom had one of whom had his arm in a sling's arm in a sling. three men in civilian clothes, one of whom had his arm in a sling asked for Andrée Geulen-Herscovici's papers which Andrée Geulen-Herscovici immediately handed over. Andrée Geulen-Herscovici pretended that Andrée Geulen-Herscovici had to make a telephone call and found out that the man with one of whom had his arm in a sling's arm in a sling was one of whom had his arm in a sling. one of whom had his arm in a sling had been injured by one of the men arrested in a café where all the Jews used to hide during roundups who had escaped from the transport and sworn to avenge one of the men arrested in the café who had escaped from the transport and sworn to avenge himself. In a café where all the Jews used to hide during roundups, there was unfortunately a couple that had also been able to escape from the transport, but they too had been arrested again. Madame Jospa had just enough time to give Andrée Geulen-Herscovici the address of Madame Jospa's little boy in Deux-Acren. What is more, Andrée Geulen-Herscovici had just been to see one boy whose mother almost never saw him again eight days earlier. Madame Jospa never came back. Andrée Geulen-Herscovici was interrogated for two hours; three men in civilian clothes, one of whom had his arm in a sling wanted to know if Andrée Geulen-Herscovici regularly went to see the Jews and if Andrée Geulen-Herscovici had any addresses to give the Jews. Finally, three men in civilian clothes, one of whom had his arm in a sling let Andrée Geulen-Herscovici leave. three men in civilian clothes, one of whom had his arm in a sling did not find one boy whose mother almost never saw him again, and the Resistance went to pick one boy whose mother almost never saw him again up later…On avenue Clémenceau, there was a group of French nuns who also used to shelter every now and then children whose parents had been arrested. At any given time, there were about a dozen children who shared the life of the religious community. Following a denunciation, the Gestapo came, but the Mother Superior managed to mollify the Gestapo by promising to dress about a dozen children who shared the life of the religious community, to have about a dozen children who shared the life of the religious community ready the following day. the Mother Superior immediately alerted the Resistance, the Resistance came to pick up about a dozen children who shared the life of the religious community, and the Resistance staged a scene, gagged a group of French nuns who also used to shelter every now and then children whose parents had been arrested, cut the telephone line. That evening when the Gestapo returned, the nuns were calling for help… …An act of heroism. In the pensionnat Gaty de Gamont, there were 17 hidden children and 13 adults in the attic. Following a denunciation, 17 hidden children and 13 adults in the attic was arrested. The directeur, the directrice[12] and The directeur, the directrice[12]'s daughter were put in prison; Mr and Mme Ovart were deported to Germany and never came back. Mr and Mme Ovart's daughter was, their daughter, in prison for more than a year. …One day, the Resistance received news from Malines informing the Resistance that Frank, who was head of the camp, had received a telegram ordering Frank, who was head of the camp to empty all the Homes of the C.D.J. (Comité de défense des Juifs). It was nearly the end of the occupation. the Resistance accomplished the tour de force of clearing out about a dozen children who shared the life of the religious community from all the Homes of the AJB in one day. When the German lorries arrived, the German lorries found all the Homes of the AJB empty. …The children who were taken in by the C.D.J. (Comité de défense des Juifs), for the most part, did not have ration cards. The children who were taken in by the organisation needed an attestation de résidence[13] to receive a new card. Andrée Geulen-Herscovici was made responsible for obtaining an attestation de résidence[13] for about fifty children from Antwerp. Everything was going well when, one day, during one of Andrée Geulen-Herscovici's excursions, Andrée Geulen-Herscovici had to grapple with an overzealous commissaire de police VNV[14] who interrogated Andrée Geulen-Herscovici, and Andrée Geulen-Herscovici had a hard time escaping from an overzealous commissaire de police VNV[14] who interrogated me's clutches. Andrée Geulen-Herscovici left this police station and sensed that Andrée Geulen-Herscovici was being followed.[15] As it turned out, a police officer who had witnessed the scene with an overzealous commissaire de police VNV[14] who interrogated me approached Andrée Geulen-Herscovici, held out an overzealous commissaire de police VNV[14] who interrogated me's card, and asked Andrée Geulen-Herscovici to come see an overzealous commissaire de police VNV[14] who interrogated me the following day at the Palais de Justice. Andrée Geulen-Herscovici went, feeling rather uneasy all the same, having already been arrested twice. an overzealous commissaire de police VNV[14] who interrogated me told Andrée Geulen-Herscovici that an overzealous commissaire de police VNV[14] who interrogated me was on friendly terms with an overzealous commissaire de police VNV[14] who interrogated me and suggested that the Resistance went together to see an overzealous commissaire de police VNV[14] who interrogated me so as to take care of all the papers which Andrée Geulen-Herscovici needed. No list necessary! How many do the Resistance need, a hundred? the Resistance will put the names the Resistance. And that is how Andrée Geulen-Herscovici came to acquire the precious cards by the sheerest of luck. What is more, Andrée Geulen-Herscovici found out after the last war that an overzealous commissaire de police VNV[14] who interrogated me had also been providing cards to a whole series of people in hiding. …Very often, whilst visiting the Jewish families, we would be caught in roundups; streets blocked off, soldiers at every corner with lorries to transfer the product of their hunt. Fortunately, nearly every time we managed to save a few children…one in a pram, two others by the hand…we would pass through the roadblocks, the soldiers making way for a mother with a large family…a few children were saved, as for the parents! [1] Committee for the Defence of the Jews. [2] Although the text uses the term ‘Adoptifeltern’ [adoptive parents] when referring to a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited and a notaire from Brussels who, asking for neither ration stamps nor money, explicitly requested that the child was never visited's wife, it is be more accurate to call The notaire and his wife ‘foster parents,’ especially seeing that The notaire and his wife were not technically granted official/legal custody of the child. [3] Note on the usage of ‘Home’ versus ‘home’: Apart from one instance where it was particularly challenging to avoid using ‘home’ in the sense of one’s general residence, the word ‘Home’ (capitalised) has been reserved for the translation of ‘un home’ which is explicitly used in the text to refer to a children’s institution. [4] It is unclear why ‘Belgian policemen’ has been used instead of ‘Belgian policeman’ (seeing that only one is mentioned in the text).

[6] Note on the usage of ‘peasant’: Although ‘paysan’ is often translated with a term synonymous to ‘farmer,’ ‘peasant’ has been used because ‘peasant’ is a more neutral word that implies anyone who lives in Belgium and, in terms of subsistence, relies mainly on the produce of his/her own labour [in other words, a rural labourer]. By contrast, a ‘farmer’ is usually someone who either owns or manages a farm and cultivates the land, which may or may not be the case with a peasant.

[14] Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond [Flemish National League]. The text has been left as written, i.e. ‘…avec un commissaire de police Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond [Flemish National League].,’ due to lack of clarity regarding the relationship between Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond [Flemish National League]. and the police. [15] Based on context, it is suspected that ‘sans que’ is a misspelling of ‘sens que.’ ']", they received comparatively well-cooked semolina soup, etc. Some of the prisoners received parcels from their relatives and friends. Parcels weighing 250 gr. to 25 kilos were permitted. Before being handed to the recipients, the contents of these parcels were checked by the Tschekniks together with the SS-Command. The recipients then received confirmation cards which each contained additional five hand-written words. All men and women under 65 who were capable of working were registered in the work offices and divided up into the most different branches of work. Anyone over 65 did not need to work. There were special barracks in which only men lived, and also some in which women with children lived. Married couples over 65 could live together in special living quarters, but not together in one room. There was always plenty of different kinds of work to do in Theresienstadt. There was the inner construction of the sleeping quarters, the creation of a good system of piping, making provision for a supply of fresh water for the Ghetto from outside Theresienstadt, construction and upgrading of the streets around Theresienstadt, and the construction of the tram line from Bauschowitz to Theresienstadt. All these projects involved the labour of many thousands of prisoners. It is worth mentioning at this point the large work-group called ‘Kameik’, which built a large shooting-range in the mountains of Leitmeritz for the army. Those prisoners who worked outside Theresienstadt had the big advantage of better portions of food. In addition they had the possibility of coming into contact with the population. This meant that these workers had been able to smuggle fruit, vegetables, tobacco items and other goods, that were unknown delicacies, and this smuggling was often quietly tolerated by the Tschetniks. These goods were then partly exchanged for others with their friends or relatives, and partly sold to them or simply given. With this smuggling, it often happened that everything went smoothly as far as the entrance to the camp, but then the SS appeared and undertook a close inspection. Anyone caught would have had to expect a lengthy spell in prison. In particularly serious cases, they were ordered to be taken into the small fortress. In the South Barracks, which were outside Theresienstadt, a large industry was started. Here was a big building for making Mica splitters, and a workshop for shoes and clothes. The prisoners worked in these barracks in three shifts. After their work and other matters were done, the prisoners could go to their overnight accommodation. Finishing time was 9:00 pm in the summer and 8:00 pm in the winter. Warnings were sounded in Theresienstadt whenever Allied planes approached. The occupants of their accommodation stayed where they were. The police then had to undertake special patrols to check that the black-out regulations were being observed. In the living quarters and in the barracks were hairdressing rooms and sick bays for the outpatient treatment of those who were not seriously ill. There were shower rooms in the Hohenelbe barracks and in Block D VI. There used to be spacious brewery in D VI. The shower rooms generally enjoyed great popularity, yet permission passes to use these shower rooms could only be given by the Block Elder. Theresienstadt was the show-camp of the Gestapo. Almost at 3-month intervals Theresienstadt was visited by international commissions, accompanied by high-ranking SS, Gestapo, and army officers. The prisoners were not allowed to speak with the members of these commissions. These commissions were always a bad portent of coming events for the prisoners. Consistently large deportations to Auschwitz-Birkenau followed a few days after such visits. In addition, every two or three months large transportations to Auschwitz regularly took place, and these would decimate the camp by 8,000 people on average each time. In the winter half-year of 1943-44 the most people ever lived in Theresienstadt. At this time there were around 85,000 people in this small town. The number of daily deaths rose to 350-400 at this time. The bodies to brought into the mortuary and after a brief ceremony were taken into the crematorium nearby. In the autumn months of 1944 there were larger deportations to Auschwitz. On 25 April 1944, when I left Theresienstadt, there were around 50,000 people there. When I returned at the beginning of February 1945, there were barely 10,000 still present there. In effect it seemed that Theresienstadt had almost died out. Between 1941 and 1944 around 120,000 people had been funnelled through Theresienstadt to Auschwitz. In the first days of April 1945 a convoys of 20 cars bearing the national emblem of Denmark appeared. The few Jews of Danish nationality were taken out of Theresienstadt in these cars. As these people were loaded into these cars, there were some comical scenes. The accompanying staff gave cigarettes to the prisoners who were looking on with interest. Senior Storm Leader (Obersturmführer) Rahm and Squad Leader (Scharführer) Heindl, who happened to be present, wanted to stop the Danes giving these out, but could not prevent this, as the Danes were steadfast. Rahm even tried to climb into one of these cars, but was prevented from doing so by the accompanying staff in a polite but energetic manner; he was told that such entry into Danish territory was forbidden to him. In that period of time it was also revealing that neither Heindl nor Rahm put right or struck any of the smoking Jews. Smoking was banned in Theresienstadt, with the threat of the most severe sanctions for anyone who was caught. The convoy of cars left Theresienstadt amidst the cheering of the prisoners who remained behind, and it did in fact reach the intended destination in Denmark despite the ongoing and unresolved war negotiations that were taking place. There were spaces constructed for religious services in the attics of the Hamburger and Genie barracks as well as in corresponding spaces in the C IV sleeping quarters, and these were used by practising Christians and Jews on an alternate basis. In Theresienstadt there were not only those of Jewish faith, but also baptised Jews of the Christian faith. It was through this that, for example, in the fire brigade I got to know and value a man called Tabaksblatt. He had been an evangelical missionary in Holland, and his father was a senior rabbi in Lodz. I also came to know a ‘designated Jew’ (‘Geltungsjude’) in Theresienstadt who had been an evangelical priest in a German town. On 11th November 1943 a count of all the people was made in the ‘Bauschowitzer Basin’, a valley between Theresienstadt and Bauschowitz. Only those who were confined to bed were allowed to stay in the town. From 6 o’clock in the morning the entire population of Theresienstadt – in groups arranged according to their accommodation blocks – moved to the roll call area. They marched there until around midday. The entire area was blocked off by order of the Tschetniks. The SS members now let off steam by hitting the prisoners. Old people and children were not spared. There was no chance of answering calls of nature. At around 9:00pm Senior Storm Leader (Obersturmführer) Burger, the camp leader, decided to allow the prisoners back into Theresienstadt. But now sad events played out. Old people who could no longer walk called to passers-by to support them, and children who had become lost called for their mothers. In addition people found themselves mixed up with others, with everyone looking to find their own, which was hardly possible in the darkness. It was long past midnight when the inmates managed to regain their sense of peace. Seeing the packed mass of people in this small space on the road from Theresienstadt to Bauschowitz, the passing Czech population had gained the impression that the Jews would be annihilated here through bombs dropped by planes. This view was also stated on 12 November 1943 in Theresienstadt. This was confirmed to us in reports by outside work groups and members of police patrols who has picked up on the very strong movement of bicycles, pedestrians and cars on the road from Theresienstadt to Bauschowitz. The sport and culture office had the nice task of offering a diversion for the prisoners. And so football and other ball-sport competitions were organised on the bastion. The bastion was a large area of lawn between the fortification walls behind the Jäger barracks. Opera and operetta events and concerts gave the many Jewish artists a wholesome nourishment, and the prisoners a beneficial diversion for a few hours…… from the thoughts that were constantly circling inside their heads about the Sword of Damocles of further deportations. These events even sometimes silenced the stomachs that were grumbling in hunger for a few hours. In March 1945 the children’s operetta ‘Brautschky’ (‘Little Glow Worm’) was performed, but this only involved the Czech children of prisoners who were three years or older. One of the main performers was a girl of barely four years of age. This operetta enthused both old and young and was performed around eight times. The members of the SS Command were present at one of the last performances. In their inner excitement these gentlemen did not smoke cigarettes during the entire performance, but they puffed at them instead. I was on fire brigade duty in Sokolowna and so I could see at close hand the constantly changing expressions on the faces of these criminals, and the way they were racked by their consciences. When they were looking at these charming little children, they probably must have been recalling how many such children had been deported to their deaths in Auschwitz. Apart from the constant hunger and the uncertainly about the imminent deportations to Auschwitz, the prisoners were also tormented by huge plagues of bugs and fleas. These tiny creatures were present in unimaginable numbers and could not be eradicated by the constant fumigations of the living quarters. Marriages were not possible in Theresienstadt. For example whenever two person became attached to each other, they could have the words ‘life companion’ written into their central ID cards as an appropriate term. If they so wished, a ritual wedding would take place, but one without any legal validity. Any consequential actions within the community of ‘life companions’ and also in interactions with legally married people were not allowed to be made apparent. Otherwise this would definitely result in deportations to Auschwitz. In July 1944 the film ‘Theresienstadt’ was made. The only prisoners to be filmed were those who had a certain Jewish appearance. The Jewish Elder was also to drive around in the town, and he received a cigar which was taken from him once the filming was over. In January 1945 the Command put together a transport of around 1000 people destined for Switzerland. Volunteers were also allowed to join this transport. Those taking part were dressed and equipped in their finest. The transport left Theresienstadt and arrived in Switzerland in modern train carriages. From the end of March 1945 transports of Jewish prisoners arrived almost daily from other camps, which had to be emptied as the Russian Army in the east was approaching. Some of these transports arrived in Theresienstadt on foot, others in cattle trucks. These poor people were completely exhausted and for the most part were accommodated in the hospitals. Those Jewish prisoners who had arrived in the trucks had to be literally unloaded as if they were freight. These people found that they had become unbelievably weakened. These returnees brought us the first news of the hitherto unknown conditions inside the Auschwitz extermination camp. Dr Schnurmacher, Dr Winternitz, Heinrich Jokel and Leo Kaufmann, my comrades in the first Ghetto Watch, all of whom were amongst the returnees, provided me with detailed and thorough descriptions of Auschwitz. I can clearly offer one example of the decimation of the Jewish people, and I take it from a specific transport to Theresienstadt from Berlin. This was Transport I/90, which was brought to Theresienstadt on 17 March 1943. This transport arrived with 1350 people in Theresienstadt on 18 March 1943. 49 of these people were still alive on 15 May 1945. In the days between 22 and 26 April 1945, a Commission of the Swiss Red Cross appeared in Theresienstadt in six cars. After briefly consulting with the SS Command, they declared the entire camp and the small fortress to be international territory. A Red Cross flag was raised on the church tower. The inmates of Theresienstadt were very excited, yet peace was maintained. After the Commission had arrived, the destruction of the records began. The fire brigade had to work for many days in day shifts and night shifts under the supervision of the SS and the police force. The liberation of the prisoners of Theresienstadt by Russian forces followed on 9 May 1945 at around 7:00 pm. A Russian major with his staff took over the leadership. Official closing time was set for 10:00 pm. Infringements did not occur. After a quarantine period lasting three weeks, the prisoners were officially discharged with repatriation ID documents. On 10 June 1945 I left Theresienstadt with my family and our friends Ernst Werner and his mother," as well as Erwin Diettrich. We travelled by train from Bauschowitz to Dresden. From there we walked to Berlin where we arrived in Berlin Marienfelde on 26 June 1945.

36,"[""Reactions on the boycott day in Berlin: the decision to emigrate and leave everything behind by well-to-do people; the hope of the discontented that the time for revenge was near. Mr and Mrs Beck left Mr and Mrs Beck's most comfortable flat to Mr and Mrs Beck's old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst. their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst's brother, a Nazi in uniform who would protest Her brother, a Nazi in uniform who would protest his lasting friendship for them's lasting friendship for Mr and Mrs Beck was trusted with the sale of the remaining valuables worth about RM 100 000 as stated in a contract; Mr and Mrs Beck never received a word or a penny from their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst, after Mr and Mrs Beck's departure. Although already 65 years of age, when their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst first came to London, their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst worked from 1933 until their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst's death in 1944 indefatigably and successfully, in spite of the handicaps which the economic difficulties of those years put in their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst's way again and again. their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst's wife, too, worked from His wife's arrival in this country, and that as a secretary and lady-clerk, until His wife's health broke down and His wife retired aged 74. Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old, recounts: When we were at Eibsee in Upper Bavaria in the winter of 1927, we used to see young people every once in a while with a swastika on young people's jacket. This displeased one man who was clearly a regular at Eibsee in Upper Bavaria; he placed himself before the entrance of the Schwemme, where they usually stopped, intercepted young people one by one and declared: 'Whoever wears such a badge does not come in here!' young people simply turned around, left the place and are said to have headed towards Badersee which is situated nearby. On 01 April 1933, Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old, had Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old,'s habitual meeting with Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old,'s married daughter at a hairdresser's in Wittenbergplaz in Charlottenburg. Along the way, Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old, saw the smashed in windows of the Kaufhaus des Westens and completely understood when Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old,'s daughter declared that her married daughter wanted to leave this country with her married daughter's family as soon as possible and, on no account, wanted to have her married daughter's child grow up in this poisoned atmosphere. her married daughter begged the mother to persuade the father to do the same. Once home, her married daughter spoke with her married daughter's husband and found that the father had already deliberated the problem thoroughly. the father said to her married daughter: 'When her married daughter have read the book, Mein Kampf, you know that you can no longer delude yourself.' their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst was a very rich man, owner of a considerable cardboard factory with 80 employees and accustomed to living in utmost luxury with their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst's family. The decision to leave everything behind and emigrate into the complete unknown could not have been easy for their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst, especially since their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst was then already 65 years old. It had always been their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst's principle to lend an ear to every reasonable request from their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst's employees, but, when someone had gone on strike once, they had to know that under no circumstances would they be hired again. The daughter of the first foreman (Liepe by name), who had also worked in a considerable cardboard factory with 80 employees, belonged to a trade union; The daughter of the first foreman (Liepe by name), who had also worked in the factory had taken part in a strike at the end of the '20s, and he had remained firm in his refusal to admit The daughter of the first foreman (Liepe by name), who had also worked in the factory again. Now, one day in the middle of April, the second foreman declared to Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old, that the second foreman considered it the second foreman's duty to let Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old, know that Foreman Liege had said to the second foreman: 'The first who will hang on the next tree is old Beck.' Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old, told Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old,'s husband nothing of this short but informative discussion, since the father was already negotiating the sale of a considerable cardboard factory with 80 employees. The prospects deteriorated, however, with increasing rapidity. The buyer who had at first agreed to pay ¼ million RM just for a considerable cardboard factory with 80 employees's goodwill ultimately received ¼ million RM just for the company's goodwill for the current price of the machines and inventory; The buyer who had at first agreed to pay ¼ million RM just for the company's goodwill accepted, though, the provided conditions: (1) that the employees would not be dismissed and (2) that The buyer who had at first agreed to pay ¼ million RM just for the company's goodwill would pay the current price of the machines and inventory in cash, which was crucial under the threatening circumstances. Admittedly, ¼ million RM just for the company's goodwill then soon went missing in other ways. At that time, Mr and Mrs Beck were living at Innsbrucker Strasse 14 - that is, opposite the Café Meran, a central meeting place for the Nazis. A giant swastika flag hung on the frontage of the Café Meran, a central meeting place for the Nazis and constituted an incessantly irritating strain on Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old,'s nerves, but when at last the big lifts, which were to take Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old,'s belongings to this country, then stood on the street, Mr and Mrs Beck were not affected.[1] The household staff as well as the people in a considerable cardboard factory with 80 employees, apart from the one exception, also remained loyal to the end. Customs clearance was at the Anhalter Bahnhof. Mr and Mrs Beck's numerous suitcases were not searched - unopened, just marked with chalk. Mr and Mrs Beck had left Mr and Mrs Beck's apartment to an old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst. an old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst wanted to know whether an old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst had to give their apartment back if Mr and Mrs Beck did not like life abroad. The reply: 'However Mr and Mrs Beck shall be, never are Mr and Mrs Beck coming back to this country again.' an old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst's brother, who at the time was wearing the SA uniform, used to still assure an old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst even then of Ida Wüst's brother, who at the time was wearing the SA uniform's sincere friendship. Ida Wüst's brother, who at the time was wearing the SA uniform was an auctioneer, and it seemed natural to entrust Ida Wüst's brother, who at the time was wearing the SA uniform with the sale of a number of assets which had to be left behind. Ida Wüst's brother, who at the time was wearing the SA uniform felt certain that Ida Wüst's brother, who at the time was wearing the SA uniform would obtain the best prices. It concerned a valuable Blüthner piano, a large car and a yacht, together with a sales value of 100'000 RM. their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst made a contract at their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst's lawyer's with an old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst in which their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst left their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst the objects for sale with the guarantee of a corresponding commission. their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst never saw anything of the money and only learnt that his lawyer's had left this country in connection with the emigrations. Trying to get something back by way of compensation proved to be unfeasible. In this country, their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst visited the companies from which their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst had obtained the cardboard for their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst's factory. the companies from which he had obtained the cardboard for his factory entrusted their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst with the companies from which he had obtained the cardboard for his factory's representation, and, from 1933 to 1939, their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst worked for the companies from which he had obtained the cardboard for his factory with the greatest success and sold the companies from which he had obtained the cardboard for his factory's products to wholesalers and factories in Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Belgium. The outbreak of the war put an end to this work. their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst now began to build trade relations in Canada and, by doing so, soon established a new field of work for their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst. Then came the requisition of cardboard by the government in connection with wartime economic measures, which no longer left much freedom of movement for a job capable of supporting a by then over 70-year-old man. Based on a newspaper advertisement, their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst nevertheless secured work as the representative of a company in the provinces producing lining silk for leather bags and had hardly settled in when the lining of leather bags was forbidden. their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst travelled to the factory in London and suggested offering lining silk in future as coat lining for which lining silk's good quality wholly justified lining silk's use. their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst operated sales successfully even on this basis with again entirely new clients and was hindered only by the need to observe the extent to which the material could be made available. their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst died in 1944. Through all these years, their old friend, the well-known actress Ida Wüst's wife had been the secretary, bookkeeper and maid of all work in the small companies. Even now, 64 years old, His wife still could and would not go into retirement. His wife obtained an appointment as secretary and bookkeeper in a company, where His wife remained four years. Even later, into His wife's 74th year, His wife was working and letting rooms at the same time; then ill health forced His wife to retire. [1] Although the personal pronoun 'they' in the text most logically refers to Emigrants Frau BECK, now 80 years old,'s nerves, the overall meaning of the sentence remains slightly unclear.

37,"['The author tells the story of a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin until a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin was denounced, arrested, and deported to Auschwitz. When in 1944 the Russian Army was approaching a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin and other prisoners were taken away in a goods train. During a halt a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin escaped and, with the help of a German soldier and an old woman made a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin's way to Berlin. After a doctor had removed the Auschwitz number with which a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin had been branded, a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin found employment in a military clothing depot in Stassfurt. Escape From a Concentration Camp Transport With the Help of a German Soldier In autumn or winter 1944, I visited old friends – Mr Alfred Nomis, his wife and 12-year-old daughter (he was Jewish, his wife was a Christian) – at Schivelbeinerstr. 31, N.[1], Berlin. He worked as a furrier, and after initially being made to do forced labour somewhere, he was released and made to do furrier work for the military in his little flat. He had to supply a certain amount of fur waistcoats, etc. every day. a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin worked for him. When the Jews were being deported in Berlin, a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin did not return home to a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin's flat at night because a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin was scared. a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin stayed somewhere at night and worked at my friend’s place during the day, as a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin was destitute and needed to earn money. One day, despite all warnings, a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin decided to go to the birthday party of a Christian friend who had let a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin store a few things at a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin's place. a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin's friend’s aunty was also at the birthday party of a Christian friend who had let her store a few things at her place. Her friend’s aunty had nothing better to do than to notify the police. a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin was immediately arrested and deported to Auschwitz. That was the last we heard of a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin. When I visited in 1944, my friends asked if I wanted to see an old acquaintance again. my friends opened a room that had been locked, and in the bed lay the aforementioned girl with the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off's hair cut off. the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off looked emaciated, you could see the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off's bones. Once I reassured the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off again and again that I would not betray the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off, the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off told me her story: In autumn 1944, prisoners of Auschwitz were transported to other camps because the Russians were advancing. the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off spent two days and a night in a goods wagon with no food. One evening, the train stopped at a small station and the poor people were allowed to relieve the poor people. the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off plucked up the courage to go around the small building in the darkness and climb into the brakeman’s cabin of a freight wagon waiting at the opposite platform, of course without knowing where the train was going. Once the train had set off, a soldier climbed the steps up to the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off. a soldier had watched the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off, and asked the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off what was the meaning of all of this. a soldier told the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off was in a train heading for the front, but the train would stop at the next station and the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off would need to vanish there, no matter what. After the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off told a soldier the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off's story, a soldier told the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off a soldier wanted to help. a soldier was born in Switzerland, married a German and took German citizenship for a soldier's wife’s sake, so a soldier was forced to go to war. a soldier gave the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off's money and a handkerchief so that the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off could wash under the nearby fountain. a soldier agreed to meet the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off in the station bar, which was open until 11. a soldier said a soldier would come and get the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off there and find the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off somewhere to stay. Where? Not even a soldier knew yet. a soldier said the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off was not to stay on the street under any circumstances – the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off would be immediately - 2 - arrested there. the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off followed all of a soldier's orders. The Red Cross were set up in a small station. The Red Cross gave the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off's hot food, and the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off waited here for the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off's saviour. a soldier needed to slip away without permission. a soldier met the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off and told the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off had to tell everybody the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off was a refugee on the way to the West. the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off had lost the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off's baggage and could no longer find the group of refugees the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off had been with up until this point. a soldier walked with the aforementioned girl with her hair cut off along the streets of a small station and knocked at a small house, where a shimmer of light could be seen. An old woman opened a freight wagon waiting at the opposite platform. a soldier told a soldier's made-up story again, and An old woman took a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin in. a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin could sleep in a bed for the first time again. At 5am, somebody banged loudly on the front door. The little town had to be evacuated within 2 hours because the front was approaching. All residents had to make All residents's way to the train station. An old woman gave a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin a coat and An old woman carried the baggage. Both women travelled to Frankfurt an der Oder, where An old woman went to stay with relatives. a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin bought a ticket to Berlin and headed to my friends’ place late in the evening. Once a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin had started to recover, they wondered what to do with a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin. a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin could not stay in a Jewish person’s flat, especially as a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin had her Auschwitz identification number emblazoned on a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin's arm. They found a doctor who removed her Auschwitz identification number emblazoned on her arm. a doctor who removed the tattoo handed a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin her Auschwitz identification number emblazoned on her arm in a glass filled with alcohol and said: “Keep her Auschwitz identification number emblazoned on her arm in a safe place, a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin may still need her Auschwitz identification number emblazoned on her arm.” Then my friends contacted a good friend, who was a Feldwebel (sergeant) in a military uniform store in Stassfurt. my friends told a good friend, who was a Feldwebel (sergeant) in a military uniform store in Staßfurt about the young woman who a good friend, who was a Feldwebel (sergeant) in a military uniform store in Staßfurt used to know. After a few days, a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin travelled to Stassfurt with a new identity card to work in the uniform store in Stassfurt until the end of the war, when a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin ran into the arms of the first Americans to arrive. a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin went to Sweden to rest, then emigrated to America, where a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin is happily married. I have saved myself the trouble of reporting on a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin's experiences in Auschwitz. The things that happened there are well known. I can get a young Jewish girl who, at the beginning of the war, worked secretly for a Jewish furrier in Berlin's name and address through my friends, who now live in Buenos Aires. Mrs Hedwig Peiser, née Harms Berlin, N.W.6, 143, West End Lane. 30/10/1956 See letter to Mrs Peiser[2] [1] It is assumed that “Berlin N.” refers to a district of Berlin.

38,"['Detailed report on organisation and conditions in Theresienstadt by a member of the Jewish Ghetto Guard Willy Goerner. The first ghetto guard was dissolved in June 1943 and most of The first ghetto guard's members perished in Auschwitz. After that, only men over ?? were employed in The first ghetto guard. In April 1944 a member of the Jewish Ghetto Guard Willy Goerner was transferred to the Aussenarbeitsgruppe Wulkow, a working party of over 200 inmates of Theresienstadt, who had to construct a future emergency HQ for the Berlin Gestapo in the woods. a member of the Jewish Ghetto Guard Willy Goerner was put in charge of the camp but, because of a member of the Jewish Ghetto Guard Willy Goerner's lenient treatment of the inmates, a member of the Jewish Ghetto Guard Willy Goerner was replaced by another Jew, Rafaelsohn, who ill-treated the inmates (and was executed in Prague 1947). a member of the Jewish Ghetto Guard Willy Goerner was sent to a different working party, the “Z-Baustelle,” which prepared a future HQ for Hitler. The prisoners employed there were guarded by police men from Berlin who behaved decently. The working groups were sent back to Theresienstadt in February 1945. a member of the Jewish Ghetto Guard Willy Goerner gives instances of sadism existed by Obersturmfuehrer Stuczka, but also mentions that SS-Oberscharfuehrer Hanke treated The prisoners employed there more decently. a member of the Jewish Ghetto Guard Willy Goerner gives also dates of transports from Berlin to Theresienstadt and from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz. Every two to three months about 8,000 people were sent to Auschwitz. a member of the Jewish Ghetto Guard Willy Goerner estimates the total between 1941 and 1944 at 120,000. 9.

Theresienstadt Concentration Camp - Ghetto The position of the Camp Theresienstadt, which was a fortress until 1882, is situated in the Bohemian area of Leitmeritz, where the Eger and Elbe rivers converge, some 50 kilometres north of Prague. Theresienstadt had around 7,000 inhabitants until 1941. The area of a fortress encompasses around 500,000 square meters. The barracks and living blocks were built in square formations, as the plan shows. The old houses of Theresienstadt are only one floor high; in contrast the new houses are two to three floors high. The Czech inhabitants of Theresienstadt had already been evacuated to the interior of the country on the orders of the Berlin Gestapo in the autumn of 1941. The moveable inventory in The old houses of the town as well as portable ovens and stoves were cleared out at the same time. So only empty rooms remained. Organisation of the Camp Theresienstadt, which was a fortress until 1882 The SS Camp Leadership The official rooms of the SS Command were in the street Q 4 /14 and 16. The living quarters of the Commanders and the other administrative officials were in the street L 3/24 Names of the Commanders: 1941/43 SS Commander Dr Seidel Senior teacher from Vienna 1943/44 SS Commander Burger Manufacturer from Vienna 1944/45 SS Commander Rahm Metal worker from Vienna SS Commander Bergel Permanent representative of the camp commander, manufacturer from Vienna The most well-known and most-feared other SS member there is: SS Lieutenant Heindl, a procurer from Vienna, who was well known to some Jewish fellow-sufferers from Vienna. The Jewish Self-Administration The Jewish Self-Administration comprised a Council of Elders with a Jewish Elder. The heads of the individual branches of The Jewish Self-Administration belonged to a Council of Elders. The SS Commander at any given time appointed a Jewish Elder. a Jewish Elder could a Jewish Elder choose a Jewish Elder's closest colleagues and had to present the list of his closest colleagues to The SS Commander for approval. a Jewish Elder held the position like a mayor of a German town, with the same departments and appropriate offices. So there were the following in Theresienstadt: Central administration with card files Finance administration with a banking institution Commercial office with a central administration for goods Food department with kitchen administration Work department Culture and sports office Health office with corresponding hospital administration Building office Police station with economic, criminal and street Police The following Jewish elders held office from 1941 until 1945: 1941/43 Jakob Edelstein 1943/44 Dr Eppstein 1944/45 Dr Murmelstein All the departments needed for The Jewish Self-Administration were based in the Magdeburg barracks. In the same house more comfortable quarters were made available for a Jewish Elder and for those running the various departments. In the Fortification A IV there was the bakery with eight ovens in which bread for the inmates was baked by inmates. Bread rolls, etc. were also baked for the Berlin Gestapo in the bakery with eight ovens in which bread for the inmates was baked by inmates. Matzah for the Passover Festival was also baked in the bakery with eight ovens in which bread for the inmates was baked by inmates, under the supervision of Rabbis. But Matzah for the Passover Festival was only distributed to those who were strictly observant, because there was so little available. The central storage area was also in the Fortification A IV. The central storage area is where there were very large supplies of all possible items, from the smallest shoe nails, nail files, paint and coatings, brushes and brooms, etc. as well as the most expensive medications and surgical items. Even on the day when Theresienstadt was liberated, there were still supplies of food, etc. for another six months or so. From 1942 the Head of Police was Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines. Through Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines's energetic interventions with the Commandants, Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines had been able to implement improvements for those living in Theresienstadt. On 17th May 1942 Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines created a Ghetto Watch as the street police for Theresienstadt. a Ghetto Watch was based in Barracks L 3/13 and comprised three Watch Groups totalling 150 police. Jews taken on to the role of a Ghetto Watch men were former soldiers and could not be younger than 22 or older than 35 years old. The privilege of being taken on as a member of a Ghetto Watch was given to members of the A. K. Transports. So a Ghetto Watch initially comprised only Czech Jews. The first Ghetto Watch had the privilege of being able to protect The first Ghetto Watch's family members in each transport. the privilege of being able to protect their family members in each transport was taken away by the Commandants in June 1943. At first there no uniforms. The police officers wore caps similar to those of the French Army, made from black material with a protective flap and a narrow yellow stripe on the upper edges. Above a protective flap were insignia denoting rank on small metal badges with the letters G.W. The Watch Group leaders had two wide, yellow, vertical stripes fixed above the flaps of caps similar to those of the French Army, made from black material with a protective flap and a narrow yellow stripe on the upper edges, whereas the train leaders had just the one stripe. The Corporal leaders wore two narrow yellow stripes, and The Corporal leaders's deputies just the one. Each police officer wore a number on the left side of Each police officer's suit while performing duties. White linen belts were worn around their waist over their civilian jackets, while train and group leaders also wore white straps. With the exception of the ranked officers every G.W. man carried a wooden truncheon, whereas the German Police carried rubber truncheons. In addition to the regular squad of 350 men, 1,100 young and inexperienced Jews aged between 21 and 30 were trained in courses lasting eight weeks to become additional police reserves. The person who ran courses lasting eight weeks to become additional police reserves was the Austrian General Staff Captain Reich Weichsel, who was assisted by former non-commissioned officer Schüler and Sergeant Willy Görner as instructors. In May 1943 the G.W. was supplied with a grey uniform, manufactured from dyed linen material. On 17 May 1943 the first anniversary of G.W.’s time was ceremoniously marked in the area of the Dresden Barrack. The formal swearing-in of 350 men and of the reservists took place at 10:00 am. The formal swearing-in of the G.W. men and of the reservists was followed by a march-past by the G.W. in group formation in front of the Council of Elders. Those watching were unguarded Czechs, some SS men in civilian clothes, and a large number of inmates. The subsequent march-past of the G.W. in goose-step had left such an impression that the uniforms had to be handed over as early as the afternoon of 17th May 1943. The order by the Commandants to dissolve the G.W. with immediate effect was given on 1 June 1943 and a new G.W. comprising only men over 45 years old was put into place. Those who were higher-ranked remained with the Police. In the late summer of 1943 those G.W. men whose services were dispensed with were deported to Auschwitz together with those G.W. men whose services were dispensed with's relatives. the Council of Elders stated that those G.W. men whose services were dispensed with would be Watch men again in Auschwitz. I do not know that more than eight persons of the first G.W. survived. Even the second-rate G.W. men were all taken to Auschwitz in the autumn of 1944, because Even the second-rate G.W. men were involved in smuggling with outside groups and illegal exchange of letters which had involved the Czechs and the outside groups. Some of the Czechs who were involved were punished and transferred to the Dresden Barrack. The police had the task of keeping order in the streets and above all in ensuring that there was no paper in the streets and that the prisoners did not spit onto the ground. The illegal task meant one had to be really careful when the S.S. came into Theresienstadt, and to report this immediately to the O.D. (security staff) and inform the house and the room Elder. The police, dealing with criminal and business matters, was under Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines as well. The crime police had the same tasks to perform as the Berlin crime police. The business police carried out checks in the kitchen and the business camps. The security staff (called O.D: i.e. Ordnungsdienst) was part of the Police. The security staff (called O.D: i.e. Ordnungsdienst) was under the central administration. Only men above 45 were used as security staff, as Only men above 45 would have to do light work. Only men above 45 had to ensure that peace and order were maintained in the living blocks and the barracks. When working at night, Only men above 45 had to check that only those who could show written proof of permission to go to work could leave only those who could show written proof of permission to go to work's accommodation. There was a large hospital in the High Elbe (Hohenelbe) Barracks equipped with a modern operating room. The lives of many prisoners were saved here by the most capable of Jewish doctors. Beyond this in the barracks was a large shower room with baths, which could be used by the prisoners. In the Gnie Barracks there was a TB hospital and areas for the special treatment of eye, ear etc. illnesses. The very best doctors were to be found working here. In Fortification H.II there was a construction yard. Car repairs were carried out here. A special carpentry department had to produce the finest items of furniture for the Commandants. Toy and ink production was also based in H.II, both intended for German customers. The proceeds of this work were credited to the procuring funds of the Commandants. In L 5/21 and 24 (the former riding stables) was the big machine carpentry department, which constructed parts of barracks for the German army, as ordered by the SS Command. In the autumn of 1943 a big machine was also introduced for the manufacture of clogs and shoes for the prisoners. The Sudeten Barracks housed around 10,000 prisoners until the summer of 1943. The Sudeten Barracks were cleared out and then the entire European personnel file indexes were placed here. Only German police officials under the supervision of the Berlin Gestapo worked here. the entire European personnel file indexes were burned by the fire brigade in the first half of April 1945 on the orders of the Berlin Gestapo and under the supervision of the Berlin Gestapo and the Czechs in work that took days and nights to complete. The Aussiger Barracks was the depository for clothes. Prisoners in each incoming transport were registered in The Aussiger Barracks and liberated from Prisoners in each incoming transport's most valuable possessions in terms of clothes, etc. Every now and then these items were particularly sought, and taken to the country by the truckload. The Bodenbach Barracks with The Bodenbach Barracks with its armoury's armoury was the home for Jews until the autumn of 1943. After The Bodenbach Barracks with its armoury was emptied, the officials who had worked in The Sudeten Barracks were accommodated there. Block D II – Kasino – was where the Czech police force was quartered. The police officers were called ‘Tschetniks’ for short. The police officers were brought in to guard Theresienstadt and The police officers were stationed at posts by the exits of the Dresden Barrack and by the ramparts. The Czech Jews would talk and exchange news in a lively way, sometimes with old acquaintances and at other times with other trustworthy Czechs. Cigarettes as well as other tobacco goods and also money were brought to Theresienstadt through posts by the exits of the fortress and by the ramparts. The police officers brought in large amounts of money for Jews that The police officers had befriended. The police officers's commission was anything up to 50% of the money The police officers brought in. But overall The police officers behaved decently towards the Jews. There were some amongst The police officers who were guilty of violently hitting prisoners. Of particular note in this connection was Janischeck, the Commandant of The police officers. In recognition of Janischeck, the Commandant of the Tschechniks's poor treatment of both prisoners and also Janischeck, the Commandant of the Tschechniks's own police officers, Janischeck, the Commandant of the Tschechniks was awarded the epaulettes of a German captain. The police officers also had the task of leading and looking after those work groups who were deployed outside Theresienstadt. The fire brigade was accommodated in L 5/2. The fire brigade's leader was the Jewish fire engineer Leo Holzer from Vienna. The fire brigade consisted of three groups keeping watch, comprising 50 men, who were initially trained by the Jewish fire engineer Leo Holzer from Vienna. A fire engine of the oldest type, with a motorised spray and a lot of hoses and a mechanical ladder was the extent of the technical equipment. The entire crew of The fire brigade was deported to Auschwitz in March 1944. the Jewish fire engineer Leo Holzer from Vienna, was removed from the group of deportees, because the SS Command didn’t want to be left without a single fireman. None of the group of deportees came back. The frequent fires in the ash bunkers and chimneys meant that The fire brigade had enough calls into action. There were also bigger fires. In February 1945 a shoe-making barracks in the area of The Sudeten Barracks went up in flames. As a result Jakob Edelstein was struck so hard by an SS officer that two of Jakob Edelstein's back teeth were knocked out, because in the opinion of an SS officer The fire brigade had not showed up quick enough at the scene. In March 1945 an area of approximately 600 square metres burned where a roof of The Sudeten Barracks was being constructed. In this instance The fire brigade had offered to come but were not required. The speedy and courageous fight against this large fire had resulted in the praiseworthy recognition of the Jewish fire engineer Leo Holzer from Vienna, in the form of a small container of liver sausage and 100 grammes of margarine. The fire brigade fought The fire brigade's last big fire at 5:00 am on 9 May 1945. In The Sudeten Barracks the area for uniform materials had gone up in flames. It was around midday when an SS officer came to the site of their last big fire, tapped Jakob Edelstein in a jovial way on Jakob Edelstein's shoulder, saying: “Well, Jakob Edelstein, The fire brigade won’t be reconstructing The Sudeten Barracks anymore.” the Jewish fire engineer Leo Holzer from Vienna lingered for a short while at the site of their last big fire, and then returned to the Commandants’ area. It was later that said by a Tschetnik that their last big fire was started by Squad Leader Heindl. A large number of the camp prisoners were alerted to their last big fire by the noise of The fire brigade, and in curiosity A large number of the camp prisoners came to the southern gate to watch the work of their last big fire being extinguished. At this time the rest of the German army left Theresienstadt to go in a north-western direction. It was during the previous night, from 8 to 9 May 1945, that the bulk of the German army had moved out, so the Tschechniks had told us. The agricultural team were based in D I, and The agricultural team managed several hundred acres of land together with a haulage area and a lot of agricultural equipment. In addition there was the entire livestock that had come from the area of Lidice, taken by the Berlin Gestapo. The leader of the agriculture section was the Czech Cursavy, a member of the French Army. There were only a few occasions when the Czech Cursavy, a member of the Nazi Party hit the Czech Cursavy, a member of the Nazi Party's Jewish workers, and only then when the Berlin Gestapo made the Czech Cursavy, a member of the Nazi Party do this. Blocks E Iva and E IVb were intended for the accommodation of children. Only Czech children were in E IVb. There was another children’s home in L 4/19. The church that was situated between these two blocks stayed closed the whole time. In the corner-house L 4/9 4/15 there was a shop for ladies’ and gents’ ready-made clothes. With ladies’ and gents’ ready-made clothes's coupons the inmates could acquire clothing which the inmates now needed, but only after receiving the prior permission of the business office. The stocks were replenished by the items left by prisoners who had died or had been deported. On the plot of land there was a coffee house in the Viennese style. Every visitor received a cup of coffee (no coffee beans) and a lump of sugar for the payment of two Ghetto-Kronen. The famous composer Translatär played the piano in a coffee house in the Viennese style until The famous composer Translatär starved to death. In the autumn of 1943 and the spring of 1944 the market place of Theresienstadt was completely dug up and converted into a lawn area complete with large borders of flowers. There were even benches placed on the edges of the square. A music pavilion was built in the corner L4/Q4 opposite a coffee house in the Viennese style, as the high point of the publicity for those from the outside. A band played here every lunch time and evening. The pieces of music to be played were prescribed by the SS Command. Concerts and plays were performed in the Sokolowna (formerly the Sokol Club-house), situated on the street which runs south-west between Jäger- and Sudeten barracks. There was also a small theatre area, built by the inmates, on the floor of the Magdeburger barracks. Concerts and plays were performed by the many artists Jewish artists who found themselves in Theresienstadt, but only after receiving permission from the SS Command. In L 4/16 and 18 there was a watch repair workshop and a shop for spectacles. a watch repair workshop mainly carried out tasks for the SS Command. Only the heads of the main administration and the police received repair permission documents through the business office; in the case of spectacles receipts were handed out and repairs were carried out with the express permission of the business office. The butcher-shop was in area L 4/13. The butcher-shop supplied horse meat for the big kitchens. In general this butcher-shop, situated on the street, was empty. It was only on the days when commissions arrived in Theresienstadt for the purposes of inspecting that good meat and sausage products were displayed. A grocery shop was established in the house on L 4/11. Here one could buy a great choice of herbal teas, mustard and tomato puree with a coupon and in exchange for Ghetto-Kronen. This occurred on average at 3-monthly intervals for the inmates. Mustard and tomato puree were very popular as spreads for bread. The bank which supplied the Ghetto-Kronen money had The bank which supplied the Ghetto money's rooms on the ground floor of Q 4/14. Altogether around 5 million Ghetto Kronen notes were printed, made up of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 Kronen notes. This money was handed out as payment for work undertaken, and was the official currency of Theresienstadt. The possession of other forms of money was forbidden. The laundry was sited on the street which leads via square C to the small fortress. The laundry had been set up by the Jews and was operating in three shifts. Each prisoner received on average one washing permission document every three months, which allowed him/her to use the facilities to wash 3 kgs of clothes. The columbarium was on the left side of the L2 street which runs through the map squares II and III. The columbarium was the place where the deceased were remembered and where their ashes were stored. On the other side of the street opposite The columbarium was the mortuary, with The columbarium's small space where funeral ceremonies could take place in all solemnity. The deceased were placed in simple boxes comprising lengths of bare wood and carried in the chapel. Following a short funeral ceremony the boxes containing the deceased were loaded onto a carriage pulled by two horses, to be driven to the mortuary, with its small space where funeral ceremonies could take place in all solemnity. Those who were left behind were allowed to follow a carriage pulled by two horses as far as the exit of The columbarium. In the months September to May 1943 many thousands of urns (cardboard cartons) containing the ashes of those who had died up to May 1943 were transported to the Eger on the orders of the SS Command and under the supervision of the Berlin Gestapo and then this work into the river. Even children under 14 were called upon to do this work. The homes for the sick and infirm were in the block D VI and F III. All the very sick prisoners who were not expected to live were housed here. Many of the extremely sick prisoners owe Many of the extremely sick prisoners's lives to skills of the predominantly Jewish doctors present in Theresienstadt, if Many of the extremely sick prisoners were not to eventually die in Auschwitz. The Small Fortress The Small Fortress was a precursor to the fortress of Theresienstadt and was situated one kilometre north-east of Theresienstadt. Jews who had been severely punished in Theresienstadt by the SS Command were brought here. Czechs and Tschetniks as well as Germans who were guilty of collaborating with the Jews were likewise brought here. The Small Fortress was the nearest extermination camp to Theresienstadt. Only a small number of prisoners were able to survive this hell. Those prisoners who were guilty of further punishable offences were selected for shooting practice on the shooting range. Those prisoners who were guilty of further punishable offences were used as targets for shooting on the shooting range. As Hans Wagner, a fellow-sufferer in The Small Fortress, told me, the commandant ‘Pinja’ and the commandant ‘Pinja's daughter had taken part in shooting on the shooting range with great pleasure – and even the commandant ‘Pinja's daughter had distinguished his daughter in this. The Wulkow Outside Work Group In the first days of March 1944 a work-group comprising 235 men were sent to Wulkow in the region of Trebnitz, some 55 kms from Berlin, in order to build barracks. a work-group comprising 235 men were mainly volunteers. 235 men were This promise by the Council of Elders that 235 men and 235 men's families would be exempt from any transportation. This promise was kept. The Jewish lead worker was the Czech engineer Cosinier, and The Jewish lead worker had with The Jewish lead worker other engineers Schindler, Eckstein, Wassermann, Mukden and others. The the Berlin Gestapo leadership and supervising officers were: SS Senior Sergeant Franz Stuczka, clothing manufacturer from Vienna SS Senior Sergeant Czasny, cab driver from Vienna SS Senior Sergeant Hanke, bricklayer foreman from Vienna SS Senior Sergeant Proschek, bank messenger from Vienna In addition there was an SS Guards Group comprising ten SS-men with Lance-Corporal Schmidt as commander. The specialist work-force had a roofer, a well-digger, and experts in electricity, telephone, plumbing, and painting. ten SS-men with Lance-Corporal Schmidt as commander were not on the building site the whole day, but ten SS-men with Lance-Corporal Schmidt as commander's role was to give instructions regarding the individual tasks. ten SS-men with Lance-Corporal Schmidt as commander were all German. In the summer of 1944, ten SS-men with Lance-Corporal Schmidt as commander were joined by 25 women from Theresienstadt, whose job it was to keep the barracks in a good state of order as well as to clean the clothes of ten SS-men with Lance-Corporal Schmidt as commander. The specialist work-force was involved with 110 building projects in the woods on Wulkow. 110 building projects in the woods on Wulkow comprised building living barracks, work and kitchen barracks, as well as bunkers for files, pools of water for extinguishing fires, vehicle workshops, and a bunker for coal. Complete systems for sewage and wells with modern automatic pumps were created for Theresienstadt. the Camp Theresienstadt, which was a fortress until 1882 was the alternative place for the headquarters of the Berlin Gestapo, and was partly adopted for this purpose in the autumn of 1944, and was carefully watched over by a group of SS guards. In the first days of August 1944 a new building site was started, at a distance of around 2 kms from the Camp Theresienstadt, which was a fortress until 1882. a new building site was named the Z-building site. a new building site was built as the private chancellery of Hitler. a new building site consisted of living, working and kitchen barracks; a bunker for files was part of this, as was a pool of water for extinguishing fires, a vehicle workshop, and a shed for coal. The construction of a bunker for receiving news, made entirely from concrete, was also started. A modern system including piping, intended for extracting water, was likewise part of this. The hours of work for The working groups were 6:00 am to 10:00 pm in the summer months, and 7:00 am to dusk in the winter months. There was a one-hour midday break. Every second Sunday was given as a work-free day. In this connection, Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines had thought of special forms of amusement, at least for the mornings. Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines then often played a game of so-called ‘Häufchenmachen’ (‘piling up’). All members of The working groups had to come for a roll-call, and then, for reasons that were impossible to establish, Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines would select the most varied persons, and make the most varied persons come together in small piles. And then the group leaders were asked by the senior lieutenant about the group leaders's diligence, mental attitude, etc. Sometimes Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines left, having issued an order that no-one was to leave the group leaders's place. After one or two hours Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines either returned to continue the game, or broke the game up. A particular sport of Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines on the free Sundays was for the men to carry tree trunks from one place in the camp to another. For the women, ‘dragging stones’ was the order of the day. On one day in October, Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines managed a quite special orgy. In the previous days there had been a lot of rain, which had very much softened up the ground and created a large puddle in front of the living-barracks. Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines summoned a roll-call on this Sunday. Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines selected Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines's special favourites from amongst the women, and ordered the women to sit down on the ground, and to use the women's behinds to push the resulting mud to a place indicated by Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines. So the women had to lift up the women's clothes high so that the women were in effect clothed only in the women's knickers. In similar fashion, the women had to remove the women's upper clothes, leaving just the women's shirts and stand by to watch the women. The two women by the name of Schlesinger and Thomas had to bathe in the puddle, firstly immersing the front sides of The two women by the name of Schlesinger and Thomas's bodies fully into the puddle, and then the back sides. Then Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines trod on The two women by the name of Schlesinger and Thomas's upper bodies, then The two women by the name of Schlesinger and Thomas's lower bodies, so that their upper bodies were then completely covered in mud. And each time these procedures were accompanied by Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines laughing in a devilish way. After five hours The formal swearing-in of the G.W. men and of the reservists ended and this Sunday had been ruined. Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines was very unpopular amongst Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines's subordinates. Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines was also extraordinarily untrusting. With even the slightest suspicion of a perhaps unintended instance of untruthfulness on the part of the workmen Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines would react immediately with the cruellest methods of beating. the Commandants were likewise no angels. I can however maintain that the Commandants were very restrained in the matter of beating the workmen. Senior SS squad leader Hanke very often even acted in contradiction to the orders of the Senior Assault Leader, by caring well for those workers who had been beaten by Dr Karl Löwenstein, a former lieutenant commander in the German marines and placed in close detention. The Z-building-site work groups were led and watched by four SS men in the first week. On 1 October 1944 the supervision of The Z-building-site work groups and the guarding of the building-site were taken over by a group of police from Berlin comprising twelve policemen with a main guarding officer, even during the nights. The Z-building-site work groups lived in the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

39, even during the nights. Theresienstadt cared for the food requirements of The Z-building-site work groups. Every fourteen days a carriage of food would come from Theresienstadt. The rations were 10% more than in Theresienstadt Theresienstadt. The rations were very frequently significantly reduced by the senior squad leader for some or other reasons that were not transparent and were often completely non-existent. Then it was the young pods of the acacia trees that made up the meagre nourishment for The Z-building-site work groups.

40,"[""A record of an interview with a gypsy from Burgenland. The report illustrates the similarity between the treatment of Jews and that of gypsies. Racial persecution of the gypsies of Burgenland started soon after the annexation of Austria. To escape persecution, Mr Hodosi, like many others, volunteered for army service, but was expelled because of Mr Hodosi's race in spite of Goering's consent to an exception being made in Mr Hodosi's case. Mr Hodosi and Mr Hodosi's wife were arrested by the Gestapo in 1941 and brought to the Lackenbach camp in Burgenland. He and his wife escaped, but after a period of “illegal life” Mr Hodosi was arrested again and, together with Mr Hodosi's wife and 2 children, brought to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Mr Hodosi's description of conditions there corresponds with the many Jewish accounts of the subject. Mr Hodosi's children were starved to death. Mr Hodosi states that in the year particularly dark-skinned gypsies were selected for experiments on human beings at Bergen-Belsen. Towards the end of the year a number of young men and women volunteered for sterilization experiments, however the promise that a number of young men and women would be released afterwards was not kept. Mr Hodosi was allocated to the so-called “Bewährungstruppe” (Probationary Unit) which was forced to fight against the Russians in the Kottbus sector and suffered extremely high losses. Most of those who were not killed in action were murdered by the Gestapo. Mr Hodosi was lucky enough to be made a prisoner of war by the Russians. 8. Further References : Schreiner, the Gestapo official, Vienna. “.... Jews and Gypsies” What is written down here was experienced by Mr Hodosi.: It was the hardest time of Mr Hodosi's life. It’s hard for Mr Hodosi to remember, Mr Hodosi would like to forget… Mr Hodosi's home is in Burgenland. After the annexation of Austria we heard different things about the Nazis’ racial persecution. A lot of people believed A lot of people could escape this fate by registering voluntarily for the German army. Mr Hodosi too. The captain of Mr Hodosi's air force unit liked Mr Hodosi. When the order came to expel all Gypsies from the German army, The captain of my air force unit wrote to Goering. The captain of my air force unit got the response that Mr Hodosi could stay if The captain of my air force unit thinks it’s justifiable. But for the local NSDAP[1] group of Mr Hodosi's hometown it was shameful to have a Gypsy in the German army. the local NSDAP[1] group of my hometown complained about it, so The captain of my air force unit wrote to Hitler. Hitler answered briefly: “When it’s the local NSDAP group’s wish, the local NSDAP[1] group of my hometown have to expel a Gypsy.” So Mr Hodosi took off the uniform and went back to Mr Hodosi's hometown. One night the SS[2] came into the village. the SS[2] came with trucks and randomly loaded entire families. That’s why almost all the Gypsies hastily left the village. Mr Hodosi moved to Gisshübel near Vienna and lived there in a subtenancy. Mr Hodosi's little brother, who still went to school, was expelled. A Gypsy wasn’t an adequate member of society. In the year, Mr Hodosi's wife and Mr Hodosi were arrested by the Gestapo[3] in Gisshübel near Vienna. my wife and I went to the Lackenbach reception camp in Burgenland. In the Lackenbach reception camp in Burgenland my wife and I got a foretaste of what was in store for my wife and I. the SS[2] beat my wife and I. The food was horrible. Mr Hodosi did the only thing possible and tried to flee. In fact Mr Hodosi's wife and Mr Hodosi were able to escape. Together my wife and I hid in Vienna and lived as so called “submarine boats”. my wife and I were not registered and didn’t get food cards. Because my wife and I had no money, Mr Hodosi had to look for a job. That was very dangerous but Mr Hodosi had no choice. A coal trader was happy to get Mr Hodosi as a delivery man because it was difficult to get male employees at this time. But it happened as Mr Hodosi had foreseen. Mr Hodosi's cover was blown and Mr Hodosi was arrested by the Gestapo again. Three weeks Mr Hodosi was in Rossauerlände prison. During a hearing the the Gestapo official Schreiner said literally: “We will destroy you like cats!” At home Mr Hodosi had a wife and two little children. Two girls, aged one and two years. Mr Hodosi didn’t know if Mr Hodosi would see Two girls, aged one and two years again. But when Mr Hodosi was on the transport to Ausschwitz, the Gestapo brought Mr Hodosi's wife and Two girls, aged one and two years to the station too. Together my wife and the children rode to the Birkenau extermination camp. the transport was an agony. Penned up, without food, without water, without light my wife and the children rode into the unknown. Finally, when the waggons opened the Gestapo received my wife and the children with blows and bloodhounds - my wife and the children were at my wife and the children's destination. In this moment my wife and the children stopped being humans. my wife and the children were just numbers. All that my wife and the children had was taken from my wife and the children. All of us, the women and children too, had All of us, the women and children too's heads shaved. All of us, Mr Hodosi's little girls too, were tattooed with a number. – Then my wife and the children came into the so called entrance barrack. my wife and the children were in the so called entrance barrack about one week until my wife and the children were called to different commandos On the 5th day my wife and the children saw that there are more terrible things than getting almost nothing to eat. 300 people from Burgenland were selected for the gasification and immediately gassed. the Gestapo visibly revelled in the agony of the people. Mr Hodosi came with Mr Hodosi's wife to the commando ”earthworks”. Amongst other places, my wife and the children laid rails to the crematories. Every day from 9 – 10 there was the so called “punishment work”. In this hour my wife and the children had to do work on the double. When someone fell down with a heavy barrow or tippler, they battered him to death immediately. So my wife and the children lost 50 – 60 people daily. In the morning the Gestapo whispered to the “Capo”[4] the number of people who should not come back anymore. And the “Capo”[4 tried to fulfill this order. For all children the camp was certain death. There was no nourishing food, no milk, nothing a child needs for the development of the body. In addition to that the uncertain life. No minute were you safe. my wife and the children had to muster in the night for hours - little children too – which made hounded, tortured beings of my wife and the children. Very often the SS[2] made fun of my wife and the children. the SS[2] lined my wife and the children up and selected those who had to go to the gas. Sometimes it was true, sometimes not. During this time Mr Hodosi lost Mr Hodosi's two young children. my two young children literally died of hunger. The food was the following: 5 people got daily: 1 army bread. Every prisoner got also: 1 spoon marmalade, ½ kg swede and sometimes 50 grammes of ham and 20 grammes of margarine. There were extra portions too but always for a special purpose. The result of the distribution led very often to affrays. There were always people killed. The hunger was big. In addition to The hunger came epidemics of typhus, malaria, mange etc. The sick people were gassed. So they reduced my wife and the children's number from 24,000 to 7,000 within one year. the year, in Burgenland and as Mr Hodosi heard in Lackenbach (Burgenland) too they selected especially dark-skinned Gypsies (men and women) for transports to Bergen-Belsen. They did experiments with especially dark-skinned Gypsies (men and women) to find out how long a man can survive without food and drink. At the end of the year they organised further transports. They seperated people who were fit for the military and such young women and men who agreed to be part of sterilisation experiments, in the hope of freedom. They were promised release from the camp but the truth was very different. 8 days after such an operation, which was done without anaesthetic, they had to go back to work. Many perished because of that. Mr Hodosi became part of the so called “Bewährungstruppe” and was installed at the front near Cottbus on 12th April 1945. Those who didn’t die during the fighting were killed by the Gestapo from behind. From 4,000 men just 700 survived. my wife and the children were happy to get into Russian imprisonment. Later Mr Hodosi heard that none of the 4,000 who stood in Burgenland lived anymore. the 4,000 who stood in Birkenau were all gassed. - 5 - Addition to report of Mr Hodosi: Mr Hodosi managed the escape from the Lackenbach reception camp in Burgenland as follows: Mr Hodosi worked on road building. We took breakfast next to a forest. Once the opportunity was good and Mr Hodosi fled into the forest. After about 3 minutes they noticed that Mr Hodosi was missing. They followed Mr Hodosi but Mr Hodosi could cover Mr Hodosi's tracks. During Mr Hodosi's escape Mr Hodosi came into a Hungarian area. At Ödenburg Mr Hodosi entered Austrian land again and went to Mattersburg. From there Mr Hodosi took the train to Vienna, illegally of course. Yes Mr Hodosi's wife was a Gypsy too. The 300 Burgenländer who were gassed were all Gypsies. The reduction from 24,000 to 7,000 concerned only Gypsies. In Burgenland we were in a part of the camp which was managed as a family camp and which got the name “Gypsy camp”. The 4,000 who did military service were made up from all kinds of prisoners. So The 4,000 who did military service weren’t all Gypsies. All 700, who were left, were rescued because they went into Russian imprisonment.

After the German invasion husband and two daughters sent one girl to England with a children's transport. husband and two daughters and the second daughter were sent to Theresienstadt in 1942. Czech Jews had been prepared for the life in the ghetto by information spread by members of the Prague Kultusgemeinde and the Czech guards of the ghetto. Yet, on arrival Mrs Singer was struck by the spirit of desolation and apathy amongst the inmates. Even Mrs Singer's own mother and sister showed no signs of joy at being reunited with Mrs Singer. Mrs Singer had had some nursing experience and volunteered for this type of work. Mrs Singer knew that this type of work might give Mrs Singer some protection from deportation, the fear of which overshadowed the whole life of the prisoners. In the first very cold winter typhoid broke out. The patients were crammed into attics without the most elementary necessities. Later a hospital was equipped, and conditions improved a little. Mrs Singer was infected, and after Mrs Singer's recovery was ordered to nurse The patients. Mrs Singer's girl had been sent to a children's home run by Dr. Groak who maintained a certain ethical standard among the children. Mrs Singer joined a Zionist Group, and the special protection of one of the the ghetto Elders, one of the Ghetto Elders, himself a Zionist a Zionist, might have saved Mrs Singer from deportation. Quite a lot of bitterness and ill-will was caused by the Ghetto Elders favouring members of the Elders favouring members of their own nationality, religious or political group's own nationality, religious or political group. Mrs Singer's husband, mother and sister were deported. Mrs Singer was saved by a miracle. Mrs Singer was already standing at the train, when Mrs Singer was her return back for no apparent reason. As discipline had crumbled by that time, nobody noticed that Mrs Singer did not report back on Mrs Singer's return, and soon afterwards Theresienstadt was liberated. 9.

Bach in the West London Synagogue Review were repeated later on by the Dean of St. Paul's, Matthews. Ghetto Life in Constant Fear of Deportation Mrs Singer is a Czech Jewess who lived with Mrs Singer's husband and two daughters in Barduwitz, Czechoslovakia. After the German invasion, they still managed to send one of the children with a Kindertransport to England. In the winter of 1942 Mrs Singer, together with Mrs Singer's husband and the second daughter, was sent to Theresienstadt. Mrs Singer emphasized how much better prepared, physically and mentally, the Czech Jews arrived at the grey fortress. For a start, the Czech Jews were a great deal better nourished because the Czech population was much more well-disposed towards Jews than the Germans, slipping Jews whatever food Jews could spare at all. Mrs Singer is also aware of several cases where Czechs offered to hide Jewish children [in safe places] to protect Jewish children from the worst. Furthermore, the Czech policemen guarding Theresienstadt had circulated reports about the conditions there, and the Prague Jewish Congregation[1] sent the Prague Jewish Congregation[1]'s employees out to individual Jewish congregations with instructions to prepare its employees “for a life of poverty and work”. For that reason, the Czechs did not arrive in Theresienstadt as completely unprepared as the German Jews, whose luggage contained high-heeled shoes and evening cloaks. From Theresienstadt onwards, the prisoners had to walk and carry the prisoners's heavy luggage. Upon the prisoners's arrival in Theresienstadt, the prisoners immediately gained an impression of the oppressive atmosphere of fear, desperation and apathy. At the arrival of a new transport there was always a curfew and no one was allowed to be out on the street. However, from people's windows people looked down upon the new arrivals. No one nodded at people, waved or smiled. Mrs Singer's sister and Mrs Singer's 80-year-old mother were already in Theresienstadt, but even the reunion of family members did not bring a moment of joy. Mrs Singer found Mrs Singer's mother in a bare room, which Mrs Singer shared with 18 other women, lying on the floor. There were no beds. her 80-year-old mother began to cry bitterly when her 80-year-old mother saw her 80-year-old mother's daughter and granddaughter again. Mrs Singer was unable to help her daughter and granddaughter; “help”, for Mrs Singer, had become identical with “food”, old people getting the most meagre rations of all. Upon arriving, the newcomers had first to pass through a German “sluice gate”, where the newcomers were assigned work. Mrs Singer had had some training in nursing care and immediately applied for care work. Mrs Singer already knew that this would provide Mrs Singer with special protection from being sent to one of the extermination camps. Mrs Singer was immediately separated from Mrs Singer's husband. Men were mostly housed in the old barracks, 80 to 100 to a room, three bunk beds, one above the other. During the first, very cold, winter of 1942, a typhoid epidemic broke out and Mrs Singer worked from morning until night. The sick were placed in attic rooms, where it was particularly cold, lying on the floor in their totally soiled clothes, without bedclothes. There were no medicines to help the sick, not even towels to wash them with. All patients were covered in lice, but it was not possible to send All patients for delousing because of the risk of infection. At the start of Mrs Singer's shift in the morning, Mrs Singer had to inspect the closely crammed-together bodies to establish who was still alive and who had died [during the night]. Often it was barely possible to tell as the people lying there on the floor were totally starved and lifeless. After two months Mrs Singer too, contracted typhoid fever. Meanwhile, a gymnasium had been converted into a hospital as the Germans, fearful a typhoid epidemic would spread, insisted on isolating those infected with typhoid fever. There were, however, still no medicines, the food was just about sufficient to avoid starvation and, although there were many doctors available, only nature could help the individual. At that time, a couple who were both doctors, Drs. Teweles, worked at the hospital, looking after the sick with great dedication. the second daughter had also been infected and died owing to the lack of medicines. Later both doctors were taken to one of the extermination camps. As surviving the illness had left Mrs Singer immune to typhoid fever, Mrs Singer was chosen especially and ordered to care for those infected with typhoid fever. Slowly conditions improved slightly, medicines arrived at one of the extermination camps, the constant transports of people to the extermination camps created more space for those left behind, and the total apathy that gradually took hold of people did, of course, help people bear the terrible conditions. One could perhaps even have accustomed oneself to a certain structure of ghetto life, if only the fear of the constant transports of people to the extermination camps and the constant farewells had not continually reignited the sense of terror and agitation. The worst was when the children were deported. Although Mrs Singer's daughter was spared, Mrs Singer's husband, Mrs Singer's mother and Mrs Singer's sister had to make the journey to death. Mrs Singer had been discharged from hospital by Mrs Singer's mother and was sent to one of the children's homes that was under the direction of Dr. Groak. Dr. Groak is said to have exerted a very good influence, which meant that decent standards prevailed at one of the children’s homes that was under the direction of Dr. Groak. For inexplicable reasons, a number of furniture deliveries arrived at the ghetto, as a result of which a few decent pieces of furniture and even a piano found a few decent pieces of furniture and even a piano's way to the children's home. Here Mrs Singer joined a Zionist Group and as the then ghetto Elder was also a Zionist, the children were under the then ghetto Elder's special protection and were therefore saved from deportation. the then ghetto Elder not only took care of the children's physical welfare by finding the children, for example, gardening work, but also saw to the young people’s physical welfare that the children did not degenerate completely morally and spiritually. This preferential treatment by whoever was the ghetto Elder at the time, based on religious attitude and even more so on nationality, had, of course, considerable disadvantages and created much bitterness and discord. If you wanted to survive Theresienstadt, it was eventually said, you needed to have four P.G.s – not “Parteigenossen” [party members][3], but Polish grandmothers. Ultimately, the ghetto Elders decided who would live and who would die. Although the Gestapo ordered that so-and-so many people were to make up a specific transport, the selection of the individuals to be sent was decided by the ghetto Elders; and one knew with cynical certainty, depending on the relevant Elder’s nationality, who would constitute the majority of a specific transport. Incidentally, none of the ghetto Elders survived Theresienstadt; because none of these Elders knew too much, none of these Elders were systematically deported to the East. Just before the English[4] and the Russians were approaching [the camp], the Elder at that time, Dr. Epstein, gave an address, to the effect that the Elder at that time, Dr. Epstein was now the helmsman and would bring the Elder at that time, Dr. Epstein's ship safely to harbour. The following day the Germans came for the Elder at that time, Dr. Epstein. When asked about the attitude of non-Jews to the internees, Mrs Singer replied that Mrs Singer had had hardly any contact with non-Jews. Everything was handled by the Council of Elders, individual prisoners did not come into contact with individual prisoners's non-Jewish oppressors at all. Some among the prisoners were Christians, who had only been made aware of their Jewish ancestry by the Hitler laws[5]. In Czechoslovakia, only those who had been baptised “lying flat”[6] were considered Christians. There were two Viennese women among Mrs Singer's colleagues at the hospital who had never known of Mrs. Singer’s colleagues at the hospital who had never known of their Jewish blood's Jewish blood. two Viennese women among Mrs. Singer’s colleagues at the hospital who had never known of their Jewish blood were self-sacrificing nurses and, as Mrs Singer frankly admitted, some of the few who practiced their profession because they loved to help, and not because it would protect them from deportation. Altruism and ethical principles could not flourish in the atmosphere of Theresienstadt where, at the end of the day, everyone had to fend for themselves and self-preservation became the supreme law. Mrs Singer stressed repeatedly that no one who has not been through this kind of camp could possibly understand how the experience deadened every human emotion. Even today Mrs Singer feels that there are no words that can truly reach and get through to “the others”. As if by a miracle, Mrs Singer was saved from death. Mrs Singer had already been selected for a transport, standing with Mrs Singer's rucksack at the so-called “sluice” by the train, when Mrs Singer was called back. Mrs Singer's daughter had been protected by Mrs Singer's gardening work, though Mrs Singer did assist, together with other young Zionist people, with the transports and had promised Mrs Singer's mother to jump on to the train at the very last moment so they would stay together. As Mrs Singer did not see Mrs Singer's mother, Mrs Singer stayed behind. In fact, Mrs Singer should have been issued with a “rejection note” to continue receiving accommodation and food in the ghetto. However, by this time organization in the camp was no longer that tight and no one bothered with these formalities. Many who were summoned for a transport simply didn’t report for a transport and saved Many who were summoned for a transport's lives that way. After the liberation of Theresienstadt, Mrs Singer lived in Czechoslovakia until 1949, then went to join the daughter who had emigrated to Israel, from where Mrs Singer came to England. Mrs Singer recalls that Dr. Groak came to visit some of Mrs Singer's patients, although Mrs Singer is unable to remember that Dr. Groak's presence left much of an impression on some of her patients. Mrs Singer stresses repeatedly how cynical and apathetic life in Theresienstadt had left the prisoners, “so that the presence of a rabbi no longer made an impression”. Mrs Singer, as a Czech and not much involved with Judaism, had never heard of Dr. Groak; so Dr. Groak's visits did not mean anything to Mrs Singer. Mrs Singer now thinks that the “legend Baeck” in Theresienstadt has been retrospectively idealised. Neither had Mrs Singer been sentenced to death, as death sentences did not exist in Theresienstadt; nor does the claim that Mrs Singer was saved from death by the Germans correspond to the facts. During the final weeks, the Red Cross handled the administration of the camp, so there was no need for liberation by the Germans to prevent a death sentence. Had there been any intention of getting Mrs Singer out of the way at an earlier date, the frequent deportations would have provided ample opportunity to do so.

42,"['Edith Neumann, an orphan, was only 14 years old when in September 1942 Edith and Edith's aunt had to follow Edith's grandmother to Theresienstadt who was already among the first deportees from Vienna. The report includes details about the German-speaking Kinderheim there - modern pedagogical methods, a kind of Kibbutz where the children were happy in spite of everything. When later Edith's aunt and grandmother were taken to Auschwitz, Edith - voluntarily - followed she and her aunt with the next transport and met she and her aunt there. Soon her grandmother was gassed and Edith and Edith's aunt were moved to Hamburg for forced labour. Terrible housing conditions (“Lagerhaus”), lack of food, heavy airraids. The kind Italian Prisoner of War who looked after Edith and the “Wehrmachtssoldat”, one of the guards, who wanted to hide Edith with the “Wehrmachtssoldat”, one of the guards, who wanted to hide Edith with his wife's wife; Edith refusing because of Edith's aunt and a close girl friend whom Edith did not want to leave. Increasing air raids shifted to Altona where conditions were worse. Edith worked in a cement factory, together with Russian and Italian Prisoners of War, all kind and helpful, especially the Russians. When the British army was approaching Edith was sent on a Death March to Bergen-Belsen where Edith was ultimately liberated by the English. Edith stayed on in Bergen-Belsen where she was ultimately liberated by the English until 1948 and put Edith at the disposal of the American Joint for relief work . In spring 1948 Edith emigrated to England, becoming a nurse at University College London. At Bergen-Belsen where she was ultimately liberated by the English Irma Grese with Irma Grese's dogs. Edith When Hitler came to Vienna, Edith was barely 10 years old. Edith's parents were both dead. Edith's grandmother took over the role of parent. There was a close bond between her grandmother and grandchild, as grandchild was deported to Theresienstadt who was already among the first deportees from Vienna, Edith's only care was the absolute certainty that Edith would soon follow Edith there. Now, Edith's aunt assumed the role of caring for Edith. Edith's aunt was a Nurse at the Rothschild Hospital in Vienna. the Rothschild Hospital in Vienna was annexed to the Cultural Association and it was known from experience that such employees were sent to Theresienstadt who was already among the first deportees from Vienna. Edith went there with Edith's aunt in 1942; met Edith's grandmother, who lived in a room with 12 other women; and was again separated from Edith, since Edith was housed in a German children\'s home. A ‘German children\'s home’ in this context meant that the children all had a very strong command of the English, in contrast to the Czech children, who lived together in another home. the children all's home was managed in the most exemplary manner by a young Czech man and a young Czech man's four friends. a young Czech man and his four friends turned the children all's home into a Kibbutz. a German children\'s home consisted of five to six rooms. Within each room were housed 20 girls between 10 and 16 years of age. On the opposite side was where the boys lived. Within five to six rooms, the bunks were stacked three high. the bunks slept in pairs. So that five to six rooms was kept tidy, there was a competition amongst the children all. The cleanest room received a prize - in points. The eldest girl supervised. The elder children taught the younger; The elder children learnt languages; The elder children also worked within the garden, which lay outside the ghetto. Every evening, when The elder children came back from work, The elder children were searched to see if The elder children had taken an apple or a carrot. The elder children also had to wear a yellow Star of David Patch. Edith was unable to make sense of the rations; Edith only knew that Edith suffered hunger, yet, food played not so great a role, as for a child, there was so much to see, to take in and to understand; the separation from Edith's home from Edith's home, from Edith's grandmother, communal life with so many children and the totally different meaning of life. Somehow, life was still worth living, until roughly two years later, the deportations began. On each occasion, 1,000 people were taken, never being seen again. One day, her grandmother and aunt were also taken (Edith's aunt also worked as a Nurse in Theresienstadt who was already among the first deportees from Vienna). Edith did not know where the transport went, yet on the next deportation, Edith volunteered for the transport; Edith did not want to leave Edith's grandmother alone. - 2 - They travelled in a wagon, two days and two nights, without food, without drink and without sleep. For purposes of ablutions etc.., two buckets were set out. They sat next to each other without being able to move them. During the night, the train suddenly stopped. The guards shouted ""Get out!"" They had arrived in Auschwitz. They heard terrible screaming, it smelled horrifically of human bones. They stood before a square building; they saw flames rise. It was the crematorium. Bundles of hair lay roundabout, as well as children\'s shoes and clothes. An electric wire circled a German children\'s home; whoever touched An electric wire was killed immediately. children\'s were warned. Auschwitz was divided into different camps; children, women, men and old people. Edith's name had been tattooed onto Edith's arm; A-3705. The scar is still visible today. (In England, a Surgeon cut out this Nazi branding). The huts in which children, women, men and old people lived looked like stables. Within the so-called family camp, the women lived on one side, the men on the other. children, women, men and old people changed very terribly. children, women, men and old people looked like animals. children, women, men and old people got leather straps and were beaten blindly on all sides. The head of the so-called family camp was a robber. The head of the camp had, at one time, committed a bank robbery and had murdered people during a bank robbery's course. As punishment, they sent The head of the camp to Auschwitz. The days proceeded thus: Early of a morning, at 4 o\'clock, everyone was required for parade called \'Appel\'; people stood or kneeled until 10 o\'clock in the morning. Then, two SS men came to count. After two SS men had done this, we were given a beaker of soup and a slice of bread. From 3 o\'clock in the afternoon until 6 o\'clock in the evening \'Appel\' was held again. two SS men were mostly drunk and took people spontaneously from the rows of people. A man and a woman were shot dead without any such reason before Edith's eyes. A man and a woman took a baby from the children\'s home and dashed a baby's little head against the wall. After Appel, the prisoners were allowed to mix with one another for an hour. And, on the second day, Edith saw Edith's grandmother and Edith's aunt again. After three weeks, during Appel, all those between 16 and 36 years of age were taken out. Although Edith was not yet 16 years of age, she too reported Edith, as Edith knew that were Edith to stay in Auschwitz, the gas chamber would await. Edith and Edith's aunt had to undress completely; her grandmother and her aunt were examined, probably to see if her grandmother and her aunt were capable of work. Edith did not know what would happen to Edith. Edith ran quickly once more to Edith's grandmother, in order to say farewell. An SS man stood there with a loaded revolver and urged her grandmother and her aunt to hurry up. Yet, her grandmother had time enough to bless her grandmother's grandchild. - 3 - Then, Edith arrived with Edith's aunt and a friend Edith met in Auschwitz in a women\'s camp, where career criminals ran Auschwitz. Thousands of women were housed there within a stable block. Within both washrooms with water-taps, a cruel woman, the oldest in a women\'s camp, where career criminals ran the place, governed over Thousands of women. a cruel woman, the oldest in the camp had a leather strap in a cruel woman, the oldest in the camp's hand and would beat anyone a cruel woman, the oldest in the camp could. Those women imprisoned within a women\'s camp, where career criminals ran the place would be forgiven were Thousands of women to do without washing altogether. After two days, Edith, Edith's aunt and the friend went to a delousing station. Edith, her aunt and the friend had to get undressed there. Edith, her aunt and the friend were given prison clothes. After spending four weeks at Auschwitz, Edith, her aunt and the friend were all transported in a cattle wagon, this time under the watch of German soldiers, who were not war veterans. German soldiers, who were not war veterans were more lenient; German soldiers, who were not war veterans had a touch of humanity. Edith was in a very bad state. There was terribly little to eat, then the horrific fear in which Edith continually lived, for one, of course, did not know what would happen from one moment to the next; a lack of blood to the brain, which makes this whole cruel experience appear so unreal and lacking in care. Edith, her aunt and the friend travelled for two days and two nights, arriving in Hamburg and were taken to a camp block; this was in May 1944. Around 1,000 women were divided into groups and sent to work in a factory guarded by soldiers. Within a camp block were also housed Italian prisoners of war. Around 1,000 women had to work hard in a factory guarded by soldiers... shovelling sand, lugging bricks etc. a factory guarded by soldiers lay far away from both washrooms with water-taps. At 4 o\'clock in the morning, Around 1,000 women were loaded onto boats, where Around 1,000 women travelled for two hours along the Elbe to a factory guarded by soldiers. In Around 1,000 women's thin, grey linen clothes, Around 1,000 women succumbed terribly to the cold. Whenever it rained, Around 1,000 women took off Around 1,000 women's wet clothes to wring their thin, grey linen clothes and then to put their thin, grey linen clothes on again. There was nothing to eat until the afternoon, only then a slice of bread and a bowl of soup. Only German boys were employed in a factory guarded by soldiers. Sometimes, Only German boys threw Only German boys sandwiches. Around 1,000 women came back from work at 5 o\'clock in the evening to both washrooms with water-taps. The rooms had long troughs with taps, Around 1,000 women washed there and then; there was soup once more with a slice of bread. This is where Edith experienced the first bombs. During an air raid, Around 1,000 women had to go down into a factory guarded by soldiers. a factory guarded by soldiers led to the Elbe. Edith and Edith's friends preferred to sleep in Edith and her friends's beds; Edith and her friends hid Edith and her friends under Edith and her friends's beds, so that no-one found Edith and her friends. Edith and her friends only crept out when everyone else was in a factory guarded by soldiers. Edith and her friends were dead tired and slept soundly, despite an air raid. As already mentioned, Italian prisoners of war were housed in both washrooms with water-taps. Edith became friends with one of Edith and her friends; his name was Aldo Babieri. He spoke many languages fluently; he\'d also secretly hidden a warm pullover and some food. He also had a medallion, which he gave to Edith as a gift; - 4 - he got a medallion, which he gave to her as a gift from his mother. Edith still has a medallion, which he gave to her as a gift today. One day, when Edith and her friends had to work clearing the streets in Hamburg, people passed by and stared at Edith and her friends. It was only then that Edith became aware exactly how greatly Edith had changed. Edith began to cry; Edith began to do so hysterically. ""Why don\'t you shoot Edith?"" Edith shouted at the soldier who guarded Edith. the soldier who guarded her sent Edith to the guard post and followed Edith there. the soldier who guarded her said ""the soldier who guarded her feel more for you all than the soldier who guarded her am allowed to show. the soldier who guarded her have a daughter; a daughter is 15 years old. as old as you are. You remind the soldier who guarded her of a daughter's"" The soldier, whose name Edith did not remember - perhaps the soldier who guarded her was called Kessel, often brought Edith something to eat. As the soldier who guarded her knew that Edith shared everything with Edith's aunt and friend, the soldier who guarded her gave Edith three small parcels; one for each of three small parcels. the soldier who guarded her once said to Edith ""Edith speak German. I\'ll bring Edith clothes and help Edith get to Berlin to the soldier who guarded her's wife. Edith can stay there until everything is over"". Edith refused; Edith did not want to leave Edith's aunt and friend. Four months had passed and she and her aunt were taken to a camp in Altona, which was guarded by female members of the SS. female members of the SS were terrible; even the Camp Commandant was fearful. even the Camp Commandant threw female members of the SS to the ground, kicked and beat and trampled on female members of the SS with even the Camp Commandant's hobnailed boots. even the Camp Commandant was an abnormal person. The eldest within a women\'s camp, where career criminals ran the place could only keep even the Camp Commandant calm by going to even the Camp Commandant and saying how handsome even the Camp Commandant was and how magnificent to behold. This compliment calmed even the Camp Commandant. The terrible the SS women left Edith and her grandmother in peace, perhaps because female members of the SS were so young, only 15 years old! female members of the SS even gave female members of the SS warm things. Once, during a particularly heavy air raid, female members of the SS were sent into a bunker, just Edith and Edith's friend. a bunker, just Edith and her friend was in a bridge, which had a cement structure and a door. When a bridge, which had a cement structure and a door was opened, female members of the SS were inside a bunker, just Edith and her friend. Outside, bombs rained down. Suddenly, a door was torn open and a whole load of Russian prisoners of war entered to hide from the bombs. Around 1,000 women were terribly afraid; Edith's friend began to scream. an air raid ebbed away and a soldier opened the little window. The Russians asked Edith who Edith was. The Russians told the men of Around 1,000 women's fate. The Russians emptied The Russians's pockets and gave Around 1,000 women everything The Russians had in terms of confectionery and other things. And, when The Russians had nothing else to give, The Russians sang Russian songs to The Russians to console The Russians. Edith worked in a factory guarded by soldiers along with Russians, French and Italians. The Russians were the kindest; The Russians passed on news to them. The Russians were able to find just the right words of comfort. This gave The Russians courage and strength. Edith, Edith's aunt and friend had to work very hard; Edith had to build houses, canals and trenches. an air raid became ever worse; - 5 - the English troops were not too far away; as a result of which the Nazis transported female members of the SS to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. female members of the SS withstood three weeks in a room with thousands of women. female members of the SS lay or sat on top of each other; female members of the SS's feet could only find room on other feet. Many women died, many suffocated. On the death-march to Belsen, innumerable women were left behind on the roadside; innumerable women died from weakness or were shot. Irma Grese was there with Irma Grese's dog...., Edith saw Irma Grese. The worst of all were the Hungarian soldiers, who had become wild and who shot incessantly at people; even through locked doors. The corpses lay roundabout in large piles. The food was horrific; dirty red turnip peelings; despite desperate hunger, Edith was unable to eat The food. For 14 days, Edith ate nothing. Edith was so weak that Edith could no longer stand on Edith's feet. Edith thought that the end had come for Edith. Edith crawled over the bodies, towards freedom. It was dark, yet Edith recognised a figure approaching Edith. Bald headed and emaciated, Edith heard Bald's name being called. ""Dita!"" Bald was a former schoolmate. Edith was unable to answer, as Edith could see a tank enter a women\'s camp, where career criminals ran the place. the English troops had arrived as liberators. Bald summoned up all Bald's strength, crept back into a room with thousands of women to tell the others; many did not want to believe it, many wept, many were apathetic and could do nothing. For so very many, freedom came too late! the English troops arrived with two large pails of soup. Unfortunately, the English troops ate too much of the unaccustomed nourishing food....; A great many became sick, others died. Edith spent a few days in a wonderful camp for soldiers, from where Edith quickly recovered, whilst Edith's aunt and Edith's friend contracted typhus and had to be admitted to hospital. Edith remained and made Edith available to the English troops. Edith assumed responsibility for registration duties, concerning people from the so-called family camp into Belsen. Edith was one of the last in the so-called family camp. There were people, who did not want to go. It took a lot of persuading to get people, who did not want to go out of these insanitary conditions; people, who did not want to go had lost people, who did not want to go's minds. the soldier who guarded her did a great deal for people, who did not want to go. the soldier who guarded her helped wherever the soldier who guarded her could. According to the soldier who guarded her's rank, the soldier who guarded her was probably not the most senior; yet the soldier who guarded her suffered alongside people, who did not want to go, the soldier who guarded her helped find Edith's aunt and friend. Edith's aunt is in England; the friend in America. This friend, who once gave Edith a potato for Edith's birthday, whilst at a women\'s camp, where career criminals ran the place; - 6 - a potato had been the most delicious gift her grandmother had ever received. For a potato not only had an inscribed face; a potato was also edible. her grandmother remained in Theresienstadt who was already among the first deportees from Vienna for two years.

43,"['This report is interesting because This report shows the important role the Jewish resistance movement played during the German occupation of France and the many ways in which the Jewish resistance movement was assisted by the French population. This report is written by the above, who in 1933, as a child of 6, left Frankfurt am Main with the above, who in 1933, as a child of 6, left Frankfurt am Main with her parents and her sister and emigrated to France's parents and the above, who in 1933, as a child of 6, left Frankfurt am Main with her parents and her sister and emigrated to France's sister and emigrated to France. As soon as Hitler invaded Northern France in 1940, the travels of the family started. the family were among the thousands and thousands of refugees who crowded the roads to the south of France, stayed at different places which the family had always to leave after a short while. Mr Guenzburg, the father, was several times interned, but either was released or succeeded to escape from the camp. In autumn 1943, when the Germans occupied the south of France, the Jewish resistance movement saw to it that all children found shelter. the Jewish resistance movement was so well organized that the Jewish resistance movement was able to follow up the fate of almost every child. Many of all children were taken, to convents and were thought by Many of the children's surroundings to be Christians. the above, who in 1933, as a child of 6, left Frankfurt am Main with her parents and her sister and emigrated to France and the above, who in 1933, as a child of 6, left Frankfurt am Main with her parents and her sister and emigrated to France's sister were taken to a boarding School at Villeneuve sur Lot, where only the director, a Protestant knew her parents and her sister's origin. In 1944 the above, who in 1933, as a child of 6, left Frankfurt am Main with her parents and her sister and emigrated to France and the above, who in 1933, as a child of 6, left Frankfurt am Main with her parents and her sister and emigrated to France's father crossed the Spanish border in one of the small groups of 10 people, regularly organized by the Jewish resistance movement. With the help of the American Joint, her parents and her sister finally reached Israel. Mr Guenzburg, the father and Mr Guenzburg, the father's other daughter, who were staying in a home for aged people belonging to the “Heilsarmee” at Tonnein and would not have been able to endure the flight over the mountains, followed her parents and her sister a year later. Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s time as a child refugee in France Experiences of Mr Guenzburg, the father, During the Rule of the National Socialists. In 1933, at the time the National Socialists came to power in France, Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) was living with Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s parents and Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s elder sister in Frankfurt am Main. Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s father ran a bookshop there. a bookshop there was taken over by the National Socialist administration already in early 1933. As Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s father also felt her father to be personally in danger, her father left Frankfurt and relocated to Paris. Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s mother, Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s sister and Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) followed her father about 6 months later. Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) was 6 years old at the time. In Paris, My mother, my sister and I lived in peace until the beginning of the war. After the outbreak of the war, the French authorities issued an order for all families with children to be evacuated from Paris to the French countryside. The evacuation of the inhabitants of each neighbourhood was designated for a specific department. In September 1939, Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s father brought My mother, my sister and I to Nevers near Orléans in Viévre, the department responsible for My mother, my sister and I. her father went back to Paris with the intention of voluntarily enlisting in the military. her father was, however, not accepted – in fact, her father was interned by the French as a former German. It was only shortly before the German invasion of France that her father was released. Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s father then attempted to join the Foreign Legion. In this too her father was unsuccessful, as her father did not appear to be physically suited. Eventually, her father managed to join a British Army labour battalion. My mother, my sister and I stayed in Nevers near Orléans in Viévre, the department responsible for us until June 1940. At that time, the German troops had already moved into France. Apparently, a defence front was to be formed at the Loire, very close to where My mother, my sister and I were. As a consequence, the inhabitants of this region fled southwards. My mother, my sister and I joined the flow of refugees and came to Château de Chaumont (Creuse). There was a children’s home here belonging to the Jewish organisation OSE, where My mother, my sister and I found accommodation for the time being. By chance, My mother, my sister and I met her father there and were reunited. In September 1940, My mother, my sister and I relocated to Aubusson with a few of the other children looked after by the Jewish organisation OSE, as there was a lyceum that My mother, my sister and I could attend there. Shortly after, in November 1940, her father was interned as a German Jew by the Vichy government and brought to Gurs. Later, her father went to a labour camp, but was released in March 1941 as her father had leased a piece of land near Aubusson to convert a piece of land near Aubusson for agricultural use, which exempted her father from internment. - 2 - her father was now restricted only in her father's freedom of movement and was, like My mother, my sister and I, not allowed to leave Château de Chaumont (Creuse) without permission. In Aubusson, My mother, my sister and I lived as penniless refugees in difficult conditions. My mother, my sister and I had taken in the children who had been entrusted to My mother, my sister and I by the Jewish organisation OSE and who went to the local school together with My mother, my sister and I, and received financial support for this from OSE, which was, however, only very little money and barely sufficient to make ends meet. In the summer of the time, My mother, my sister and I learned that the danger for German Jews who had been arrested by the Vichy authorities to be transported back to France had grown immensely. At the time, My mother, my sister and I were constantly in contact with the French-Jewish scout movement, which had formed resistance groups everywhere. the French-Jewish scout movement, which had formed resistance groups everywhere offered to attempt to get us children to Switzerland. During this time, Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s sister and Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) were My mother, my sister and I constantly wearing scout uniforms as this was safer for My mother, my sister and I. My mother, my sister and I agreed to be separated from My mother, my sister and I's parents, but were afraid that something would happen to My mother, my sister and I if My mother, my sister and I's disappearance from Château de Chaumont (Creuse) became known. It was therefore agreed that Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s parents would say My mother, my sister and I had run away from My mother, my sister and I. Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s sister and Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.), as well as a few other Jewish children, were initially brought to Montpellier. Here, My mother, my sister and I were housed by various families. The plan was to bring My mother, my sister and I from there to Annecy, where us children would be gathered for the crossing to Switzerland. At the last moment, however, The plan had to be abandoned, because the preceding group that was to be brought to Switzerland had been sent back to France by the Swiss authorities. My mother, my sister and I now went to a children’s home in Moissac near Toulouse, which had been set up by the Joint Distribution Committee. Here, Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) was in the care of the director of a children’s home in Moissac near Toulouse, which had been set up by the Joint Distribution Committee, under the alias Evelyne Ginsbourg with Andlau (Bas-Rhin) as Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s place of birth. This was necessary to avoid difficulties with the French authorities, which occurred especially when the French authorities were dealing with foreign Jews over the age of 14 years. the French authorities were therefore regularly provided with false papers indicating the French authorities to be French citizens. Thanks to the good connections the director of a children’s home in Moissac near Toulouse, which had been set up by the Joint Distribution Committee had with the authorities, the authorities intervened only rarely and sent a German-Jewish resident of a children’s home in Moissac near Toulouse, which had been set up by the Joint Distribution Committee back to France only every now and again, in order to keep up appearances. In the meantime, Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s father had been brought to a labour camp again. When it became known that the camp inmates - 3 - were to be transferred to France, Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s father escaped from there after being provided with false papers by the Jewish resistance movement. her father managed to obtain a position as a worker on a farm. The farmers liked to take on refugees as workers as The farmers did not need to pay refugees much; however, The farmers generally did not treat refugees very well. Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s mother had stayed behind in Aubusson for the time being. When it became too dangerous for My mother to continue staying there, Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) was sent to My mother with false papers that had been issued to My mother. Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) then brought Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s mother to the same village where Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s father was. Here, My mother was taken in by the family. Life in the same village where my father was was particularly difficult for Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s parents as her parents had different names on her parents's papers and could not show that her parents were a married couple. The village priest, who knew this, went out of The village priest, who knew this's way to help her parents. By contrast, the farmer for whom Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s father was working treated the farmer for whom my father was working very badly. When Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s father fell sick, the farmer for whom my father was working simply threw the farmer for whom my father was working out. After this, the Jewish resistance movement directed Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s parents to another village, where Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s father again found work with a farmer. However, her parents soon had to leave another village, where my father again found work with a farmer again as her parents were in danger of being arrested. her parents were now brought to Tonneins farther south. There, Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s parents found work in a Salvation Army retirement home. her parents were posing as Protestants, but the General of Salvation Army knew who her parents were. In the meantime, the south of France had also been occupied by the German troops by October 1943. Shortly before October 1943, the Jewish children’s home in Aubusson, like all other Jewish children’s homes, was dissolved, as Jews of every age were in great danger of being sent to France. the Jewish resistance movement now searched for new accommodation options for us children and were successful. the Jewish resistance movement was exceptionally well-organised and tracked the fate of every individual child. Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) cannot say anything about the type of organisation the Jewish resistance movement was as the Jewish resistance movement were always in contact only with individual members and anything pertaining to individual members's operations was kept very secret. us children were from now on no longer Jews, but posing as Catholics or Protestants. Many were taken in by convents. Posing as a Protestant, Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) was taken in by a boarding school for girls in Villeneuve-sur-Lot in October 1943 together with Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s sister and a few other girls. Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) also had to change Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s name again and was henceforth known as Evelyn Grandjean. Our background was, however, known to the director as well as to several teachers. In Villeneuve-sur-Lot, and already before that in Moissac too, - 4 - the French police and later also the Germans occasionally carried out raids targeting foreign Jews. My mother, my sister and I therefore had to be very careful and Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) went outdoors only rarely. Once, when Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) was in Toulouse, Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) was stopped by a patrol in the street and asked for Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s papers. Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) presented my papers and simultaneously contorted Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s face to hide Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s Jewish facial features as Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) had been taught. Thankfully, a patrol in the street was satisfied. At the time, French hatred of the Germans had already greatly increased, and the Germans helped My mother, my sister and I in whatever ways the Germans possibly could. As soon as the Jewish youths had reached a certain age, the Jewish youths joined the Jewish resistance movement in solidarity. The good relations that had developed with the French Christian families were demonstrated by the fact that My mother, my sister and I regularly received invitations from Christian families on the days My mother, my sister and I had no school, Thursday and Sunday, where My mother, my sister and I usually ate until My mother, my sister and I were properly full. By this time, it was 1944. Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s father had become tired of life in France and decided to cross the border to Switzerland with Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.). My mother, my sister and I could not expect Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s mother to join in the difficult walk over the mountains because of my sister's health. My mother, my sister and I left my sister behind with Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s sister in the Salvation Army home. The crossing of the refugees to Switzerland was led by an organisation that had been created by the Jewish resistance movement. Every few days, the refugees set out on the journey with Spanish guides. Spanish guides were not always trustworthy. Shortly before My mother, my sister and I struck out, a group of refugees had been abandoned by a group of refugees's guides and left to wander in the mountains for 10 days. My mother, my sister and I's guides were trustworthy. After a difficult three-day walk over the mountains, My mother, my sister and I slipped over the border, unscathed, at night. Having arrived in Switzerland, My mother, my sister and I escaped the measures of the Spanish authorities, who were interning all refugees who were 20 to – Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.) believe – 50 years of age. There, My mother, my sister and I were soon in the charge of JOINT, which brought My mother, my sister and I first to Lerida, then to Toulouse, and finally to Cadiz. Months later, My mother, my sister and I were able to begin the journey to Israel from here. As the Germans had in the meantime been driven out of France, Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s mother and Eva Unger, née Guenzburg.)'s sister followed My mother, my sister and I to Israel a year later. - 5 - Transcript.

44,"['A report on some small incidents of anecdotal character demonstrating the kind and helpful attitude of the average Berliner towards the Jews. 4. Date : 1933 onwards. 5. Number of pages : 2. 6. Author or Source : Dr. Martha Mosse, November 1955. 7. Recorded by : as above. 8. References : Berlin. P.III.f. No.183 Advent 1933 or 1934: a teacher makes some disparaging remarks about the Jews to a class (of 6-7 year old little girls). One little one then stands up and says, “But a teacher, how can a teacher say such a thing, when the Lord Jesus is coming soon, and when the Lord Jesus was the Lord Jesus a Jew?” One little one sits down and begins to cry. a teacher says, “One little one, a teacher have to tell One little one these things because the government wants these things that way. But a teacher did not tell One little one to write these things down.” At this, One little one says to the little Jewish girl next to One little one, “Tell One little one that if the little Jewish girl next to her meet One little one.” a teacher told this story to a lady who is a friend of mine. I was sitting on the bus. No one was wearing the yellow star yet. A small, deformed gentleman was sitting next to me, who was obviously Jewish. When a lady got on with a girl aged about ten, who looked very sensitive and miserable, there was standing room only and so A small, deformed gentleman stood up and offered a girl aged about ten, who looked very sensitive and miserable A small, deformed gentleman's seat. At this a girl aged about ten, who looked very sensitive and miserable whispered to a girl aged about ten, who looked very sensitive and miserable's mother, “That was very kind of A small, deformed gentleman.” a lady replied, “Yes, a girl aged about ten, who looked very sensitive and miserable see, and that was a Jew!” One morning during the first few days after the yellow star had been imposed on us, an official from the Jewish community was setting off from an official from the Jewish community's home. Three small girls, who were standing in the road next to the wall of his home, made a deep curtsey when Three small girls, who were standing in the road next to the wall of the building saw an official from the Jewish community and said, “Heil Hitler, Herr Jew!” When an official from the Jewish community asked Three small girls, who were standing in the road next to the wall of the building why Three small girls, who were standing in the road next to the wall of the building were being so polite, Three small girls, who were standing in the road next to the wall of the building replied, “Three small girls, who were standing in the road next to the wall of the building's mother has told Three small girls, who were standing in the road next to the wall of the building that whenever Three small girls, who were standing in the road next to the wall of the building see a Jew, Three small girls, who were standing in the road next to the wall of the building should be particularly friendly.” (an official from the Jewish community told me this an official from the Jewish community). I was on a tram standing by the door (at that time we were no longer allowed a seat, and also by then we were wearing the yellow star), looking out of the window. Then a lady who was obviously a member of the nobility came right up to me and whispered, “Don’t be sad. Lots of people think the way an official from the Jewish community do.” Jews were no longer allowed to use public transport. Only officials from the Jewish community had been given special permits from the Gestapo to travel for work purposes, as an exception was made under these circumstances. I had to go to a municipal department and got on a tram. an official from the Jewish community looked at the yellow star and the the Gestapo permit and came up to me. “an official from the Jewish community must not stand here! an official from the Jewish community's fellow countrymen don’t want an official from the Jewish community so close to Your fellow countrymen. Go and stand there, right at the back, near the exit.” I did so (although I had to stand among other passengers in a tram) and gave an official from the Jewish community one mark, as I had no change. After a while an official from the Jewish community came and threw some coins at my feet with the words, “Here, have your money.” I did not move, but a lady who was standing next to me immediately bent down and picked up your money for me. A very young soldier said to an official from the Jewish community, “If an official from the Jewish community feel like that, an official from the Jewish community’re not suited to this work. We are after all a cultured nation.” (The poor child!). An old lady, obviously a member of the nobility, hissed as an official from the Jewish community was getting out, “What is the number of this coach? an official from the Jewish community has to go.” That was the only occasion when a member of the public was rude to me. It is worth noting that not one of the people there supported an official from the Jewish community. - 2 - During the time when we were no longer allowed to buy any fruit, vegetables, meat, fish etc I knew an official from the Jewish community who told me an official from the Jewish community who told me herself about the following that happened.on the tram about the following that happened.on a tram. There was a wonderful smell of tangerines, and an official from the Jewish community who told me herself about the following that happened.on the tram thought how nice it would be if an official from the Jewish community who told me herself about the following that happened.on the tram could have some one more time. an official from the Jewish community who told me herself about the following that happened.on the tram got out at the station in Friedrich Strasse. Suddenly an official from the Jewish community who told me herself about the following that happened.on the tram heard footsteps, first behind and then next to an official from the Jewish community who told me herself about the following that happened.on the tram and noticed a soldier push some tangerines into an official from the Jewish community who told me herself about the following that happened.on the tram's bag as a soldier went past. Hardly a day went by without my fellow workers telling me that people my fellow workers did not know had put fruit, meat, butter or cigarettes in people they did not know's bag without being noticed. When a little Jewish girl came into the Jewish community, a little Jewish girl had a big apple in a little Jewish girl's hand, and a little Jewish girl's mother told me that a lady wearing a large swastika had quite openly (!) given a little Jewish girl a big apple on a tram. Even shopkeepers joined in. Some sold forbidden goods to the Jews, although at excessively high prices or in exchange for valuables. However the majority tried to help as much as the majority could, on the quiet. For example there was an old potato seller at our market, who would carry the potatoes inside for the Jews. A non-Jewish lady took A non-Jewish lady's own cards, together with those from various people that A non-Jewish lady knew which had been marked with a J, to a tram standing by the door (at that time we were no longer allowed a seat, and also by then we were wearing the yellow star) and bought goods from the stallholders. When on one occasion A non-Jewish lady was denounced by an effeminate informant - who incidentally happened to be Jewish – to an SS man, who was standing around at a tram standing by the door (at that time we were no longer allowed a seat, and also by then we were wearing the yellow star), and an SS man, who was standing around at the market asked A non-Jewish lady to show an SS man, who was standing around at the market the contents of A non-Jewish lady's bag and the food ration cards, A non-Jewish lady refused with the comment that an SS man, who was standing around at the market had no police authority, and turned to the policeman in charge of supervising a tram standing by the door (at that time we were no longer allowed a seat, and also by then we were wearing the yellow star). an SS man, who was standing around at the market sent an SS man, who was standing around at the market packing and took no further action. an SS man, who was standing around at the market even went shopping for elderly Jewish ladies who did not have the strength to go into the shops at the times stipulated for Jews, using elderly Jewish ladies who did not have the strength to go into the shops at the times stipulated for Jews's cards, and an SS man, who was standing around at the market would carry the goods into the building for elderly Jewish ladies who did not have the strength to go into the shops at the times stipulated for Jews, putting in some fish or meat etc. an SS man, who was standing around at the market would only take the right money and would not accept any reward. an SS man, who was standing around at the market also warned Jewish passers-by for example, if – which later happened with the Austrian SS - a raid on Jewish passers-by was going on somewhere in front of Jewish passers, so that Jewish passers could go a different way.

45,"['Mrs Berendsohn and Mrs Berendsohn's husband emigrated from Germany to Denmark in 1933. When the Germans marched in in April 1940, Denmark was crowded with refugees. Mrs Berendsohn's husband Prof. Walter Berendsohn worked in the Danish Resistance Movement and in 1943 her husband had to go into hiding. A German Navy Captain and old friend of Mrs Berendsohn, warned Mrs Berendsohn of the forthcoming measures against Jews and advised Mrs Berendsohn to flee to Denmark. Mrs Berendsohn thereupon co-operated with a Mr Bertelsen, a university lecturer, in building up an organisation which effected the escape of 1,200 Jews to Denmark. In the course of an organisation which effected the escape of 1,200 Jews to Sweden many Danes risked, and some of many Danes lost, many Danes's lives. All those who were detected were taken to concentration camps in Germany. The author states that from Norway about 700 Jews had been deported, and later gassed, as early as 1942. her husband escaped to Denmark with the help of the Danish Resistance Movement. Dora Berendsohn and Dora Berendsohn's daughter followed on 14 October 1943 on one of the last transports. Danish doctors, nurses, railway officials, students and policemen risked Danish doctors, nurses, railway officials, students and policemen's lives to take small groups to a meeting place on the Danish coast. Danish doctors, nurses, railway officials, students and policemen were smuggled into Denmark in fishing boats, under constant danger from German Navy patrols. In Denmark Danish doctors, nurses, railway officials, students and policemen were received with great hospitality. Refugee life in Denmark and escape to Denmark Dear Sister, I had long intended and looked for time to describe in detail how it went for us in the years from 1933-45. I think above all of the years 1940 – 1943, before we came to Denmark. Although we have seen each other in the meantime, several times in fact, but whenever the conversation turned to this time, Dear Sister hardly listened or Dear Sister told with such depth and dramatically of Dear Sister's experiences in Germany that I kept my mouth shut. At least on this topic. By no means do I want to diminish what Dear Sister have gone through in Dear Sister's life, the heavy bombing nights, the hunger, the constant worry about husband and sons in the battlefield. Dear Sister and the other sisters, after all Dear Sister had to hand over Dear Sister's most beloved. – Dear Sister always thought You and the other sisters abroad had nothing to cope with, You and the other sisters had plenty of everything, because You and the other sisters sent Dear Sister packages of whatever You and the other sisters had left over. You and the other sisters went without, regarding the food as well as clothing, so that Dear Sister probably had the impression that You and the other sisters must be doing very well. But You and the other sisters thought of You and the other sisters's old mother, of Dear Sister's little children and the children of the other sisters. You and the other sisters did not enjoy the food if You and the other sisters could not share the food with Dear Sister, so to speak. But You and the other sisters had to work for the food, work hard. You and the other sisters's savings disappeared in the first years after 33 in Denmark. It is after all always difficult to find a footing in a foreign country – and in addition came the sadness and worry for home. Try sometime to move abroad as people between 40 and 50 [years old] with little children and to start from scratch with a new language abroad. After all with You and the other sisters had to go through this starting-from-scratch in a new language again ten years later, when You and the other sisters fled to Sweden. You and the other sisters have found many good friends and in the most difficult time, for You and the other sisters, from 1940-43 in Denmark, it became apparent how many good friends stood with You and the other sisters. In April 1940, one morning German planes came over Denmark and occupied Denmark. From then on everything was dark in the evening and the brightly lit strip of coast on the Swedish side of the Öresund seemed to You and the other sisters like a Fata Morgana. - 2 - You and the other sisters were captured and felt like that too. There was no way out anymore, as all the borders were closed. Denmark was literally bought up by the hungry German soldiers and by a stream of refugees, who had lost a stream of refugees, who had lost their home through bombs or [had been] chased out by the enemy's home through bombs or [had been] chased out by the enemy. a stream of refugees, who had lost their home through bombs or [had been] chased out by the enemy came rolling up from Germany and added to it all. Schools, barracks, large offices and dancing halls were requisitioned and a stream of refugees, who had lost their home through bombs or [had been] chased out by the enemy slept by the hundreds on the floors, sparingly provided with bedlinen, clothing and food. There were thousands and thousands. thousands and thousands were hated by the Danes, because thousands and thousands brought poverty and worry to thousands and thousands's country. – Just at that time, when the Germans attacked Denmark – 9 April 1940 – You and the other sisters's daughter Karin was confined to our daughter Karin's bed as a result of a knee injury and was lying in traction. As our daughter Karin had a place at the window, our daughter Karin heard – and saw – the airplanes bearing Swastikas one morning circling over Denmark and knew immediately what that meant. our daughter Karin screamed and cried and said father would be murdered now. our daughter Karin had to go to father immediately. The whole hospital came running, doctors and nurses tried to calm our daughter Karin down and to tell our daughter Karin that it was the Germans – but our daughter Karin knew better. our daughter Karin had after all seen it. From then on You and the other sisters were exposed and lived in constant fear. That lasted until 1943. Then Germany resigned and the Germans had [a] free hand. Many political opponents had managed to escape, were partly in hiding, many were shot. One was now expecting the persecution of the Jews and those people who were working in the Danish Resistance Movement. her husband had already tried every so often in the three previous years to disappear from the scene. her husband was however known throughout Denmark, through lectures at schools, further education colleges, universities and associations in Denmark. Wherever her husband happened to be, it [news of her husband's presence] immediately spread like a wildfire through the town or the village. But now, when it became really serious, her husband thought of a hideout in Denmark. A good friend had once said to her husband [that] in an emergency her husband could rely on her husband's help. A good friend was A good friend. One day her husband was then settled there, but I as a non-Jewish woman had no idea who this emergency helper was. I as a non-Jewish woman wasn’t meant to know anyway. I as a non-Jewish woman could reach her husband through a chain of connections, if necessary. In the meantime we heard again and again from many sources that this or her husband had been picked up by the Danish Resistance Movement, but these were still only single events. It was a very unsettled time. - 3 - When I as a non-Jewish woman came home one afternoon there was a letter from a childhood friend, who as captain of a corvette with the German navy was based outside Denmark and urgently wanted to speak to I as a non-Jewish woman – and indeed had to. We had not seen each other forever for many years, but a childhood friend, who as captain of a corvette with the German navy was based outside Copenhagen and urgently wanted to speak to me – and indeed had to had heard that I as a non-Jewish woman had emigrated to Denmark, also found out I as a non-Jewish woman's current name – and so I as a non-Jewish woman was easy to find in the telephone register. In the letter a childhood friend, who as captain of a corvette with the German navy was based outside Copenhagen and urgently wanted to speak to me – and indeed had to asked I as a non-Jewish woman to make an immediate call to the Hotel Astoria, as a childhood friend, who as captain of a corvette with the German navy was based outside Copenhagen and urgently wanted to speak to me – and indeed had to would have to sail off again very soon. I as a non-Jewish woman was in a state of great agitation and really did not know what to do. Although a childhood friend, who as captain of a corvette with the German navy was based outside Copenhagen and urgently wanted to speak to me – and indeed had to had been here in civvies, to put the letter in our letter box a childhood friend, who as captain of a corvette with the German navy was based outside Copenhagen and urgently wanted to speak to me – and indeed had to, but if a childhood friend, who as captain of a corvette with the German navy was based outside Copenhagen and urgently wanted to speak to me – and indeed had to dared to go into a Jewish house, then I as a non-Jewish woman could also dare [to do this]. After all it had to be something important. As I as a non-Jewish woman was invited an hour later to our good friend Reader Bertelsen, I as a non-Jewish woman decided to discuss everything there. her husband is by now Rector at the Cathedral School in Aarhus. I as a non-Jewish woman can still see today how surprised her husband was and with what interest her husband listened to I as a non-Jewish woman. her husband immediately allowed I as a non-Jewish woman to make a telephone call, even though, as was said, all conversations were tapped. her husband was one of the resistance people after all! I as a non-Jewish woman kept it short and promised to be at the Hotel Astoria the following morning. There I as a non-Jewish woman found out that large-scale persecution of Jews would now take place and her husband advised I as a non-Jewish woman that I as a non-Jewish woman should immediately transfer I as a non-Jewish woman's husband to Sweden. I as a non-Jewish woman had hardly returned home when her husband came and wanted to find out what was so urgent. I as a non-Jewish woman quickly told her husband, her husband jumped up and said: we have to get going immediately and do everything we can to help. I as a non-Jewish woman joined in and helped from one day to the next to build up an organisation and to prepare the ways by which then about 1,200 Jews reached Sweden. Many SS-people and soldiers must have been bribed, otherwise this great campaign would have never succeeded, even if everything happened in the dead of night. There were several more organisations alongside, the political [ones] already existing were strengthened. the political [ones] already existing had already for a long time brought individuals to freedom and I as a non-Jewish woman have to say, very many risked their lives and some of them lost their lives. – There was work to do day and night. Well-meaning and well-off people could be found aplenty. Of course everything had to take place in silence and be carried out without being noticed, and a lot of money was needed. But the number of people who understood what was at stake was great. Students, doctors, professors, police, businesspeople, fishermen, railway staff – everyone contributed where it was needed. Cars were sent out to the most remote areas in Denmark when it was found out that a Jew was still living here or there. Friends provided apartments to sleeping, there [was] good [supply of?] food. Hospitals took in people under false names. - 4 - I as a non-Jewish woman had not been able to sleep in I as a non-Jewish woman's apartment for quite a while, as it had turned out that twice at night gangs of heavily booted German and Danish Nazis wanted to bring us in. Our landlord, who lived on the ground floor of the villa, called in twice at night gangs of heavily booted German and Danish Nazis on the second occasion and questioned twice at night gangs of heavily booted German and Danish Nazis. Our landlord, who lived on the ground floor of the villa said the family Berendsohn had not been in Denmark for a long time. Our landlord, who lived on the ground floor of the villa also asked what the family Berendsohn wanted from Dora Berendsohn, after Dora Berendsohn all Dora Berendsohn was not a Jew. The answer was: if Dora Berendsohn had been married to a Jew for 25 years, Dora Berendsohn is one too. /The landlord too and his wife later had to leave Denmark, I as a non-Jewish woman e quickly disappear, because /The landlord too and his wife were active in the underground movement/ heavily booted German and Danish Nazis avoided daylight, so I as a non-Jewish woman dared to spend a few daytime hours in our apartment. During a few daytime hours too I as a non-Jewish woman was in constant fear, but I as a non-Jewish woman had to be there to be reachable. From near and far people came to I as a non-Jewish woman, strangers, persecuted [people], who had heard I as a non-Jewish woman knew a way to Sweden. In such situations you get to know people. Despair, worry, fear – after all Despair, worry, fear was about life! How did they know I as a non-Jewish woman's name, I as a non-Jewish woman's address? Everything happened like wildfire. It’s only in a situation like that that one gets to know oneself and sees one’s strengths growing at such a time – and the fear disappearing. As an individual I as a non-Jewish woman could do little. The large number of people of goodwill worked together for the fixed goal. I as a non-Jewish woman could only direct those people who came to I as a non-Jewish woman to other addresses, first of all places to stay, because nobody dared to stay in those people who came to me's own apartment anymore. One could get money, consolation and a quick prospect of freedom. There was literally no sleep for days and weeks, one could not, one did not want to, those people who came to me had to be saved first! Friendships for life came out of that. Now I as a non-Jewish woman have to go back, Dear Sister, for in the meantime her husband had been transported to Sweden. One day Frau Dr. S. sent news to us [that] this evening I as a non-Jewish woman's husband was to be at 10 o’clock at the coast at the small train station X, her husband immediately had to go to Sweden. I as a non-Jewish woman tried I as a non-Jewish woman's luck at quickly reaching her husband and then met her husband in the dark at Hellerup station in a small café. We had not seen each other for a long time and we were facing hard times. Whether it would work,- yes, it worked, but only just about, by the skin of our teeth! It was the Danish resistance movement that transported her husband, even before the persecution of Jews set in! A few months later her husband became seriously ill, probably as result of the very difficult flight, of which he her husband has written quite a bit. For several months her husband lay in a critical condition in a sanatorium in Falun high up in the mountains, very prettily situated. the Germans paid for that too, we were still in the Germans's care. - 5 - her husband's courageous host in Denmark was the attack at night in Walter’s courageous host in Denmark's bed very soon after her husband's flight. her husband's wife was Jewish, which her husband did not know. His wife and her husband also had to flee, the daughter stayed with the father and the daughter witnessed the attack. So now many thousands of women, children and men were getting to Sweden within three weeks, through many helpful hands, who again and again were risking many thousands of women, children and men's lives. But one doesn’t think of that, is always obsessed with the idea of helping. Some transports were unfortunately discovered, the people were sent to Germany and Theresienstadt, the people. But nearly all of many thousands of women, children and men by a stroke of luck came back, unlike the Norwegians, from where about 700 Jews, including her husband's relatives all /6/, were sent off to Germany and gassed. That was already in 1942. Only few could save themselves. I as a non-Jewish woman was told that it was time to disappear. The senior doctor of the hospital in which Dora Berendsohn was kept under a false name gave I as a non-Jewish woman a hint, as Dora Berendsohn was sick with anxiety, fear and yearning for the father, of whom Dora Berendsohn knew that the father had long been in safety. So one day I as a non-Jewish woman also had to be ready. I as a non-Jewish woman's wish and I as a non-Jewish woman's last word to her husband, before her husband went off into the unknown, was to save as many Jews as was in I as a non-Jewish woman's powers, was fulfilled, as I as a non-Jewish woman had the great fortune to have her husband as I as a non-Jewish woman's friend. Because of that I as a non-Jewish woman was within a large organisation that did everything that was possible, and had the means to do it. See also her husband book “Oktober 43”, published in Aarhus 1952 in Denmark and in translation also in USA and in Israel. There were now practically no Jews anymore in Denmark, only a few stayed in hiding for the whole years, thanks to caring courageous people who had taken them in. Many helpers finally also had to disappear and so Dora Berendsohn and I as a non-Jewish woman came with one of the last transports in a dramatic way to Trelleborg, a harbour town on the southern point of Sweden. one of the last transports was on 14 October 1943. I as a non-Jewish woman have to add that such transports were attempted along the whole Danish coast and as German patrol boats with torches were out at night, every transport was again a risk. Once again it was doctors, nurses, hospitals, railway staff, students, policemen and civilians who fearlessly led the fight against the Germans. Always endangering doctors, nurses, hospitals, railway staff, students, policemen and civilians who fearlessly led the fight against the Nazis's own lives doctors, nurses, hospitals, railway staff, students, policemen and civilians who fearlessly led the fight against the Nazis took us in very small groups of 3 – 5 people from one place to another, from the car to the train. This time the collection point was a small hotel in southern Denmark, where about 15 endangered - 6 - people came together, including those who wanted to get across Sweden to Sweden, to join this great campaign. In the hotel upstairs on the first floor there was a little hall laid out and to calm our spirits we were served the loveliest dishes. The chef, the waiters, all of them were in the know. From there it continued in three cars, after it had got dark, through a large forest for about an hour to a remote/children’s summer home. It was heated and everything was prepared. There too we had to The wait again for several hours. Again we got sandwiches, tea from thermos flasks. There were about four helpers from the underground movement, who were with us, three students and one nurse. The wait was difficult, but eventually we got the sign to get back into three cars. We drove for half an hour through a large forest, along the coast, to a little fishing harbour. There was our boat. We were stowed one by one in the storage room. There were benches up and it smelled of herring, as usually there was fish stored there. It was nearly dark down there, but we silently put up with everything. The goal was in sight and we hoped for freedom. The eternal hours that followed were incredibly difficult. We had to get around minefields, storms and rain started. Our little nutshell caused us to be thoroughly shaken, and many of us lay on the floor feeling very seasick. There was no toilet. Every one of us was a heap of misery when we looked at each other the following day in the light in Sweden. The feeling of happiness, when long before we were on land the fishermen called down to us: Sweden in sight! was indescribable. We could not have had a warmer welcome from Swedish customs and the police officers. Everything was taken care of, and in a gymnastics hall camping beds had been put up, where we were initially all housed. Boats had also arrived in the previous days and Denmark was full of refugees. The following day everyone was to be transported to a summer hotel in the centre of Denmark, where a refugee camp had been set up. As everybody coming from Denmark was only allowed to carry the absolutely necessities with everybody coming from Denmark, a small hand-carried suitcase of a bag, everybody was clothed and given warm dry stuff. – I as a non-Jewish woman was at the end of I as a non-Jewish woman's strength after weeks of hard and dangerous work and needed to be on I as a non-Jewish woman's own. Therefore I as a non-Jewish woman asked first of all to move into a hotel there on the square with I as a non-Jewish woman's daughter for a short while. As I as a non-Jewish woman had last minute by friends [been given] Swedish money - 7 - that would have worked. I as a non-Jewish woman also had Danish crowns that eventually I as a non-Jewish woman could exchange for Swedish ones. At the police office the police office said that the police office could not make an exception. I as a non-Jewish woman would have also liked to get in touch with Walter, who in the meantime had been given somewhere to stay by her husband's friend Professor Lamm and a job by another friend. The police wanted, as already said, to send I as a non-Jewish woman on the following day, there was no hotel room available, there were conferences and we would have to leave in a closed troop and stay under supervision. I as a non-Jewish woman went back to The police again and this time got hold of the most senior police officer, I as a non-Jewish woman was very lucky. the most senior police officer knew her husband from the most senior police officer's previous lecture tours in southern Sweden, the most senior police officer also knew his friend Professor Lamm. I as a non-Jewish woman immediately got a lovely big room at the city hotel, where Dora Berendsohn and her daughter then stayed for three weeks, before Dora Berendsohn and her daughter could get to Stockholm. There Dora Berendsohn and her daughter finally reunited with her husband and were able to move into a small apartment, which Dora Berendsohn and her daughter got purely by chance. There Dora Berendsohn and her daughter could finally breathe more freely and begin a new life. After all those dark year Dora Berendsohn and her daughter's eyes were now blinded by the illuminated shop windows and advertisements. The way Dora Berendsohn and her daughter enjoyed Dora Berendsohn and her daughter's weeks in Denmark is indescribable. Above all it was light and free around Dora Berendsohn and her daughter! Everything Dora Berendsohn and her daughter had not seen for years was spread out in front of Dora Berendsohn and her daughter in the shops. From Dora Berendsohn and her daughter's hotel window Dora Berendsohn and her daughter saw a beautifully laid-out fruit shop. I as a non-Jewish woman immediately sent Dora Berendsohn down there, Dora Berendsohn was to buy a large bag of the most wonderful things. Dora Berendsohn did a large bag of the most wonderful things with joy and enthusiasm. In the evenings Dora Berendsohn and her daughter talked on the telephone to Walter, who of course was very glad that Dora Berendsohn and her daughter had arrived in Sweden in one piece and healthy, albeit traumatised. Yes, Dear Sister, now Dora Berendsohn and her daughter had arrived in Dora Berendsohn and her daughter's third home. Now, 12 years later, one can say that luck had once again stayed with Dora Berendsohn and her daughter. Dora Berendsohn and her daughter had only had a little suitcase with Dora Berendsohn and her daughter, a tiny one, and only a little money, and nothing to furnish an apartment and to pay for an apartment. Dora Berendsohn and her daughter only had Dora Berendsohn and her daughter's strength, will and the desire to get back to calm circumstances. An apartment was then a highly valued item, and still is now. This time it was Swedish people who helped Dora Berendsohn and her daughter to get going. It all moved forward, even though her husband's serious illness already mentioned above interfered. It was of course a great concern, but it too was dealt with. Progress was made with diligence and great sticking power. After all, you know, what her husband is like when her husband wants to achieve something. I as a non-Jewish woman have often admired her husband, how then, already over 60, her husband again managed to muster - 8 - so much power of resistance, to start anew again. And today, at 72, her husband is still busily working, But in the meantime we have seen each other and talked. What I as a non-Jewish woman have reported today I as a non-Jewish woman wanted to put down in writing, so that you can read it in peace and we can talk about it later.

Shortly afterwards, Geheimrat Demuth took over the leadership of the “Notgemeinschaft deutscher Wissenschaftler im Ausland” (founded by Philip Schwartz, who was then called to Istanbul) in Switzerland. Geheimrat Demuth continued with the leadership of the “Notgemeinschaft deutscher Wissenschaftler im Ausland” (founded by Philip Schwartz, who was then called to Istanbul) when Geheimrat Demuth moved to England in 1936. Geheimrat Demuth got Geheimrat Demuth's certificate of discharge and an indemnification of RM 10.000 in 1934 and is now receiving Geheimrat Demuth's pension. 8.

Someone had warned Geheimrat Demuth that Geheimrat Demuth would be arrested the next day if Geheimrat Demuth did not leave of Geheimrat Demuth's own accord. Geheimrat Demuth had been accused of spreading stories of atrocities as propaganda. With the usual point being made that “The whole thing will just take a few months, but why subject Geheimrat Demuth to all the unpleasantness that will ensue during that time”, Geheimrat Demuth was strongly advised to leave Germany. Geheimrat Demuth left Germany in a sleeping car and had absolutely no trouble at all crossing the Dutch border. The whole process was so easy, in fact, that Geheimrat Demuth assumed that orders must have been issued to allow Geheimrat Demuth to leave freely (?!). Geheimrat Demuth had friendly ties with a number of the foreign embassies in Berlin and a number of the foreign embassies in Berlin very generously put a number of the foreign embassies in Berlin at Geheimrat Demuth's disposal before Geheimrat Demuth left. For example, one member of staff at the French Embassy approached Geheimrat Demuth to pass on regards from Poncet Geheimrat Demuth and to offer the French Embassy's assistance. When Geheimrat Demuth first emigrated, Geheimrat Demuth found Geheimrat Demuth in Switzerland. As soon as Geheimrat Demuth had arrived there, Geheimrat Demuth got involved with the organisation “Notgemeinschaft deutscher Wissenschaftler im Ausland” (Emergency Association of German Scientists Abroad) founded by Professor Philip Schwartz and Geheimrat Demuth soon took over leadership when Professor Philip Schwartz was summoned to Istanbul. the organisation “Notgemeinschaft deutscher Wissenschaftler im Ausland” (Emergency Association of German Scientists Abroad) founded by Professor Philip Schwartz was predominantly active between 1933 and 1939, continuing on a smaller scale up to 1949. Over the years, the organisation “Notgemeinschaft deutscher Wissenschaftler im Ausland” (Emergency Association of German Scientists Abroad) founded by Professor Philip Schwartz managed to achieve a great deal. The rigidity of the regulations in Switzerland made it hard to make progress there, but Mr Braunschweig, the President of the Jewish Committee, was very willing to offer help. Antisemitism was rife in Switzerland and impoverished emigrants were treated horribly. - 2 - Geheimrat Demuth then continued with this work in England from 1936, seamlessly shifting over to work for the Central Joint [illegible] European Committee and the Ministry of Economic Warfare during the war. Geheimrat Demuth interviewed refugees for the Foreign Office who reported to Germany shortly after the outbreak of war (or even later), provided information relating to the pioneers and so on. Geheimrat Demuth worked directly on behalf of the Cabinet and compiled some 5000 reports over the years. In the same period, Geheimrat Demuth focused heavily on getting prisoners released. When asked at what point Geheimrat Demuth first became aware of the danger posed by the Nazi Party and started to take the danger posed by the Nazi Party seriously, Geheimrat Demuth mentioned the following incident: In January 1930 (?), Geheimrat Demuth's colleague Oskar Meyer (Member of the Reichstag [German parliament] and Municipal Councillor) came to his colleague Oskar Meyer (Member of the Reichstag [German parliament] and Municipal Councillor)'s office and explained his colleague Oskar Meyer (Member of the Reichstag [German parliament] and Municipal Councillor)'s view that the situation was intolerable. his colleague Oskar Meyer (Member of the Reichstag [German parliament] and Municipal Councillor) wanted to leave Germany and suggested that they should both go together so that it would be seen as taking a stand. his colleague Oskar Meyer (Member of the Reichstag [German parliament] and Municipal Councillor) did not think that going alone would have any impact. Geheimrat Demuth considered this level of alarm to be excessive and decided not to leave. his colleague Oskar Meyer (Member of the Reichstag [German parliament] and Municipal Councillor) also ended up staying in Germany. Shortly after the following incident, Judicial Councillor Waldschmidt announced that Judicial Councillor Waldschmidt too wanted to get out. Geheimrat Demuth was involved with the central economic organisations and wholesale and retail associations in Germany and Geheimrat Demuth also had ties with the trade unions. The umbrella organisation assembled for regular meetings and there was still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the Nazi Party and the Nazi Party's manifesto within such circles in the same period. Nobody was clear about what the Nazi Party were trying to achieve. On that basis, Funk, who was Editor-in-Chief of the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung newspaper at the time, was invited to attend a meeting so Funk, who was Editor-in-Chief of the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung newspaper at the time could be asked: “As Funk, who was Editor-in-Chief of the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung newspaper at the time know the Nazi Party, can Funk, who was Editor-in-Chief of the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung newspaper at the time tell us what exactly it is the Nazi Party want?” As another, rather typical story from the same period goes: The Chamber of Commerce ran a holiday home in Riga for tradesmen and, before the Nazi Party had even come to power, the people in charge wanted to introduce a - 3 - numerus clausus. Geheimrat Demuth opposed this, but the people in charge found another Member of the Cabinet who was willing to sign the corresponding restrictive regulation. In September the same period, Geheimrat Demuth spoke at the Industry Club in Düsseldorf, where Geheimrat Demuth urged all members to stay firmly in the centre. Geheimrat Demuth said that any other approach would lead to rearmament and warned that a second world war would then be inevitable. Geheimrat Demuth managed to convince Geheimrat Demuth's audience that Geheimrat Demuth's arguments were well-founded with the sole exception of Thyssen, which was to be expected. Judicial Councillor Waldschmidt did also have Judicial Councillor Waldschmidt's own doubts. The purpose of the session was merely to enter into a discussion with a view to clarifying the situation. No vote was held or agreement made. Three weeks later, Hitler spoke in front of the Cabinet for several hours. In the end, Hitler managed to win them all over with the promise that “the Nazi Party would dissolve the trade unions and instead establish state associations.” This was crucial in Hitler's success in getting everyone on Hitler's side. Geheimrat Demuth's view on this now is: “It was a clear victory and everything that came later was undeniably a consequence of a clear victory”. Within the National Industry Association, an umbrella organisation with just ten members, Frowein announced that Frowein had been liaising with the Nazi Party shortly after the Nazi Party came to power. Frowein was the leading intellectual figure within the National Industry Association, an umbrella organisation with just ten members and Frowein gave a speech at this time along the following lines: “We all saw how things progressed after 1918. At first, there was a whole lot of noise about the move towards Socialism and so on. But then it all came to nothing. The exact same will happen this time too. Just don’t be so afraid.” In the summer of 1932, Gelpke, President of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce, had asked Geheimrat Demuth for help on behalf of Geheimrat Demuth's son-in-law, who was in serious financial trouble. Geheimrat Demuth obliged, meaning that Gelpke, President of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce was very much in Gelpke, President of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce's debt. - 4 - Gelpke, President of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce promised that Gelpke, President of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce would support Geheimrat Demuth at all costs. According to Geheimrat Demuth today, this lasted all of five minutes! Geheimrat Demuth received Geheimrat Demuth's certificate of discharge in 1934 and a one-off compensation payment of 10,000 Mark but nothing further. Geheimrat Demuth now receives an adequate pension, which, in Geheimrat Demuth's own words, allows Geheimrat Demuth to live quite comfortably.

47,"[""On 10 November 1938, Mrs W. was arrested by the Mayor of the small town with the hearty approval of a big mob, who demolished Mrs W.'s house. The Warden, The Warden's wife and the bailiff were very kind to Mrs W.. After sixteen days, Mrs W. was released and Mayor Hummel was reprimanded for Mayor Hummel's action. 8. References : ‘Rassenschande’, Amtsgericht Freiberg. The Tenth of November 1938 - Incidents in a small town in the Erzgebirge. The story of Mrs W. can be understood best if a few seemingly unconnected incidents are related first. Mr. and Mrs. W owned a laundry. Mr. and Mrs. W had a partner in a laundry a Sozius, and there was an arrangement that if this method of running a laundry was not to the liking of either party Mr. and Mrs. W could terminate a laundry after a period of five years. In that case a laundry would revert back to Mr. and Mrs. W Yet a partner in it a Sozius had other ideas: a partner in it a Sozius wanted to drive out Mr. and Mrs. W and since a partner in it a Sozius could not do it by fair means a partner in it a Sozius was prepared to do it by foul. a partner in it a Sozius tried to denounce Mrs W. of Mietwucher - overcharging on the rents. a partner in it a Sozius accused Mr. and Mrs. W of being involved in illegal abortions. a partner in it a Sozius also accused Mrs W. of “Rassenschande”. The “Rassenschande-case” went to court and the judge who could see that The “Rassenschande-case” was a put-up job gave judgement in favour of Mr. W. This was at Amtsgericht Freiberg. On the 9th of November Mrs W. and Mrs W.'s son were in England. Still in Germany in the Erzgebirge was Mrs W., and Mrs W.'s parents. Mrs. W, and her parents lived in a nice house there, respected by all. On the 10th of November, unaware of what had happened in Paris in the 9th November, 1938 Mrs W. went to the Rathaus, the townhall to pay some taxes. In the Rathaus, the townhall Mrs W. heard ominous murmering - Volksgemurmel and Mayor Hummel, came up to Mrs W.. - 2 - “Mrs W. are herewith under arrest. Mrs W. are responsible for the murder of Rath.” When Mrs W. tried to speak and explain Mrs W. shouted down “Jude bleibt Jude”, once a Jew always a Jew”. Mrs W. was dragged on to the market square and there from the stairs of the town hall Mayor Hummel delivered a speach. To make sure of a large audience the Rathaus, the townhall had been closed early and the less pleasant people of the small town and some students had assembled to listen. Mayor Hummel was conspicuous by Mayor Hummel's absence. a speach promised the Jews that the Jews would be shown how things would turn. Then with a large audience following Mrs W., Mrs W. was marched off to Mrs W.'s home. There the laundry workers were assembled. The mob - that is what the crowd had turned in to - went into her home breaking things. Mrs W. was asked whether Mrs W. owned any arms. Mrs W. admitted to having a revolver. Mayor Hummel found an airgun from Mrs W.'s son and was very proud of Mrs. W's son's discovery. In the yard Mayor Hummel made another speech in which Mayor Hummel mentioned thigs which Mayor Hummel could have learned only from the Sozius. A big pile was made of “forbidden literature” and other books and also old bibles which Mrs W. had been collecting over years. A big pile were burned. Other valuable things lost during this morning was jewelery from Mrs W.'s mother and Mrs W.'s daughter. While some of the people who went into her home were causing a havoc inside others threw stones through the window. Yet some of the people who went into her home were different. some of the people who went into the house hid things which some of the people who went into the house thought had sentimental value. some of the people who went into the house hid things which they thought had sentimental value beneath beds. - 3 - At about six o'clock that evening when Mrs W. had just had time to clear up a little after The mob - that is what the crowd had turned in to - had left Mayor Hummel arrived with the gun. When Mrs W. said that Mrs W. had always admitted to having the gun Mayor Hummel shouted: “Shut Mrs W.'s dirty mouth” (Halten Sie Mrs W. ungewaschenes Mrs W.) At seven o'clock the police arrived to take Mrs W. into protective custody. Mayor Hummel was most curtious, asked who would look after the canary and when The mob - that is what the crowd had turned in to - were in the street the offer to walk ahead so that it did not look too much like an arrest. Mrs W. declined the offer. Mrs W.'s remarks to Mayor Hummel's offer were: “If anybody has to be ashamed at this moment, it should be Mrs W..” Mrs W. spent 16 days in jail. It was the Amtsgefängnis. The warden and The warden's wife were very kind to Mrs W.. On Sunday Mrs W. was visited by Mayor Hummel and was most upset at Mrs W.'s fate. Mrs W. worked in jail trimming feathers. Mrs W.'s brother came from Paris on the 10th November. Mrs. W's son had to carry Mrs. W's son's radio, a Telefunken, into the Schützenhaus and Mrs. W's son had a screaming mob follow Mrs. W's son. Mrs. W's son got back safely, though, from delivering his radio, a Telefunken, but was the arrest later that night and sent into concentration-camp. Mrs W. feels that Mrs W.'s affair would not have happened if the Amtshauptmann, a senior official, had not been on leave. As soon as Mrs. W's son returned Mrs W. was released. - 4 - Mayor Hummel was reprimanded over Mayor Hummel's action - in privet - but the news leaked out. To justify Mayor Hummel Mayor Hummel said that letters were exchanged between members of the W. family in which members of the W. family said that the Nazis were like a comet on the sky and that the Nazis would disappear in the same way. This provoking letter was found only much later than the incident had taken place. The fact that Mayor Hummel had to justify Mayor Hummel at all is most interesting. Among the people who lived in the small town were many kind folk. The warden in jail was kind to Mrs W. and was concerned when The warden learned that Mrs W.'s brother had been taken to jail. The warden said to Mrs W. on the morning after the arrest: “How did Mrs W. sleep. We could not sleep all night and just sat up smoking cigarettes all the time.” The warden collected toys for the children of a Russian prisoner shortly before a Russian prisoner's release at Christmas. The warden also phoned Mrs W. after Mrs W.'s release to ask Mrs W. how Mrs W. was. And yet there had been a screaming mob. And neither Mayor Hummel nor Mayor Hummel can claim for the Bürgermeister nor the Sozius the excuse, if it is one, that the Bürgermeister nor the Sozius were only ignorant people momentarily fooled. the Bürgermeister nor the Sozius were deliberately malicious. the small town!

48,"['A report on the murder of Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner, Chemnitz, April 1933. After Kristallnacht, Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner was taken to the police-prison, where Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner caught sight of Rabbi Dr. Fuchs whose face was full of blood. With the help of an “Aryan” doctor, Rabbi Dr. Fuchs whose face was full of blood got into the Hospital and could avoid Buchenwald, where to all the other Jewish men from Chemnitz were deported. Atrocities at the arrival. Interview with Mr and Mrs David Flieg, London On the day of the 1933 boycott, the chairman of the local branch of the R.j.F., Jurist Dr. Weiner, was collected from Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner's house. Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner had set up an alarm for the police. Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner's wife asked Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner if His wife should set off an alarm, to which Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner said no. Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner went to Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner's desk and took out Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner's officers-patent and thought that this would keep Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner safe, because Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner took an alarm with Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner. Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner was put in a car which drove through a forest. Here, Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner is supposed to have been told to get out and walk into a forest, which Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner also did. And then Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner was shot in the back and killed. On the day of the 1938 pogrom, Herr. Flieg, in Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner's villa on the outskirts of Schönau, lay in bed with heart troubles and was arrested from there. Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner was taken to the police prison. Here, in a corridor, Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner saw Rabbi Dr. Fuchs whose face was full of blood. Yet because of this, Rabbi Dr. Fuchs whose face was full of blood did not end up in a K.Z. An ‘Aryan’ doctor saw to it that Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner was admitted to a hospital in Chemitz and out of humanity exaggerated An ‘Aryan’ doctor's descriptions of the wounds, so that Rabbi Dr. Fuchs whose face was full of blood could stay in a hospital in Chemitz. All the other Jewish men in Chemitz were taken to Buchenwald, where to all the other Jewish men from Chemnitz were deported. Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner's brother in law, Jurist Hartmann, with the impression of the famous and terrible march in Buchenwald, where to all the other Jewish men from Chemnitz were deported in mind, wanted to persuade Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner to commit suicide together. Jurist Hartmann was chairman of the Saxonia – Loge B.B and was prominent in Jewish life there. Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner calmed Jurist Hartmann and rejected suicide, as His brother in law, Jurist Hartmann realised. A man from Chemitz was beaten to death in a bunker in Buchenwald, where to all the other Jewish men from Chemnitz were deported, another by the name of ‘teinhard’ died after another by the name of ‘teinhard’'s release, as was the case with a man named ‘Grünberg’ who had bladder troubles. On the march Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner helped the severely war-wounded Wangenheim from the lorry, in which they were brought to the camp. In doing so W. was so severely injured that W. collapsed, covered in blood. In spite of this Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner made it known that W. was war-wounded. Rechtsanwalt Dr. Weiner had sustained a severe head injury. A man from Chemitz was mentally disabled. A certain Simon was only able to save A man from Chemitz by laying A man from Chemitz among the plies of dead. A certain Simon lives still. In Chemitz the window panes of all the shops were destroyed. In the district of Ober-Wuchwitz a house was destroyed. In the Villa Fliegschen in the district of Schönau a pane of glass was destroyed. The officials of the responsible police station, Siegmar, were very humane and watched over the Jewish houses after this. In the warehouse Schocken large damages were perpetrated. The perpetrators had obviously not known that that the warehouse Schocken had just been bought by a British corporation. This is later said to have received compensation. Already in Buchenwald, where to all the other Jewish men from Chemnitz were deported myself, the affair was related to me by Dr. Curt Cohn, then a member of the Regional Court and now a member of the Supreme Court of the DDR in Berlin.

49,"[""Mrs M. van Iperen was a Dutch Christian and was manageress of a grocer's shop in Amsterdam. On the outbreak of the war Mrs M. van Iperen joined the Resistance. The account describes in detail Mrs M. van Iperen's various activities. Mrs M. van Iperen also participated actively in the strike of Dutch workers in sympathy with the Jews. In October 1942 the SS came to Mrs M. van Iperen's house. Mrs M. van Iperen had built a hiding place for all incriminating material and succeeded in stowing everything away before the men, led by Lages chief of SD, forced the men, led by Lages chief of SD's way in. Mrs M. van Iperen and 3 friends were arrested. Mrs M. van Iperen and 3 friends had been denounced by one of Mrs M. van Iperen and 3 friends's colleagues who had been caught. The Gestapo never found a hiding place for all incriminating material, and throughout the interrogations at Euterpestraat Mrs M. van Iperen never confessed anything. At first Mrs M. van Iperen was in Amstellveenscheweg prison, but after the fifth unsuccessful questioning Mrs M. van Iperen was taken to a coffin-like cell in Weterino Schans prison and confronted with the informer. Mrs M. van Iperen still denied everything and was taken to a punishment cell in Amstellveenscheweg in complete darkness by day and glaring lights at night. After 4 days Mrs M. van Iperen could return to Mrs M. van Iperen's old cell, and the interrogations continued. In January 1943 Mrs M. van Iperen was allowed to work, and this enabled Mrs M. van Iperen to disseminate news and letters among her fellow-prisoners. Twice Mrs M. van Iperen was denounced for these activities and was eventually sent to Vught in June 1943. Here Mrs M. van Iperen had to work for Philips. In February 1944 there was a tragic incident: As a result of a denunciation by a German prisoner, Mrs Jedzini, a fight broke out amongst the women, in the course of which a German prisoner, Mrs Jedzini was shot by a guard. the women were locked overnight in a tiny prison cell and 15 of the women suffocated. In September 1944 the prisoners could hear the guns firing, and on 7 September Vught was evacuated. Mrs M. van Iperen travelled for days in a cattle truck, without food, or water or lavatory. On arrival in Ravensbrück they had to stand for 2 days and nights out of doors. Then they had to exchange their clothes for dirty, verminous rags, no shoes or knickers. Their barrack was built for 300 but housed 1,600. 11 women shared a mattress in three-tiered bunkers. Out of 5 lavatories only one worked. Mrs M. van Iperen had to work for Philips for 12 hours per day. Mrs M. van Iperen worked in the “Nickelei”, where parts of aeroplanes were chromium-plated. The acid in the material corroded The workers's clothing, and the air became poisoned. The workers, therefore, received an extra ration of half a pint of milk. The workers's lunch consisted of half a pint of warm water with potato peels or turnips. Towards the end of the war work for Philips stopped and Mrs M. van Iperen returned to the general camp. In order to escape work in the quarry Mrs M. van Iperen hid behind a loose board in the ceiling above the bed of Mrs M. van Iperen's friend, Hilde Sternberg. Via Sweden Mrs M. van Iperen returned to Holland, but Mrs M. van Iperen's sufferings have left Mrs M. van Iperen a very ill person. 10. Further References : Riek Suel and Jo Elsendoorn, fellow prisoners in police car. De Groot, Jewish fellow prisoner in Amstelveenscheweg prison, for whom Mrs M. van Iperen smuggled a letter out of prison. See also account by Hilde Sternberg P.Ill.h. (Ravensbrück) No. 823 for further information. Work and Sufferings of a Non-Jewess Mrs M. van Iperen is Dutch by birth and lived at one time in Amsterdam, where Mrs M. van Iperen worked as the manageress of a grocer’s shop. Mrs M. van Iperen is a non-Jew. Immediately after the outbreak of the war, Mrs M. van Iperen became involved with an “illegal“ group, part of the Dutch Resistance movement. Mrs M. van Iperen first came into contact with an “illegal“ group, part of the Dutch Resistance movement through Mrs M. van Iperen's work at a grocer’s shop. Mrs M. van Iperen sold pamphlets and used the money raised to help those who were in hiding. those who were in hiding included not only Jews, but also anyone holding left-wing political views. Mrs M. van Iperen was also able to provide an “illegal“ group, part of the Dutch Resistance movement with extra food rations. Mrs M. van Iperen became a member of the Dutch Resistance movement in December 1940 and started to shop for the Jews in Mrs M. van Iperen's lunch break, as the Jews were not allowed to do so the Jews during normal shop hours. the Jews then started coming to Mrs M. van Iperen to pick up the Jews's parcels. During the night Mrs M. van Iperen used to go out into the street and stick up anti-Nazi posters. A curfew was in place between one and five o’clock in the morning, during which time she too was not allowed to be out on the streets. Mrs M. van Iperen also operated a courier service, delivering letters from one individual to another. Mrs M. van Iperen collected money from addresses given to Mrs M. van Iperen, cash to be used to help those in hiding. Mrs M. van Iperen even went to pick up incendiary bombs, which Mrs M. van Iperen then delivered to another part of town. Someone always accompanied Mrs M. van Iperen on these missions to make sure there were no accidents en route. The recipients would then place incendiary bombs, which she then delivered to another part of town where incendiary bombs, which she then delivered to another part of town would destroy valuable German materials. Mrs M. van Iperen was then instructed to learn shorthand and typing. During the night it was Mrs M. van Iperen's task to transcribe text onto wax plates for use in printing “illegal” newspapers. plates for use in printing “illegal” newspapers had to be bought out of Mrs M. van Iperen's own money. Other members of the Dutch Resistance movement would come to collect “illegal” newspapers and then - 2 - distribute “illegal” newspapers to smaller outlets from where “illegal” newspapers were sold. Mrs M. van Iperen continued with this work every night and on Sundays. Mrs M. van Iperen had a free evening once a week, and a Sunday off every fortnight. If something particular happened and extra duties were required, Mrs M. van Iperen gave freely of Mrs M. van Iperen's time. Sometimes Mrs M. van Iperen worked until 4, 5 or even 8 o’clock in the morning. One of Mrs M. van Iperen's tasks was to grind sugar into a fine powder which was then used to make incendiary bombs. The resistance workers decreed that everyone should wear a yellow star, including Christians. a yellow star, including Christians was then retracted for fear that the Germans would arrest Christians in reprisal, and that would put an end to the work The resistance workers were doing. It was also felt that having everyone wear the yellow Star of David armband would, in fact, do little to help the Jews. Interested parties came to Mrs M. van Iperen's shop to buy “illegal“ newspapers. At this time people knew the bare minimum about each other; one man was unlikely to know the identity of another man, or anything else about one man. Anti-Jewish measures were becoming more and more stringent. Mrs M. van Iperen saved up food to give to the Jews. Mrs M. van Iperen's workplace was in the north of Amsterdam, where she worked as the manageress of a grocer’s shop. In February 1942, workers from the Fokker plant and other factories came to Mrs M. van Iperen, among many others, warning workers from the Fokker plant and other factories to stock up on food supplies and go home early. workers from the Fokker plant and other factories were about to stage a strike to oppose the anti-Jewish measures that were being enacted. The last ferry into the centre of the city, where workers from the Fokker plant and other factories lived, left at two o’clock. All the shops were shut. Almost the entire province of Nordholland was involved in the protest. The tram drivers‘ aim was to cause major disruption on the street called the “Munt”, and Mrs M. van Iperen was involved in The tram drivers‘ aim. Afterwards, the strikers all went home to lie low for a few days. The whole time a strike was going on, the Germans marched through the streets armed with bayonets and guns. If anyone dared come to the window to look out, the Germans immediately shot at them. After three days, the strike - intended simply as a demonstration of support for the Jews - was over. - 3 - The work of the Dutch Resistance movement continued. Mrs M. van Iperen was now involved solely with the production of posters and newspapers. The identities of those who came to collect posters and newspapers were kept secret, but each had a codeword by which those who came to collect the newspapers could be recognised. Those who came regularly were easily recognised by sight, but no-one ever knew their names. It was just too dangerous knowing too much about other people while doing the production of posters and newspapers, and could have led to all kinds of trouble. If ever a member of the Dutch Resistance movement was arrested, all incriminating material had to be burnt and work ceased for a day or two, so as not to endanger anyone else. This never happened in the group that Mrs M. van Iperen belonged to. Mrs M. van Iperen's work continued night after night. In October 1942, the doorbell rang in the middle of the night at Mrs van I’s flat in Keizersgracht, where The work of the underground movement was being carried out. On seeing German and Dutch the SS soldiers outside, German and Dutch SS soldiers refused to open the door but instead set about burning all the “illegal“ material in the oven. There was a built-in hiding-place in the wall where stencil machines, cardboard, oil and explosive substances were kept. After 45 minutes, the Germans had managed to get through the neighbouring garden and flat and into the Germans's house, breaking the door down to gain entry. The head of the security services The head of the security services himself, a man by the name of Lages, a man by the name of Lages, arrested the Germans; there was no chance to hide because the roof, the garden and their house were all surrounded by SS men. All three of the women there were taken away. the SS stayed in their house for five days and nights hoping to catch more perpetrators, but no-one came. the SS went right through their house, searching every nook and cranny and ripping up the floor, but found nothing. the SS completely missed a built-in hiding-place in the wall where stencil machines, cardboard, oil and explosive substances were kept, and when Mrs M. van Iperen returned home after the outbreak of the war Mrs M. van Iperen found the materials and equipment still there, untouched. The reason the SS spent so much time searching the premises was because the SS were convinced a built-in hiding-place in the wall where stencil machines, cardboard, oil and explosive substances were kept was the place where “illegal“ communications were being produced. A man who had come regularly to collect newspapers from Mrs M. van Iperen, which he used to distribute on trains travelling into Germany, had been captured by the Germans and interrogated. He had denounced all 29 members of the Dutch Resistance movement which was why suspicion had fallen on their house. When the SS failed to find anything incriminating, the SS assumed the premises had just been used as some kind of halfway house. All three of the women there were taken away by car, with an armed the SS guard, to the security service’s headquarters in Ravensbrück. A woman called Mrs Riek Suel and a man called Mr Jo Elsendoorn were in the same car, both - 4 - accused of buying the “illegal“ newspaper. That night A woman called Mrs Riek Suel and a man called Mr Jo Elsendoorn were put into individual cells at Ravensbrück. The following day, the interrogation began; nobody confessed to anything. A woman called Mrs Riek Suel and a man called Mr Jo Elsendoorn were then taken to Amstelveensche Weg prison and locked in individual cells at Euterpestrasse. A woman called Mrs Riek Suel and a man called Mr Jo Elsendoorn stayed there until the end of June 1943. During this period A woman called Mrs Riek Suel and a man called Mr Jo Elsendoorn were interrogated eight times. eight times always took place in Ravensbrück. The fourth time Mrs M. van Iperen was questioned, Lages showed Mrs M. van Iperen a stencil machine and said: “Lages found this in Mrs M. van Iperen's flat”. Mrs M. van Iperen immediately recognised a stencil machine as Mrs M. van Iperen, but a stencil machine was one that Mrs M. van Iperen hadn’t used for some time and had given away. Mrs M. van Iperen and the two other women stuck firmly to She and the two other women's statement that this could not have been found in She and the two other women's flat. So adamant were She and the two other women in She and the two other women's testimony that the SS ended up believing that in fact no printing had taken place in She and the two other women's flat, but that their house had merely been used as a halfway house. Had She and the two other women not believed this, All three of the women there would have been shot right there and then. For the fifth interrogation, Mrs M. van Iperen was taken to Wetering Schans prison, escorted there by a special division. On arrival Mrs M. van Iperen was put into a wooden lock-up resembling an upright coffin. They then brought Mrs M. van Iperen's face to face with the man who had betrayed Mrs M. van Iperen. the interrogation lasted a whole day. When asked “Do Mrs M. van Iperen know Lages?” Mrs M. van Iperen's reply was always “No“. The informer, however, maintained that The informer knew Mrs M. van Iperen and again told in detail of the illegal work in which Mrs M. van Iperen had been involved. But Mrs M. van Iperen remained steadfast and confessed nothing. Mrs M. van Iperen was taken back to Amstelveensche Weg prison, but was not locked up with the two other women. Instead Mrs M. van Iperen was put in a punishment cell – a two and a half metre square “barred cage“ down in a built-in hiding-place in the wall where stencil machines, cardboard, oil and explosive substances were kept. There were even bars above Mrs M. van Iperen's head. The only furniture in a built-in hiding-place in the wall where stencil machines, cardboard, oil and explosive substances were kept was a wooden plank bed. Mrs M. van Iperen was forced to hand over Mrs M. van Iperen's jacket and long trousers. Mrs M. van Iperen sat there in pitch darkness all day long, and then at night under glaringly bright lights. Mrs M. van Iperen was given a sack of straw to sleep on, but no blanket to cover Mrs M. van Iperen and was unable to sleep anyway because of glaringly bright lights. Marking time by the church clock, Mrs M. van Iperen walked round and round a built-in hiding-place in the wall where stencil machines, cardboard, oil and explosive substances were kept, changing direction every half an hour. Mrs M. van Iperen spent three days and nights incarcerated there, just walking round and round. - 5 - On the fourth day the SS men brought Mrs M. van Iperen back to Ravensbrück. Yet again Mrs M. van Iperen was asked if Mrs M. van Iperen knew the informer. Mrs M. van Iperen repeatedly denied that Mrs M. van Iperen did. the SS men threatened to shoot Mrs M. van Iperen; still Mrs M. van Iperen confessed nothing. As the SS men already had Mrs M. van Iperen imprisoned, Mrs M. van Iperen felt emboldened to say to the SS men: “Mrs M. van Iperen’re never going to win the outbreak of the war, Mrs M. van Iperen know“. Mrs M. van Iperen was then taken back to Mrs M. van Iperen's old cell in Amstelveensche Weg prison. In subsequent interrogations, too, Mrs M. van Iperen was asked repeatedly whether Mrs M. van Iperen knew the informer or the informer, but the SS men's questioning was pointless as Mrs M. van Iperen steadfastly refused to reveal anything. One of the Dutch SS men tried to get Mrs M. van Iperen to talk by putting all the blame on the Jews. Of course, that didn‘t work either. In January 1943, Mrs M. van Iperen was given more freedom and was allowed out to clean the prison corridors and distribute food. Mrs M. van Iperen's cell was not locked during the day, only at night-time. This meant Mrs M. van Iperen was able to go into the other cells. Amongst the other inmates there were a large number of students who had been caught distributing ration cards stolen from the local registration office. When prisoners returned in the evening after being interrogated, prisoners would write down any news or information prisoners had gleaned during the day on small pieces of paper and Mrs M. van Iperen would take any news or information they had gleaned during the day on small pieces of paper from cell to cell, so that people were kept abreast of anything new. Mrs M. van Iperen also passed letters to the prisoners through the hatch in the prisoners's door. Then someone betrayed Mrs M. van Iperen and Mrs M. van Iperen was summoned to the camp commandant for questioning. Mrs M. van Iperen never told the camp commandant where letters had come from, claiming Mrs M. van Iperen had found letters under a mat. As nothing could be proved, Mrs M. van Iperen was allowed to go. A Jew by the name of de Groot asked Mrs M. van Iperen to smuggle a letter out to A Jew by the name of de Groot's family. A Jew by the name of de Groot wanted to warn his family that his family were in danger and should take his family's weapons and “go into hiding“. Mrs M. van Iperen promised to take a letter. Every fortnight families were allowed to come and collect the prisoners dirty linen and clothing for washing. So it was that Mrs M. van Iperen managed to smuggle a letter through, despite the bundle of washing being searched by a female prison guard. Mrs M. van Iperen would sew letters into the seams, hems and shoulder pads of laundry items. Once again Mrs M. van Iperen was betrayed – this time by Mrs M. van Iperen's Christian cellmates. - 6 - A further interrogation was carried out. Once again Mrs M. van Iperen was sent to the punishment barracks for a day. Mrs M. van Iperen continued to deny everything and, as it was impossible to prove Mrs M. van Iperen ‘crime‘, Mrs M. van Iperen was released. The others involved were saved as a result. During the night, Jews were transported to Wetering Schans prison. It was Mrs M. van Iperen job to leave the bags that these people were going to take with Jews outside these people's doors. One of the women, who was to be deported, gave Mrs M. van Iperen's 10 guilders as a thank-you gift as Mrs M. van Iperen left. At the start of June 1943, the prison was so crowded that many of the inmates were sent to Wetering Schans prison. Once the camp commandant realised the camp commandant were not going to get any new information out of Mrs M. van Iperen, she too was sent to Wetering Schans prison. There were some people, very few of them Christian, who accepted huge sums of money for hiding Jews. For them it was a good way to make some cash. But if they got caught, they complained bitterly about getting locked up for helping “filthy Jews“. Mrs M. van Iperen's number at Wetering Schans prison was l67. While there, Mrs M. van Iperen worked in the Fokker plant. Of the civilan workforce by no means all were Nazis. Many offered their help, for example by smuggling letters to them from Westerbork - even those that had to be taken to Amsterdam prison. While in Wetering Schans prison the Christians also received parcels from both the Christians's relatives and the Red Cross. The Jews were allowed neither. Mrs M. van Iperen recalls a tragic event that took place in February 1944. Two women were standing out on the parade ground – one of Two women was Mrs Jedzini, a German prisoner with definite Nazi sympathies, and the other a Dutch woman. the other a Dutch woman was telling everyone that Mrs Jedzini’s had managed to carry on working illegally and hiding Jews. Quite by chance the other a Dutch woman was then released that same day, whereupon Mrs Jedzini – no-one knew why Mrs Jedzini’s had originally been arrested – went straight to the camp commandant to complain about the fact that she, a German, had not been released, while someone who was still hiding Jews had been allowed to go home. - 7 - Mrs Jedzini’s behaviour enraged the two other women; the two other women beat Mrs Jedzini’s and refused to let Mrs Jedzini’s sleep in the barracks that night. Mrs Jedzini’s used this ill-treatment to Mrs Jedzini’s's advantage and complained to the camp commandant the following day. The other prisoners were at work in the Fokker plant until the evening, except for one girl. In retaliation for the way Mrs Jedzini’s had been treated, Mrs Jedzini’s this incident off one girl's hair. Once again Mrs Jedzini’s used this incident to complain to the camp commandant. After that, the other inmates hurled such violent abuse at Mrs Jedzini’s that Mrs Jedzini’s feared for Mrs Jedzini’s's life and tried to escape. Mrs Jedzini’s ran to the barbed wire fence and was shot by one of the guards. The bullet pierced Mrs Jedzini’s's lung and Mrs Jedzini’s died in hospital a few days later. That afternoon Mrs Jedzini’s was sent to the Bunker, as the prison block at Wetering Schans prison was known. There Mrs Jedzini’s was questioned about which of The other prisoners had been involved in ill-treating Mrs Jedzini’s; Mrs Jedzini’s said nothing. The whole block came forward en masse to say that they had all been involved in what had happened. The result was that All three of the women there were taken to Wetering Schans prison and put into one cell, measuring just two by three metres. Wetering Schans prison had only recently been built. The walls, and the nitric acid that had been used during Wetering Schans prison's construction, were not yet dry. The windows could not be opened. All three of the women there were so tightly crammed together that All three of the women there's oxygen supply was soon depleted. As the vapour rose from All three of the women there's bodies, so nitric acid dripped down on All three of the women there, burning the skin on All three of the women there's faces, heads and bodies. When the chief prison guard - a German woman - opened one cell, measuring just two by three metres the following morning, the cloud of vapour that issued forth was so great that the chief prison guard - a German woman - slammed the door shut again and went to fetch the chief prison guard - a German woman -. When they both returned All three of the women there were released, having spent from 6pm the previous evening until 8am that morning confined in the parade ground. Fifteen of All three of the women there had died, others had fainted. Mrs M. van Iperen tried to revive All three of the women there with artificial respiration. An SS doctor was called. An SS doctor followed An SS doctor's instincts as a doctor rather than as a good Nazi, and tried to help All three of the women there by adminis- - 8 - tering injections. All three of the women there were now taken to other cells in Wetering Schans prison, this time no more than 2 or 3 prisoners to a cell. All three of the women there were given food; and straw to sleep on. After four days All three of the women there were forced to testify that All three of the women there were guilty of mutiny; this was All three of the women there's only chance of being released. All three of the women there were taken back to the barracks under cover of darkness, so that no-one could see what sort of state All three of the women there were in. That same day An SS doctor flew back to Amsterdam and reported the camp commandant; a few days later, the camp commandant was sent to the Eastern Front. one girl was kept in prison, and there one girl stayed until June 1944. Accused of fomenting the disturbances, one girl was then returned to the general camp for a couple of days before being sent to Ravensbrück. Mrs M. van Iperen was not the only one driven to collapse by these terrible events, and was hospitalised for a fortnight. Even today, one girl's ability to work is severely hampered as a result of this and other wartime experiences. All three of the women there continued working in the Philips workshop. In September 1944, further transports of Jewish prisoners arrived in Vught from other camps. The rumble of cannonfire could be heard in the distance and Dutch Nazis were fleeing to Germany with Dutch Nazis's families. On 5 September, many of the younger prisoners were shot as political criminals. On 6 September, Wetering Schans prison was evacuated. Prisoners were allowed to take two blankets and some food with Prisoners. Mrs M. van Iperen was loaded into a cattle truck along with All three of the women there. As All three of the women there travelled through Amsterdam, the doors were opened at each station and All three of the women there were given water. Once All three of the women there reached the German border the doors remained closed; All three of the women there were given nothing more to eat or drink and were given no access to toilet facilities. All three of the women there travelled like this for two days and nights. On 9 September All three of the women there arrived in Fürstenberg; from Fürstenberg All three of the women there had to walk to Ravensbrück. On arrival, All three of the women there were made to stand out in the open for a further two days and nights. The only food All three of the women there had during a further two days and nights was any bread All three of the women there had left - 9 - over from the train journey. All three of the women there were given nothing else to eat or drink. As the floor of the general camp was covered with coal dust, it wasn’t long before All three of the women there were completely black, including All three of the women there's eyes. coal dust caused many of All three of the women there to contract TB. At the end of a further two days and nights, All three of the women there were registered and given numbers – Mrs M. van Iperen was 76,969. Mrs M. van Iperen was registered during the night and then taken to the washhouse, where all Mrs M. van Iperen's clothes were removed. In return Mrs M. van Iperen was given a lice-infested vest and a thin dress – not a prison dress but an ordinary civilian dress with a cross sewn on the back. Mrs M. van Iperen was given neither shoes nor underclothes. On the rare occasions when the showers worked, the water came out ice-cold. In the dormitory barracks All three of the women there had to share a bed that was only really big enough for three. All three of the women there had only a layer of wood shavings as a mattress and these too were crawling with lice. All three of the women there slept in three-tiered bunks. the general camp was infested with vermin. Mrs M. van Iperen stayed here until the end of April; throughout the end of April Mrs M. van Iperen was given neither soap, a towel nor fresh clothing. One of All three of the women there gave Mrs M. van Iperen some old underwear and 2 odd socks. After a week, the “Philips people“ were selected to go and work for Philips. The working day ran from 7am to 7pm, with 45 minutes for lunch. the “Philips people“'s food ration consisted of half a litre of hot water with potato peelings, or water with caraway seeds or turnips. the “Philips people“ were taken out in columns to exercise. The barracks that Mrs M. van Iperen occupied was designed for 300 people, but actually accommodated All three of the women there. Of the five toilets, only one worked. So the “Philips people“ were forced to ‘do the “Philips people“'s business‘ outside the dormitory barracks, which meant people had to walk through the mess. The prison guards often came at 2 o’clock in the morning and beat All three of the women there with long leather whips. All three of the women there were then made to stand out on the parade ground until 7 o’clock in the morning, even in snow and rain. Not having any shoes, Mrs M. van Iperen improvised by tying two pieces of wood to Mrs M. van Iperen's feet with cord. Mrs M. van Iperen worked in the “Nickelei“ department at Philips, chromium plating aircraft parts. The atmosphere was toxic, so - 10 - they were given an extra ration of half a litre of milk per day. Mrs M. van Iperen gave All three of the women there to a woman who was very severely malnourished. The acid in the material they were working with corroded their clothing and before long their clothing was full of holes. In January 1945 the temperature had dropped to minus 28 degrees. Mrs M. van Iperen managed to get Mrs M. van Iperen's hands on a pullover in exchange for four slices of bread. There was no ‘pulling-together‘ among the prisoners. People didn’t help each other, everything had to be bought. Towards the end of the outbreak of the war, the work at Philips came to an end and Mrs M. van Iperen returned to the general camp. Knowing the physical toll it took on All three of the women there, Mrs M. van Iperen had no desire to be sent to work at Wetering Schans prison. Mrs M. van Iperen managed to avoid it by “hiding in Mrs M. van Iperen's friend Hilde Sternberg’s bed”. Mrs M. van Iperen turned up at the roll-call and was counted. But then a bit later, when All three of the women there were being lined up ready to go to work, Mrs M. van Iperen found a better hiding-place. her friend Hilde Sternberg’s slept in the top bunk and one of the planks in the ceiling above her friend Hilde Sternberg’s bed had come loose. Mrs M. van Iperen crawled inside whenever the guard came along and started lashing the empty beds with Mrs M. van Iperen's whip to see if anyone was hiding there. From Ravensbrück, Mrs M. van Iperen returned home to Holland via Sweden. Having shared the final part of Mrs M. van Iperen's ordeal and endured the same experiences as her friend Hilde Sternberg’s, Mrs M. van Iperen recommends that people also read Mrs M. van Iperen's friend’s account of the events described here. Mrs van I., who now lives in Amsterdam, where she worked as the manageress of a grocer’s shop, was very sick for two full years following the end of the outbreak of the war.

 to take the later train,"['The author lived in Berlin throughout the Hitler period, hidden by Gräfin von Maltzan whom The author later married. The author's mother was deported to Theresienstadt in the same year. His mother died later in the same year at Auschwitz. His mother was well-known in the circles of the underground movement. His mother helped organising the escape of sixty Jews to Scandinavia. His mother gave a number of people asylum in His mother's tiny flat. His mother was denounced at one time by a Mrs Milan. The Jewish Gestapo agent Isaacsohn and The Jewish Gestapo agent Isaacsohn's wife Stella Goldschlag-Kuebler were concerned in this incident. His mother was kept under close watch by the Gestapo until a Mr Hoffmann, a high-ranking police officer went to His mother's assistance. During the last days of the war His mother also offered hospitality to a great number of deserters from the German Forces. “Illegal Life” in Berlin At the time when Hitler rose to power, The author was still employed in a leading role in commerce. The author was permitted to pursue The author's profession without any constraints up until 1938. The author's contract was terminated without notice in November 1938. The author's emigration to England, which The author had planned jointly with The author's mother, ran into considerable difficulties, mostly due to unforeseen personal circumstances. Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I therefore had to remain in Berlin. In 1939, The author undertook a retraining course in metal analysis, and then worked in the laboratories of a certain Dr Lewin. Dr Lewin, a leading authority in the field of metal analysis, was forced to close a certain Dr Lewin's laboratories in 1940 because of a certain Dr Lewin's racial background. In 1941, The author came down with polymeritis. At the same time, The author was affected by one of the “catastrophic evictions”. Back then, all houses that ceased to be in the possession of all houses that ceased to be in the possession of their Jewish owners from a certain closing date onwards's Jewish owners from a certain closing date onwards would need to immediately be cleared of all of all houses that ceased to be in the possession of their Jewish owners from a certain closing date onwards's remaining Jewish residents as well. The eviction notes were distributed by Jewish congregations, at the direct orders of the Nazis. Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I then received an apartment on the premises of a Jewish landlord on Konstanzerstraße. In the same year, a chain of unfortunate events led to the deportation of The author's mother - 2 - to Theresienstadt. The pretext for The author's mother’s deportation was that the Star of David on my mother - 2 -'s chest had been covered in parts by my mother - 2 -'s fur boa. In September 1942, The author's mother was forced to conclude my mother - 2 -'s life in Auschwitz. All these events eventually persuaded The author to go underground. The author moved in with The author's “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became The author's wife. At this time, my “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became my wife still occupied a small two-bedroom apartment built into a former ground floor shop on Detmolderstraße. my “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became my wife was not an unknown figure in the underground movement. Although my “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became my wife was a Protestant, my “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became my wife had become the closest confidante and associate of Father Muckermann in Munich. There, my “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became my wife also obtained a Ph.D. in the natural sciences. When my “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became my wife began to feel the heat in Munich, my “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became my wife left Munich for Berlin. In Berlin, in 1939, my “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became my wife was conscripted into the ranks of the Foreign Ministry, mostly because of my “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became my wife's excellent command of several foreign languages. Shortly thereafter my “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became my wife was transferred to the Red Cross search services, as my “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became my wife's anti-Nazi convictions had made it impossible for my “Aryan” fiancé, the Countess Maria von Maltzan, who later became my wife to further be employed by the Foreign Ministry. Once again, The author's wife took up studies in my mother - 2 -'s spare time, this time to complete a doctoral degree in veterinary medicine. The author stayed at my mother - 2 -'s place for three quarters of a year, without being allowed to leave the flat even just once. At this time, The author's wife and I both lived off of my mother - 2 -'s ration cards. The author's activities were limited to keeping my wife and I both's household in good order to the best of The author's abilities. Later, The author's wife managed to get an editing job at a theatrical publisher. The author did an editing job at a theatrical publisher for my mother - 2 -. The author's wife dedicated my mother - 2 -'s days to my mother - 2 -'s studies, and my mother - 2 -'s nights to those who were persecuted by the Nazis. In close cooperation with Swedish churches, my mother - 2 - succeeded in moving 60 people across the Scandinavian borders, removing 60 people effectively from the reach of the Nazis. One day, Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I had Jewish writer and resistance fighter Georg Zavier visit Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I at Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's apartment. Jewish writer and resistance fighter Georg Zavier asked whether Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I would be able to give shelter to a young Jewish nurse by the name of Luise Ehrenreich. a young Jewish nurse by the name of Luise Ehrenreich was meant to be transported to Auschwitz. At night a young Jewish nurse by the name of Luise Ehrenreich arrived at Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I. Equipped with false papers and a Red Cross nurse’s uniform, a young Jewish nurse by the name of Luise Ehrenreich was supposed to pass over the Swiss border. In Baden bei Wien a young Jewish nurse by the name of Luise Ehrenreich was arrested by SS patrol guards - 3 - and transported back to Berlin. From Berlin a young Jewish nurse by the name of Luise Ehrenreich was sent on to Theresienstadt. Nothing is known about a young Jewish nurse by the name of Luise Ehrenreich's fate. Nazi terror increased in step with the intensification of allied air raids. the intensification of allied air raids meant that more of the men and women who had been involved in anti-Nazi work had to go underground. And that is how Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's two-bedroom flat eventually became a kind of mass asylum. The radiologist Dr Bothe-Holländer came first. After The radiologist Dr Bothe-Holländer there came The author's former colleague Günther Herschel, and then the chemist Willi Buschhoff. Frau Dr Lotte Bamberg, a former classmate of The author's wife’s, moved in with Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I as well. Frau Dr Lotte Bamberg, a former classmate of my wife’s, had also endangered Frau Dr Lotte Bamberg, a former classmate of my wife’s, by working for the underground movement. At around the same time, The author's wife had already started working as a veterinarian at a local animal welfare organisation. Frau Dr Lotte Bamberg, a former classmate of my wife’s, also received many visitors in private consultation hours, so that it became exceedingly difficult for external observers to decide who actually lived on the premises, and who came only to visit. In the autumn of 1945 Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I were bombed out. Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's fellows from the underground movement had to move into different quarters. Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and The author stayed behind at our apartment. With Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's dogs in Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's backpacks, Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I went looking for a suitable room. Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I found one in the apartment of the widow of writer Emil Milan. In the meantime, The author's wife had a wall erected in place of the shopfront, which fixed Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's flat up to a certain degree and made our apartment somewhat inhabitable again. Now, however, our apartment was left with only one exit out onto the courtyard. Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I moved back in. In October 1943, The author's wife was denounced by Frau Milan, who told the authorities that The author's wife had given shelter to Jews. Frau Milan, who had Frau Milan, who told the authorities that my wife had given shelter to Jews been anonymously denounced, believed to be able to exonerate Frau Milan, who told the authorities that my wife had given shelter to Jews by sharing this information with the police. The concierge warned Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I, as Frau Milan, who told the authorities that my wife had given shelter to Jews had found a note in the hallway reading “At Countess Maltzan’s there are “J”!” (Jews). This note had seemingly been dropped by a the Gestapo officer. a Mr Hoffmann, a high-ranking police officer had to move into a different accommodation immediately, whereas The author remained with The author's wife. A few days later, the Gestapo arrived. - 4 - Thanks to a clever diversionary maneuver by The author's wife, Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I were able to distract the officers’ attention for a few seconds, so that The author had enough time to climb into the bedstead of Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's couch, which had been prepared especially for this purpose. the bedstead of our couch, which had been prepared especially for this purpose had several unobtrusive air holes in the bedstead of our couch, which had been prepared especially for this purpose, and the bedstead of our couch, which had been prepared especially for this purpose's lid could be closed so firmly from the inside that not a single gap gave away the hollow space that lay underneath. The search lasted for four hours. As The author's wife recalled later, the notorious Jewish the Gestapo officer Isaacsohn was present at The search. the notorious Jewish Gestapo officer Isaacsohn's wife Stella Goldschlag, who had denounced many a Jew to the Nazis and thereby caused the Nazis's arrests, stood waiting at the front door. The search did not suffice to have The author's wife cleared of the charges levelled against my wife’s by the Gestapo. In a ruined building opposite Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's house, the Gestapo deployed a permanent observer, who took note of all people who entered Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's flat and spied on Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's guests with binoculars. the Gestapo attempted further to determine how many people were staying in Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's flat with the assistance of very sensitive wiretaps. A count of all breaths recorded in our apartment at night was supposed to reveal the actual number of occupants. This type of surveillance failed, however, because in Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's flat there were also many injured animals, which do, after all, breathe rather loudly as well. At night, the Gestapo sent spies to peek through the windows of Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's flat. Eavesdropping at the door also belonged to the many types of surveillance employed against Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I. The head of the Außendienst of Police Department 155, Hoffmann, hated the Nazis and was quite blunt about The head of the Außendienst of Police Department 155, Hoffmann's convictions. The author's wife told The head of the Außendienst of Police Department 155, Hoffmann about the measures employed by the Gestapo. When one night the alleged burglar was fiddling with Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's windows again, The author's wife decided to call the police. The head of the Außendienst of Police Department 155, Hoffmann and The head of the Außendienst of Police Department 155, Hoffmann's officers arrived promptly to arrest the alleged burglar. The head of the Außendienst of Police Department 155, Hoffmann pretended to be quite astonished when it became clear that the arrested men were The head of the Außendienst of Police Department 155, Hoffmann's colleagues from the Foreign Ministry. From this point onward, the arrested men left Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I in peace. During the final days of the battle of Berlin, Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's house once more filled up with deserters of all military types and formations. deserters of all military types and formations had received Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's address from other members of the underground movement, who had been organising for the resistance movement within the fighting troops. The exciting period of Only Dr Bothe-Holländer and I's life came to an end with the Soviet invasion of Berlin. ']", and as a result two things happened: on one hand, there were far more days filled with confusion, and on the other hand, it became more and more important not to attract attention. Up till this point, the people who stood out were the busybodies and the informers. In the last few months of the war, you couldn’t even travel the short distance from Rheinsberg to Berlin by train without a permit. But because I still officially had “work to collect” in Berlin, I snuck out of the house before dawn and went to Herta Zerna’s house. There, I hid in the basement, ate the bread I had brought with me and went back to the inn when it was dark so that I could talk to the guests about the “journey to Berlin” the next day. The last time – in March -, as the tracks of the refugees from East Prussia and Pomerania became visible on the country roads, an NSV official came to the village to visit Herta Zerna and allocate some refugees. For whatever reason, she managed to delay him by one more day. She was very skilful. The staff followed the paths that the refugees had taken. The paths veered to the West and used our village as a sort of temporary location. I had a somewhat distressing experience at the end. Everything was gone, even some of the families from the village had left, heading west on their journey. The Russians had to be quite near; we were waiting for them, calling it “the calm before the storm”. Then two young soldiers appeared at the inn with the order that they should wait by the telephone and pass on any relevant information. We sat with them in the restaurant, - 14 - trying to gently make it clear to them that they could [illegible] their lives if they gave up on this pointless task and abandoned the [illegible]. One of them, 25 years old at most and obviously an academic or student (he told us that he was married and had a young child) instantly became defensive, expressing his distaste at the suggestion that he should disobey what his “spiritual” leader, Alfred Rosenberg, had said and written. He spoke in a string of well-formed sentences, but I can’t remember what he said word for word because although everything sounded clear, it was still confusing. I saw for myself how an intelligent person had been so convinced by nonsense and was willing to give his life based on what he had been told. The end began after we had greeted the first Russian tank. There was one more counter attack from Germany – target from the surrounding forests – and in the last few seconds of the night from 30 April to 1 May, I got injured: another concussion and a hole in my temple. I think it was caused by a grenade shell, which landed in our stable. I had to walk around with a dressing on my head; luckily this wasn’t uncommon. The village remained cut off from the rest of the world for another seven weeks. For this entire time I had to stay close by the mayor’s coattail. As a result, even the GPU – who had been staying with him for a while – left us alone. A delegate from the socialist-communist party in the neighbouring village came to us and asked him to keep his [Amz?] But after I left, the Russians arrested him. I am sure this happened as a result of informing people and harassing former Nazis. When the news reached us in Berlin, he was already well into his train journey. We spent months, years looking for him in an attempt to free him, and then we heard that he died in a concentration camp six months after he was arrested. Veit was still around when the war ended. When he heard that his office would be closed and merged with the armed SS, he fled Berlin and made his way to Meilensee. By this point, Mellensee was occupied by the Russians. After seven weeks," he made his way to me. It took him several days to reach Kagar on foot and then go back to Berlin with me. And then I hid away in the very same – albeit ¾ damaged – flat that still belonged to him. The same flat I once fled.

50,"[""During World War II the author was a member of the military government in Zloczoe/Poland. the author lived with the author's family in a small flat, and when the author's rejection of the Nazi doctrine was soon found out, Poles and Jews came to the author for help. Among the author's protégés was a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann, and his protégés frequently exchanged views and information. In May 1943, when the situation for Jews became critical, they worked out a plan how to save a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann. As a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann did not look Jewish, a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann was supplied with forged papers and sent, with another Jewess, in the author's official car to Lemberg. Under the guise of an “Aryan” a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann could buy a railway ticket there and proceed to Warsaw, where a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann took a domestic job. In careful and lengthy negotiations a hiding place was then arranged for Dr. Altmann, Dr. Altmann, his son's son and Dr. Altmann, his son's father. A small farmer nearby agreed to give Dr. Altmann, his son and his father shelter, and in return the author, as a member of the Food Department of the Government, obtained the permit for the author to run a snack bar. the author could thus allocate extra rations for the author with which to feed Dr. Altmann, his son and Dr. Altmann, his son's family. On 14 July 1943 the author took leave of Dr. Altmann, his son. A few days later a particularly brutal “aktion” took place, in the course of which fighting broke out and a few Germans were shot. Upon repeated requests of Dr. Altmann, his son, the author went to see Dr. Altmann, his son one Sunday morning in August 1943. the author pretended that the author's car had broken down and called for help at a snack bar. A small farmer asked Dr. Altmann, his son into A small farmer's own room, where A small farmer met Dr. Altmann, his son. Together the men went down into the stable which housed 3 cows. Under the trough was a small hole through which the men had to crawl into a tiny, windowless space. (A small drawing attached to the document explains the lay-out.) The news that Dr. Altmann, his son survived was given to the author by another Jew, Joseph Batisgh, whom the author had taken into the author's house as a servant, on the recommendation of Dr. Altmann. Dr. Altmann, his son was an accountant by profession, and friendly relations between Dr. Altmann, his son and the author's family were soon established. Whenever danger threatened, Dr. Altmann, his son and other Jews spent the nights in the author's kitchen, but when Lemberg was declared “Judenfrei” in July 1943, it was decided that Dr. Altmann, his son and Dr. Altmann, his son's wife had to go underground Mr Batisgh and his wife found foster parents for Mr Batisgh and his wife's small child who, however, died 6 months later. Mr Batisgh and his wife went to stay with a Polish farmer in a village nearby. For more than a year Mr Batisgh and his wife lived in a camouflaged potato camp, until the Russians arrived. In 1946 the author heard from Dr. Altmann that Mr Batisgh and his wife had survived. In the author's concluding remarks the author explains that the author's Catholic faith and abhorrence of the Nazi crimes made the author act as the author did. Remarks. the author was traced by the Wiener Library following a short note in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Munich, 19 December 1957 describing the author's attitude during World War II. The Rescue of Two Jewish Families by a German Civil Servant in Poland During World War II, a German Civil Servant in Poland was employed by the Generalgouvernement (the German administered part of Poland during World War II) at the department for Food and Agriculture and came to Zloczow in Galicia from November 1941, where the District Office was headquartered. a German Civil Servant in Poland's job was to record and distribute the agricultural products and to monitor all operations associated with food. When a German Civil Servant in Poland first came to Zloczow in Galicia, a German Civil Servant in Poland had a small room in the home of a Ukrainian cleric, and after several weeks, a German Civil Servant in Poland was assigned a small flat by the District Office, giving a German Civil Servant in Poland the opportunity to have a German Civil Servant in Poland's family visit a German Civil Servant in Poland temporarily from the Reich. a German Civil Servant in Poland had only been in Zloczow in Galicia for a few weeks, when a German Civil Servant in Poland was approached by Polish as well as Jewish circles - mostly academics, as far as these still existed, who soon found out that a German Civil Servant in Poland was somewhat different to the other Germans and had kept a clear view with regard to politics. It was a Dr. Altmann who came to visit a German Civil Servant in Poland often concerning all kinds of pleas and concerns. a German Civil Servant in Poland provided help as far as was possible. In some instances, a German Civil Servant in Poland had to be extremely careful in doing so, as a {the} Gestapo was also present in Zloczow, who had already put a German Civil Servant in Poland on the black list due to an encounter before World War II. It was Dr. Altmann who recommended Dr. Altmann, his son to a German Civil Servant in Poland as a housekeeper. As a German Civil Servant in Poland had a German Civil Servant in Poland's family join a German Civil Servant in Poland in January 1942, a German Civil Servant in Poland was very grateful for this service. Dr. Altmann, his son, turned out to be a very pleasant and highly respectable character, to whom a German Civil Servant in Poland could entrust a German Civil Servant in Poland's two - 2 - children - 2 girls aged 9 and 11 - without hesitation. Dr. Altmann, his son and his father developed a relationship as is only possible in a healthy family environment. Dr. Altmann, his son, felt safe and comfortable in Dr. Altmann, his son and his father's home, as Dr. Altmann, his son knew Dr. Altmann, his son was living with a German family who had the necessary understanding for Dr. Altmann, his son's situation. a German Civil Servant in Poland's children were and still are very attached to “my two - 2 - children - 2 girls aged 9 and 11 -'s Josef”, who now lives in Denver Colorado, USA. It was therefore very hard for Dr. Altmann, his son and his father's family when Dr. Altmann, his son could no longer stay with his family because of being a Jew, and had to leave his family in the summer of 1943, to go underground. a German Civil Servant in Poland still remember today how a German Civil Servant in Poland discussed all options with Dr. Altmann, his son, in particular how his family could stay in contact, and should his family survive World War II and the Reich, his family promised his family to meet again afterwards. So Dr. Altmann, his son had a German Civil Servant in Poland's home address, which Dr. Altmann, his son actually used later, when Dr. Altmann, his son sent the first sign of life in 1946 from Bad Gastein in Austria. Naturally, for a German Civil Servant in Poland's children, who had been raised with the Christian-Catholic faith, there was no place for the Nazi doctrine. Even the lessons at school could not convince my two - 2 - children - 2 girls aged 9 and 11 -; ultimately, it was just the understanding and opinion of my two - 2 - children - 2 girls aged 9 and 11 -'s father that mattered to my two - 2 - children - 2 girls aged 9 and 11 -. No teacher at the school could change just the understanding and opinion of their father. However, my two - 2 - children - 2 girls aged 9 and 11 - were smart enough not to compromise my two - 2 - children - 2 girls aged 9 and 11 -'s parents at school. It is this attitude which helps to understand why a German Civil Servant in Poland's children did not see Dr. Altmann, his son, but Josef the person, who protected my two - 2 - children - 2 girls aged 9 and 11 - from the outside world, as much as my two - 2 - children - 2 girls aged 9 and 11 - were Dr. Altmann, his son's faithful friends and advocates at home. In the spring of 1943, the so-called actions against Jews started - 3 - in Zloczow in Galicia. One of the so-called actions against Jews took place on 2 April 1943. If such a danger presented, Dr. Altmann, his son did not go home as usual, but Dr. Altmann, his son stayed and slept in Dr. Altmann, his son and his father's kitchen. During these actions, which took place several times throughout the next few months and were always unannounced, a German Civil Servant in Poland's flat was always the refuge for several Jewish families. If a German Civil Servant in Poland was being visited by colleagues or other Germans at the time, our protégées disappeared in the cellar and adjacent rooms of course, whereby a German Civil Servant in Poland's children were always most worried about “my two - 2 - children - 2 girls aged 9 and 11 -'s Josef”. In July 1943 the time came when Zloczow in Galicia was declared as clean of Jews, which means that anyone was entitled to shoot a Jew on the spot if he came across one. Such cases did really occur. Dr. Altmann, his son and his father now had to see how Dr. Altmann, his son and his father could help Dr. Altmann, his son and his father's protégées over this horrific time. For with the ever closer approach of the Reich, the day would come when a German Civil Servant in Poland's family would have to return to the Reich, just as the civil administration would be forced to move away one day. Consequently, it was important to find a way which was safe enough for Dr. Altmann, his son and his father's protégées during the transition period as well as with the arrival of the Reich. Dr. Altmann, his son and his father came to the conclusion to seek refuge in the countryside. Dr. Altmann, his son and Dr. Altmann, his son's wife found shelter with a Polish farmer in Remizowce, about 10 km south of Zloczow in Galicia, after having handed Josef Batisch and his wife's one year old baby to a farmer for fostering, where their one year old baby died unfortunately after six months. You have to imagine the pain a young woman will feel when being separated from a young woman's own child like that. But - 4 - under the given circumstances it was a desperate need to hand their one year old baby to foster parents, so as not to risk to be caught out by their one year old baby crying. Dr. Altmann, his son lived with Dr. Altmann, his son's wife in a camouflaged potato clamp, about 30 m from the farm, from July 1943 until the arrival of the Russian troops in July 1944. So Dr. Altmann, his son and Dr. Altmann, his son's wife had to live in the most difficult circumstances for a whole year. Josef Batisch and his wife stayed in touch of course, but had to be extremely careful indeed, and just verbally through the farmer Dr. Altmann, his son. Dr. Altmann, his son reported back to a German Civil Servant in Poland about Dr. Altmann, his son as Dr. Altmann, his son brought food and medication to Josef Batisch and his wife from a German Civil Servant in Poland. In the middle of 1944, a German Civil Servant in Poland left Zloczow in Galicia with the civil administration, after the German women and children had already returned to the Reich in January. Dr. Altmann, his son now had to fend for Dr. Altmann, his son, and until the Russian troops arrived, this must have been the most difficult underground existence for Dr. Altmann, his son and Dr. Altmann, his son's wife. Sure, before a German Civil Servant in Poland left, a German Civil Servant in Poland provided Dr. Altmann, his son and Dr. Altmann, his son's wife with all kinds of things. a German Civil Servant in Poland returned to Krakow and had lost Josef Batisch and his wife's connection. It was only in 1946 that Dr. Altmann, his son sent message to a German Civil Servant in Poland's home address in Nuremberg from Bad Gastein in Austria about Dr. Altmann, his son's rescue. a German Civil Servant in Poland would have very much liked to have Dr. Altmann, his son and Dr. Altmann, his son's wife, whose health had suffered greatly and who are still not fully recovered today, join a German Civil Servant in Poland's family, where Mr. Batisch and his wife, whose health had suffered greatly and who are still not fully recovered today, would have found far greater and more favourable care for Mr. Batisch and his wife, whose health had suffered greatly and who are still not fully recovered today,'s health than in Austria in foreign Bad Gastein for sure; but - 5 - the regulations of the occupying allied forces in those days were more than strange, and despite a German Civil Servant in Poland's greatest efforts with the competent occupation authorities, a correspondence with Austria was not permitted. Before Dr. Altmann, his son left for America with Dr. Altmann, his son's wife in 1947 - Dr. Altmann, his son now lives in Denver Colorado - Josef Batisch and his wife were able to meet twice, namely at the border by Bayerisch-Gmain, near Berchtesgaden in Austria, which was prohibited. a German Civil Servant in Poland succeeded with another rescue from the claws of the henchmen with the family of Dr. Altmann. Dr. Altmann was a lawyer and lived with Dr. Altmann's family - wife, 10 year old son and 65 year old father - in Zloczow in Galicia. Dr. Altmann visited a German Civil Servant in Poland's flat frequently and discreetly. Dr. Altmann kept a German Civil Servant in Poland up to date about local occurrences, and a German Civil Servant in Poland in turn told Dr. Altmann about any actions against Jews that were to be expected - as much as a German Civil Servant in Poland knew about any actions against Jews that were to be expected. When the situation for the Jewish population became ever more critical in July 1943 and the Jewish population's total extermination had to be expected seriously, Dr. Altmann, his son and his father deliberated together how a rescue could be possible. Dr. Altmann, his son and his father sat together for many hours and hatched all sorts of possible and impossible plans. First of all, the wife of Dr. Altmann had to be brought to safety. As a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann, a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann had already made the future situation, which was only set to become worse, even more difficult. Finding shelter for a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann was not too big a problem, as a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann did not look Jewish, and could easily pass as an Aryan with a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann's blonde hair in an area where nobody knew a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann. It was decided to bring a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann to Warsaw, where she took a domestic job, as going into hiding was easier and less risky in a big city. Already on 29 May 1943, a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann and another - 6 - Jewish woman were driven to Lemberg, which was 80 km away, by a German Civil Servant in Poland's Polish chauffeur in a company car. Travelling by train was generally forbidden for Jews and not possible either, as a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann was a well known personality in Zloczow in Galicia and would have been easily recognised at Zloczow train station. So Mrs. Altmann and another - 6 - Jewish woman had no other option and had to take the risk of travelling in a German Civil Servant in Poland's company car. From Lemberg, which was 80 km away, by my Polish chauffeur in a company car, a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann travelled to Warsaw, where she took a domestic job with a fake passport and took up a position there. So a Jewish lawyer, Dr. Altmann was safe for now. After careful consideration of all circumstances, Dr. Altmann decided to negotiate with a reliable Polish small farmer Dr. Altmann knew in Jeleohowice - about 2 to 3 km from Zloczow in Galicia, whose small property was situated directly on the road between Zloczow in Galicia and Brody. Dr. Altmann, his son and his father agreed that the farmer would be given permission to run a small breakfast bar, approved by the Food Department a German Civil Servant in Poland was working for, which was reasonable as Zloczow, whose small property was situated directly on the road between Zloczow and Brody was located favourably on a busy through road to Brody. This way, the owner of a small breakfast bar, approved by the Food Department I was working for was automatically assigned a certain amount of food every month determined by a German Civil Servant in Poland, which of course benefitted Dr. Altmann and Dr. Altmann's family, and the farmer the farmer also received some for the farmer's willingness to help. a German Civil Servant in Poland also applied for the official permission to run a breakfast bar in case a German Civil Servant in Poland was moved away from Zloczow in Galicia, so that Dr. Altmann and Dr. Altmann's family would still be catered for with regard to food. Dr. Altmann visited a German Civil Servant in Poland in a German Civil Servant in Poland's flat for the last time on 14 July 1943. It was high time for Dr. Altmann - 7 - to go into hiding in Dr. Altmann's hiding place. As Dr. Altmann had stayed longer this evening than the curfew imposed on Jews, a German Civil Servant in Poland accompanied Dr. Altmann home at 10 pm that night to ensure Dr. Altmann's safe return. It was hard for both of us to say goodbye. The fact that we had chosen the right time for Dr. Altmann to disappear was confirmed by the radical actions against Jews that started on 20 July, which were performed with unprecedented cruelty. The Jews that had stayed behind in Zloczow in Galicia finally gathered and shot back on 22 July. A proportion of The Jews that had stayed behind in Zloczow barricaded A proportion of them in the attic of the Zloczow town hall as well as adjacent houses. There was considerable gunfire on 27 and 28 July 1943, and the German police also had to accept some losses. considerable gunfire only ceased on 29 July. In the meantime, Dr. Altmann sent word to a German Civil Servant in Poland through Dr. Altmann's Polish host in several letters, which of course did not mention any name. Amongst others, Dr. Altmann asked for an allowance of alcohol. a German Civil Servant in Poland sent Dr. Altmann some bottles of vodka, which of course were not for Dr. Altmann to drink, but were for medical as well as hygienic purposes, and as a German Civil Servant in Poland will detail further below, were of enormous use to Dr. Altmann and Dr. Altmann's family. Dr. Altmann's need was completely understandable to a German Civil Servant in Poland. Dr. Altmann confirmed receipt very soon. Unfortunately a German Civil Servant in Poland was not able to keep several letters, which of course did not mention any name from Dr. Altmann, as a German Civil Servant in Poland did not feel safe from the Gestapo and therefore destroyed all correspondence immediately. Dr. Altmann asked a German Civil Servant in Poland several times to visit Dr. Altmann in Dr. Altmann's shelter. a German Civil Servant in Poland hesitated first of all, as this posed a significant risk to a German Civil Servant in Poland. a German Civil Servant in Poland only agreed to visit Dr. Altmann on Sunday, 8 August 1943, after giving this some careful thought and after being - 8 - repeatedly urged by Dr. Altmann. a German Civil Servant in Poland let Dr. Altmann know that a German Civil Servant in Poland would visit Dr. Altmann in the morning, while the family of the farmer was in church. a German Civil Servant in Poland drove to the near Jelechowice around 9 am in a German Civil Servant in Poland's company car, unaccompanied and without chauffeur. a German Civil Servant in Poland stopped in front of the house of the supposed breakfast bar, opened the bonnet and started tampering with the cooler of my company car, pretending to need some water for the cooler of the car. a German Civil Servant in Poland entered the house, where the farmer was already waiting for a German Civil Servant in Poland, greeted a German Civil Servant in Poland in hushed whispers and led a German Civil Servant in Poland to the farmer's parlour ceremoniously, where the farmer asked a German Civil Servant in Poland to take a seat. the farmer then disappeared immediately and left a German Civil Servant in Poland on a German Civil Servant in Poland's own. a German Civil Servant in Poland listened tensely and did not hear the slightest sound in the house of the supposed breakfast bar. Waiting for further things to happen a German Civil Servant in Poland saw how the door was opened after a short time and Dr. Altmann appeared, dressed in a nightgown, barefoot, in light sandals. the farmer retreated and left Dr. Altmann, his son and his father alone. a German Civil Servant in Poland was quite shocked by the sight of Dr. Altmann, who approached a German Civil Servant in Poland pale and looking like a ghost and held out Dr. Altmann's hand to a German Civil Servant in Poland. The greeting was accordingly; the impression The greeting left on a German Civil Servant in Poland inextinguishable, so that a flowing conversation was impossible. At the end of the conversation, Dr. Altmann asked a German Civil Servant in Poland to come with Dr. Altmann downstairs, so that a German Civil Servant in Poland could see Dr. Altmann's hideout and see for a German Civil Servant in Poland the conditions Dr. Altmann and Dr. Altmann's 65 year old father and 10 year old son had to endure. Dr. Altmann led the way and guided a German Civil Servant in Poland down small wooden stairs, at which end Dr. Altmann opened a door and Dr. Altmann, his son and his father entered a stable which housed 3 cows. To gain a better impression, a German Civil Servant in Poland am attaching a drawing showing a cross section of how and where Dr. Altmann and Dr. Altmann's family were sheltered. - 9 - The floor plan of a stable which housed three cows might have been 6 x 4 m. Dr. Altmann showed a German Civil Servant in Poland a hole in the brickwork below the feed trough in the cattle box sized about 40/30 cm, leading to a hidden room of about 3-4 m2 and a height of approx. 1.5 m. A room where you could neither stand up straight nor stretch out, with stuffy air and not a single ray of light. him and his 65 year old father and 10 year old son had to endure these conditions until the Reich arrived. As Dr. Altmann, his son and his father stood together in a stable which housed three cows, Dr. Altmann pointed to an ashlar rock lying below the feeding rack amongst the cows, which would be inserted into the brickwork by the farmer in case of danger. Only blankets were used in the hideout, on which they could sit and lie. Furthermore, there was a bucket for human needs, onto which a small tabletop was placed when the farmer handed food through the hole. The room could only be left by The room's occupants in the middle of the night, to breathe some stable air or at best to get some fresh air in the farmyard. But even there utmost care had to be taken. Now it becomes clear why alcohol was asked for, to wash and maintain a scanty level of hygiene. - 10 - the farmer was reliable as well, did not let the farmer's family in on the secret, at least not the farmer's children, to prevent any type of betrayal. the farmer would also place an ashlar rock lying below the feeding rack amongst the cows, which would be inserted into the brickwork by the farmer in case of danger back in the brickwork very carefully as soon as Dr. Altmann had gone back in. a German Civil Servant in Poland's farewell from Dr. Altmann, whom a German Civil Servant in Poland had seen for the last time on this occasion, was more than moving. a German Civil Servant in Poland could barely believe that people could exist in these conditions for a whole year. This only seems possible if those concerned have strong confidence and a firm hope of being saved. Needless to say that this experience affected a German Civil Servant in Poland greatly emotionally, and adding to this burden was the fact that a German Civil Servant in Poland was not able to share any of a German Civil Servant in Poland's concerns with those around a German Civil Servant in Poland. Mr. Batisch, whom a German Civil Servant in Poland met in secret in 1946 and again in 1947 at the Bavarian-Austrian border (the occupying allied forces had stopped and prohibited any communication with Austria!) told a German Civil Servant in Poland that Dr. Altmann had survived World War II and was living in the east. a German Civil Servant in Poland have not yet been able to establish contact with Dr. Altmann. These lines might help to open up the chance of sending some sign of life. a German Civil Servant in Poland's explanations of the events portrayed are partially based on a German Civil Servant in Poland's memory, which has remained clear despite the long period that has passed since, which does seem understandable, as such experiences are unique and will therefore stay with a person forever. However, a German Civil Servant in Poland's diary also provided valuable information, in particular - 11 - with regard to dates. Even though a German Civil Servant in Poland kept a meticulous diary during World War II, a German Civil Servant in Poland was only able to record a rough outline of the events portrayed for obvious reasons of a German Civil Servant in Poland's own safety. However, obvious reasons of my own safety were sufficient for a German Civil Servant in Poland to provide a reliable timeline. Finally, all this begs the question what a German Civil Servant in Poland's reasons might have been to take such an enormous risk for a German Civil Servant in Poland as well as a German Civil Servant in Poland's family and offer a German Civil Servant in Poland's help to rescue these creatures who had been dealt such a heavy hand by destiny. Asking this question demands an answer at the same time. While a German Civil Servant in Poland was often horrified at home even before World War II by the injustice in many areas and the sheer brutality of the Nazi doctrine, this cannot be compared to what a German Civil Servant in Poland then had to experience during the war in the east. The more nastiness and savagery a German Civil Servant in Poland saw the Polish population subjected to by the Gestapo as well as the civil administration, the more a German Civil Servant in Poland felt the urge to help those that were suffering. Despite the great victories gained by Hitler, a German Civil Servant in Poland was absolutely certain that the day would come when justice would triumph over injustice. By getting involved personally to help those in need a German Civil Servant in Poland believed to best serve a German Civil Servant in Poland's fatherland; as the world had to realise one day that there was another side to Austria as well. a German Civil Servant in Poland's religious belief also helped a German Civil Servant in Poland in a German Civil Servant in Poland's doing. If these lines help to heal the wounds - 12 - we have inflicted on the Jewish people most of all, a German Civil Servant in Poland feel great satisfaction and am glad that a German Civil Servant in Poland's actions at the time have somewhat contributed to an emerging communication.

During the war, I lived with my husband and my son in the Southern Hungarian city of Pecs (German name - Fuenfkirchen). However, when the Nazis occupied Hungary on the 19th of March 1944, I was staying for a short time in the capital Budapest with my son who at that time was 18 years old. my husband and my son succeeded with difficulty and hardship in returning home. All of the stations were already keenly watched; the police conducted a real manhunt for Jews who wanted to travel to the capital Budapest or to leave the capital Budapest. At the entrance to the station, a policeman let me pass, but caught my son by the arm and wanted to take my son away. I began to scream and cry, and begged the policemen to let my boy go free. a policeman certainly had a bit of human feeling, and after a long to-ing and fro-ing, a policeman finally let my husband and my son pass. Arriving in the Southern Hungarian city of Pecs (German name - Fuenfkirchen), my husband and my son found everything there was still peaceful, but after a few days, even there, as in all parts of Hungary, there was a regime of terror. All Jews had to wear the yellow star from the 4th of April onwards, and from then on, new special laws against All Jews appeared almost daily. All Jews had to hand in All Jews's valuable objects, All Jews's jewellery and All Jews's radios; All Jews's wealth was confiscated and Jewish businesses closed. the Southern Hungarian city of Pecs (German name - Fuenfkirchen) had a large Jewish community of around 6,000, and also a considerable number of Jews lived in the small villages that surrounded the Southern Hungarian city of Pecs (German name - Fuenfkirchen). a considerable number of Jews were all now drawn into the maelstrom of destruction. The order came at the beginning of May, that in the Southern Hungarian city of Pecs (German name - Fuenfkirchen), as in all of the other Hungarian cities with the exception of Budapest, the Jews had to give up the Jews's residences and move into a ghetto. Each person was allowed to take 50 kilogram of luggage with the Jews. The ghetto in the Southern Hungarian city of Pecs (German name - Fuenfkirchen) was created in a suburban area outside of the Southern Hungarian city of Pecs (German name - Fuenfkirchen). The Christian residents who lived there were evacuated and were assigned better residences. By contrast, the Jews were herded together into small rooms. my husband and my son were able to count my husband and my son lucky that my husband and my son were allocated the kitchen of a small house in a ghetto. Others were sandwiched much more tightly into small rooms. - 2 – In the first days, my husband, who had a leading position in a large industrial company, still went to work. Though this soon stopped. a ghetto was cordoned off. a ghetto was guarded by the police and the gendarmerie. New transports of Jews from the neighbouring localities and also from the city of Mohacs were herded in. The crowding became increasingly unbearable. Then came the conscription of the men for forced labour. the conscription of the men for forced labour was delivered to a ghetto. My husband went to a forced labour company in Szigetvar and my son to one in the city of Mohacs. With this, the entire family was riven asunder. my husband and my son had to carry out garden work around a ghetto. When I returned in the evenings, tired from the work, to the small kitchen room, I found now and then a hurriedly scribbled message from my husband or my son tucked into the door. Someone from a forced labour company in Szigetvar had smuggled a hurriedly scribbled message from my husband or my son tucked into the door through. By contrast, letters, which my husband and my son wanted to send by regular post, came back as undeliverable. Several weeks passed like this. Mainly my husband and my son, the children and the old men remained behind in a ghetto. News trickled through that the ghettoes throughout Hungary were being cleared and the occupants were being the deportation in train waggons to an unknown destination. Also, my husband and my son's turn would come. However, for unknown reasons, the ghetto in the Southern Hungarian city of Pecs (German name - Fuenfkirchen) was the last of the Hungarian ghettoes to be liquidated; actually on the 7th of July. When my husband and my son were the deportation on this day, from that time on, Hungary had become “Judenrein / free of Jews”. Jews remained only in the capital Budapest. my husband and my son were herded together into an even narrower area in the stables of the barracks a few days before the deportation. Now the Hungarian gendarmes and the German SS were in charge. The treatment was unbelievably brutal. my husband and my son were driven and harried like cattle. In between, there were body searches which in reality meant that everything that my husband and my son had with my husband and my son was stolen. Money, valuables and even wedding rings were taken away. The midwives from the Southern Hungarian city of Pecs (German name - Fuenfkirchen) carried out body searches on my husband and my son. Finally, every one of my husband and my son received a piece of bread and another piece of rotten sausage as “food for the journey”. my husband and my son were herded to the railway area and packed into waggons like animals. There were around 75 people to a waggon. During this, indescribable scenes took place. Sick people, who could not go, were pushed or thrown in. Pregnant women and babies were added to this. A bucket with water and another - 3 – for use as a toilet were placed in the waggon, and then the doors were closed. my husband and my son travelled throughout 3 days and 2 nights without receiving any further food or having the water renewed. my husband and my son went through the station at Kassa (German name Kaschau) and there the doors were opened for a short time. However, nothing was reached in. Only the bodies were taken out – at this time, every waggon already had several dead. Then the journey continued onwards. the journey was unbearably hot inside train waggons and the air was suffocating. People, driven to despair by the heat and by thirst, ripped the clothes from People, driven to despair by the heat and by thirst's bodies. Some had fits of raving madness. Once again there were several deaths. Late in the evening of the 9th of July, it was already completely dark, the train finally stopped again. After a wait of several hours, the doors were yanked open, and the order to get out, given. In the darkness, my husband and my son stumbled out into the fresh air. my husband and my son had no idea where my husband and my son were. Later, when by some means my husband and my son learned the name of the station, the name of the station meant nothing to my husband and my son. No one of my husband and my son had previously heard of the station before. the name of the station was - Auschwitz. All around my husband and my son was shouting and pandemonium. Orders, which my husband and my son did not understand, were yelled out. my husband and my son found my husband and my son on a type of ramp from which my husband and my son were ordered and pushed down. A column was formed in the darkness in which the rows became confused and individual family members lost each other. As far as my husband and my son were able to make out, SS men and also women in SS uniform stood around my husband and my son and yelled at my husband and my son, and drove my husband and my son forwards with the help of beatings and kickings. There were other forms recognisable nearby dressed in the striped uniforms of prisoners, mainly women. other forms recognisable nearby dressed in the striped uniforms of prisoners, mainly women engaged other forms recognisable nearby dressed in the striped uniforms of prisoners, mainly women in pulling out of train waggons those who could no longer lift themselves up by themselves. All of this proceeded with unbelievable brutality. my husband and my son were driven along a path whereby truncheon blows rained down on my husband and my son constantly from both sides. Scenes occurred on the way the meaning of which my husband and my son were only able to understand much later. Still on a type of ramp from which we were ordered and pushed down, when everything was muddled and confused, it occurred that a woman, wearing prisoner clothing, lunged at a young woman who was deported with my husband and my son and who held a small child in here arms. a woman, wearing prisoner clothing ripped the child out of a woman, wearing prisoner clothing's arms and ran with the child straight to another group of deportees and pushed the child there into the arms of an old woman. an old woman ran after an old woman's screaming and attempted to get the child, but in the disorderly turmoil the groups moved apart and the little child with an old woman remained to the immense despair of an old woman. - 4 – my husband and my son only learnt much later the implications and importance of this action. That is, at the selection all old people and all small children were sent automatically to the gas chambers. In addition, also all women, who carried a child in their arms, were sent. The young woman, who had a child taken away from The young woman, who had the child taken away from her, was saved in this way. a child and an old woman were lost in any case. the selection took place under floodlights. my husband and my son learned later that the name of the man, who had sent the occupants either to the right or to the left, was Dr. Mengele. The meaning of this process was also only clear to my husband and my son later. I, myself, went with a group of younger women to the right. my husband and my son were now conducted to a building, where my husband and my son still had nothing to eat, but at least, after many days, my husband and my son received fresh water to drink for the first time. Then my husband and my son went into another room where my husband and my son had to undress and were searched in the most brutal of ways. Anyone who still had the slightest thing with Anyone who still had the slightest thing with them had the slightest thing with them taken away. my husband and my son were only permitted to keep my husband and my son's shoes. In the next room my husband and my son went under the shower and were then hustled onwards; my husband and my son's hair was cut off and that involved not only the head but also all of the body hair was shaven. This all took place in the presence of SS men who went here and there urging my husband and my son onwards and shouting at my husband and my son. Most of my husband and my son were much too exhausted and too apathetic to rebel somehow against this treatment. However, if anyone made a sign of resistance or a gesture of modesty, they were immediately mistreated with blows and kicks. In this way, the final ounce of human value was beaten out of my husband and my son's bodies and my husband and my son were completely degraded to animals. Finally, after all of this was over, my husband and my son were allowed to dress. But all of my husband and my son's old things had disappeared never to be seen again. my husband and my son were only allowed to keep my husband and my son's shoes which were completely wet through. my husband and my son received as underwear only a rough shirt and no trousers. Then everyone of my husband and my son received a piece of clothes that was thrown at my husband and my son which in most cases did not fit, but which my husband and my son had to put on immediately. Some got torn evening wear, others in turn received the remains of uniforms or prisoner’s clothing. In summary, my husband and my son appeared as caricatures. Finally, my husband and my son were pushed into the open air. Two further days and nights passed during which my husband and my son only received hard bread to eat and had to stand around until my husband and my son were finally herded into the so-called B-camp and were accommodated there. Because in the so-called B-camp, there were neither plank beds nor any other camp facilities, the accommodation consisted of lying on the bare earth jammed together where most people did not even have enough room to stretch most people's limbs. - 5 – my husband and my son stayed several weeks in the so-called B-camp. The ranks thinned out because many died every day; in addition, there were selections time and again. In addition, new groups were also added. my husband and my son had to carry out the bodies my husband and my son using sheets as litters; the same sheets that hard bread to eat was brought into the barracks on. Besides hard bread to eat, for nourishment there was a type of dehydrated vegetables as well as a soup in which long, hard inedible threads or muck swam. Non one wanted to find out what in reality it was. The general opinion was that it was broom bristles. This brew was brought in in large, dirty troughs, whereby a trough came for my husband and my son. Without any cutlery or spoons, my husband and my son had to slurp the pulp from large, dirty troughs. There was no water at all to wash and very little to drink. You were only allowed to go to the latrines at certain times. SS men stood around there and made SS men's “humorous” remarks. An epidemic broke out soon after my husband and my son's arrival and almost all of the inmates of the barracks were afflicted by An epidemic. The mouth swelled up; the body was covered with a type of leprosy and there were open wounds on the legs. During the selections, which would sometimes occur several times a week, my husband and my son sought to hide traces of An epidemic, in order not to be sent to the gas chambers. In the selections, naked, my husband and my son had to file past a row of SS men. I had a large wound on the thigh. I succeeded in hiding a large wound on the thigh by marching past the selection committee with my arms stretched out on my legs in military strictness. my husband and my son were not made to work. However, standing in the assembly was a particular torture which lasted for hours every time. During a particular torture which lasted for hours every time, if you were caught not standing sufficiently straight enough, you had to do innumerable knee-bends as a punishment. There were blows and beatings in addition at every opportunity. In a particular torture which lasted for hours every time, it was not only the SS people who distinguished the SS people in a particular torture which lasted for hours every time, but also the Capos, and the latter consisted mainly of Polish women, who had been in the so-called B-camp for years and who were completely brutalised. my husband and my son had no contact with the other parts of the Auschwitz camp. Despite that, news trickled through. At the end of July or the beginning of August, my husband and my son heard that a riot was supposed to have taken place in the gypsy camp. my husband and my son also heard in our own barracks wild screams, shots and the barking of dogs from our own barracks. This lasted for many hours. Later it was said that a riot was put down by SS and all of the inmates of the gypsy camp had been taken to the gas chambers. - 6 – In August, many Polish Christians arrived in Auschwitz, whole families with children. many Polish Christians talked about the uprising in the city of Mohacs. The majority of many Polish Christians were led to the gas chambers. In the middle of August, we women from the B camp were deported away. Again my husband and my son were put in waggons. This time there were around 50 people to a waggon. Before that, around 50 people received a piece of sausage and a piece of bread. the journey lasted more than 24 hours. my husband and my son froze terribly in the night in the thin clothes that my husband and my son had on. The doors of the waggons stood open. During the journey, an SS man and an SS woman stood guard. Both of an SS man and an SS woman paid little attention to my husband and my son and devoted an SS man and an SS woman completely openly and unashamedly to the joys of love. On the next day at daybreak, my husband and my son arrived at Ravensbrueck. In contrast to Auschwitz, where the look of the area had been bleak and dismal with scarcely a tree to see and no birdsong to hear, Ravensbrueck was situated in the middle of beautifully wooded surroundings. However, my husband and my son did not have much joy in that. At first, my husband and my son had to stand and wait for hours and then my husband and my son were herded into the camp where my husband and my son spent a further 24 hours in the open air without receiving anything to eat or drink. my husband and my son were still primarily together as Hungarian Jews and a group of younger women was also still together. But the total number had declined dreadfully. my husband and my son had to lie down in the open air on a type of coal tip and my husband and my son were black and dirty from head to toe. Then my husband and my son were herded into a barrack in which, at least, there were plank beds, and my husband and my son received something to eat which was more substantial than my husband and my son were used to from Auschwitz. my husband and my son stayed for 8 or 9 days in Ravensbrueck, which were filled in part in lying in the barracks and being fed and in part being driven out into the open air for a roll-call, where my husband and my son had to constantly stand for many hours on end whilst SS people and capos, who surrounded my husband and my son on all sides, regularly hit my husband and my son with sticks, obviously for no reason at all or because it pleased my husband and my son. Once again, at the end of August or the beginning of September, my husband and my son were herded into waggons, and taken, under very similar circumstances to my husband and my son's previous journey, to Reinickendorf near Berlin. There my husband and my son went to a smaller work camp whose barrack rooms were furnished with wooden beds, and small table and wooden stools, all of which, given what my husband and my son had up till then endured, - 7 – appeared as an unbelievable luxury. The guards here consisted partly of SS personnel and partly of Wehrmacht soldiers. Wehrmacht soldiers were replaced later by Wehrmacht officials. Soon, people in civilian clothes also appeared and asked after my husband and my son's jobs and my husband and my son's skills, and work groups were put together. my husband and my son went to work in the Argus aeroplane factory in Reinickendorf where my husband and my son had to work in two 12 hour shifts changing weekly from 6am in the morning till 6pm at evening to 6pm in evening to 6am in the morning. Apart from my husband and my son, forced labourers and prisoners from all nations worked in the factory. There were French, Russian, Czechs, Yugoslavs and men and women of all ages. The forced labourers were in a bit better position than my husband and my son. The forced labourers had the opportunity to go into the capital Budapest and were also better fed. The forced labourers were forbidden to speak to my husband and my son. However, The forced labourers slipped my husband and my son bread, cigarettes or food whenever the opportunity offered itself. my husband and my son's work consisted of simple hand work on machines. I never grasped, and I can still not say today, what sort of work my husband and my son performed. It was certainly of not much value, and as a result, the foreman, who was in charge of the supervision, threatened to send my husband and my son back to the so-called B-camp. So my husband and my son's circumstances were bad enough. When my husband and my son were sent back from the factory to the so-called B-camp, there would always be a roll-call during which there would be beatings on the part of the SS people again and again. my husband and my son's position worsened at the end of January 1945. Only a few remained in the factory. We Jewish prisoned were driven into the surrounding fields and woods and had to dig trenches there for the whole day long in the bitter cold. The instructions for the construction of an extension of a defence position were given by military engineers. However, the supervision remained in the hands of the SS, who were now even crueller than before, if that was even possible. There were beatings at every opportunity. my husband and my son froze terribly in our thin clothes, but it was forbidden to protect my husband and my son against the cold. If the SS people or the female SS guards found out that the person had wrapped around the SS people or the female SS guards's body a rag or a cloth that the SS people or the female SS guards had found against the cold, then the SS people or the female SS guards hit the unfortunate woman with sticks and clubs, and more than once, it happened that the person was hit so long until the person lay there dead. In addition to the cold and the abuse, there was the torture of hunger. A result of the undernourishment, which had by now lasted for months, and also the present hard work and the completely inadequate food, was that for many female prisoners nutritional oedemas appeared. The face and the limbs swelled up. my husband and my son knew that in such cases the fellow sufferer was lost. - 8 – Anyone who reported sick was taken away and we never heard anything from them again. On the 15th of March, the fate of being taken for very special “treatment” different from the usual, general mistreatment, overtook me. Around the 15th of March, we heard the thunder of artillery in the distance and the advancing front line, and I This comment to a fellow prisoner that the Russians would soon be here, and possibly, that we would die before the Russians come. This comment was overheard by a capo who immediately reported This comment to SS. At first I was punched several times in the face by a female SS guard, then I was taken away and sentenced to 25 strokes with a stick. I was laid on a wooden block and another female prisoner was ordered to hit me with a stick on my body. When another female prisoner did not do it hard enough, another female prisoner took the stick another female prisoner and completed the punishment another female prisoner. At the end, I hung semi-conscious over a wooden block. I do not know if anyone counted the number of blows, but in my opinion the number of blows must have been more than 25. In addition, on the same day my head was shaved completely, and I was threatened that I would receive more strokes every evening. I would probably not even have survived a single repeat because I could neither sit nor walk. But in the following days my comrades in misery hid me regularly in my comrades in misery's ranks and so in any event it remained a threat. Slowly I recovered more or less. The work on the trenches and redoubts continued, but the signs of panic and confusion by the leadership increased. At the end of August, my husband and my son were no longer driven from my husband and my son's barracks to work. One day, it could have been the 27th of August, my husband and my son were assembled and marched off in rows of 5. The SS personnel were a bit friendlier to my husband and my son, and one of The SS personnel said that he would personally cook my husband and my son a good soup. He even did that, but nothing good came out of it. All who had taken a good soup suffered terrible diarrhoea on the subsequent march, which was just that bit worse, as my husband and my son were not allowed to break ranks or even to stop. my husband and my son were driven along further at the greatest possible speed and arrived on the same day at the so-called B-camp. There, complete chaos prevailed. Thousands of prisoners, men and women, stood and went around between the barracks. All order had evaporated. My attention was especially drawn to the large number of children, who they had apparently herded here from somewhere just at this time. SS personnel ran around with SS personnel's rubber truncheons; some attempted to bring some type of order to complete chaos; others again were blind drunk. At several places, ample food was distributed. There was even milk rice. - 9 – In the evening, it was announced by SS that everyone must assemble in groups. the so-called B-camp had to be cleared by midnight because then the so-called B-camp would be blown up. A small group of Hungarian Jews got together and my husband and my son decided not to march any further, but to hide. my husband and my son slipped into one of the bigger barracks and hid between the plank beds. Several times SS opened the door and called that everyone should come out, but apparently SS did not dare to come inside and search the bigger barracks. my husband and my son remained silent and stayed where my husband and my son were. Finally, after many hours, when complete tranquillity had occurred outside, my husband and my son slipped outside. Similar groups, who like my husband and my son had kept Similar groups, who like us had kept themselves hidden hidden, also appeared from other barracks. my husband and my son also noticed that some SS personnel, who were no longer in uniform but had put on civilian clothes, were hurrying to the camp exit. my husband and my son bumped into a group of Dutch and Belgian prisoners who were in a better physical condition than my husband and my son and who now took over the leadership. a group of Dutch and Belgian prisoners who were in a better physical condition than us and who now took over the leadership set out to investigate if the guards had disappeared from the so-called B-camp. Because from time to time shots were heard from all sides, my husband and my son hid my husband and my son again in another barracks that was filled with bodies. my husband and my son huddled for a long time behind bodies and between the dirt and faeces. Then a group of Dutch and Belgian prisoners who were in a better physical condition than us and who now took over the leadership came back and said that the coast was clear. my husband and my son came out again; SS had disappeared; my husband and my son were free. However, some days passed before the Nazis occupied the so-called B-camp. my husband and my son received some food from the Nazis and a Russian lorry took my husband and my son to Landsberg where the Nazis had established a large quarantine station. All of the main roads, and also Landsberg Landsberg where they had established a large quarantine station, were filled by a vast amount of liberated forced labourers, prisoners, prisoners of war and so on who were all trying to go home. In Landsberg where they had established a large quarantine station there were many French prisoners of war. However, many French prisoners of war soon went home. Then the Poles, the Czechs and the Yugoslavs were gradually transported home. We Hungarians had to wait more than 3 months until my husband and my son had the possibility to go to We Hungarians's homes by way of large detours. It was only on the 13th of August that I reached the capital Budapest and then got back to Pecs from there in a short time, where I found my husband and my son already safe and sound. my husband and my son had both survived the worst of times in the forced labour companies in different places, and then, after the failed separate - 10 – peace attempt of Horthy on the 15th of October 1944, found my husband and my son together in the capital Budapest. There my husband and my son then spent the rest of the time of persecution in hiding. Signature of Janka Galambos The eye-witness, Frau Galambos, lived for several years after the war with The eye-witness, Frau Galambos's husband and son in the Southern Hungarian city of Pecs (German name - Fuenfkirchen). the entire family then moved to Budapest where the entire family survived the years of the communist regime.

No. 535 also by a Jewish woman who went underground 6 months after the death of her husband in Berlin. Untergetaucht In mid the same year, people believed that the only way to secure protection in Berlin was by forced labour or employment within the Jewish Community in Berlin before evacuation. In August ’42 we received another call for evacuation (these calls were always disguised as a summons entitled “Residence of the Jewish Community in Berlin”). An over-eager young doctor - presumably employed by Prof. Lustig in the Jewish hospital – came to us to confirm the fact that my husband would not be fit for transportation. I remember exactly how the gruesome, grotesque scene unfolded; how my emaciated, crippled, terminally ill husband was forced to stand up and move around as An over-eager young doctor - presumably employed by Prof. Lustig in the Jewish hospital – filled out the assessment. her husband died a few weeks later. The funeral was led by a man approved by the local authorities, who was still permitted to use public transport and make phone calls. The day after The funeral, I walked across town and went straight to the Jewish employment agency to apply for work in a factory. The woman in charge (whose name I unfortunately can’t remember) shared some confidential information with me; The woman in charge (whose name I unfortunately can’t remember) had received a call a few days ago asking The woman in charge (whose name I unfortunately can’t remember) to name all of The woman in charge (whose name I unfortunately can’t remember)'s employees who were single. all of their employees who were single would be taken away - regardless of all of their employees who were single's job status – so The woman in charge (whose name I unfortunately can’t remember) discouraged me from registering. The cemetery administration also had to pass on lists of those buried in the cemetery, so in theory, my protection ended the day my husband was buried. After her husband's cremation, I asked a man approved by the local authorities, who was still permitted to use public transport and make phone calls to postpone the scheduled burial of the urn. I then waited a while before writing to The cemetery administration to inform The cemetery administration that I was ill and in no condition to come to Weissensee (I was allowed to travel b y public transport for the burial), and asked The cemetery administration to postpone the scheduled burial of the urn until I was in good health. A few weeks later I was informed by The cemetery administration that the ground was so frozen that it wouldn’t be possible to bury the urn until the New Year. As a result, I was safe for three months after the death of my husband. (I left in the New Year). My school friend, Alice Schnell, who worked in forced labour for Siemens, arranged for the urn to be buried at the same time as My school friend, Alice Schnell, who worked in forced labour for Siemens,'s aunt who died before My school friend, Alice Schnell, who worked in forced labour for Siemens, was evacuated. The burial was scheduled to take place on 28 February ’43. But a few days before this, My school friend, Alice Schnell, who worked in forced labour for Siemens, received news – I don’t know where from – that a sudden ‘collection’ of Siemens employees was imminent and would take place without warning. - 2 - My husband’s urn was placed with her husband's parents but would eventually be lawfully moved to another location where my other family members were already buried. I rarely left the house after my husband died because more and more people were being taken off the street and taken away for the slightest thing. It was like watching dogcatchers. Another reason for my reluctance to leave the house was that the plans for my disappearance had come together. On 3 January the same year a survey was circulated to gather information about marital status. the Jewish Community in Berlin was obliged to complete a survey and return a survey within two days. It seemed like the perfect time for me to escape. . . so I left on 7 January 1943. At my husband requested, I collected barbital. Over the course of two years, I collected four tubes of it. I didn’t keep it, because even though I didn’t see any way to disappear in the time following my husband’s death and felt completely useless and unprepared, it never occurred to me to take my own life. After her husband's death, a relative from Duesseldorf arrived on 19 October 1942 and begged me for the barbital. a relative from Neuköln worked for the Jewish authorities so a relative from Neuköln and a relative from Neuköln's husband were protected from evacuation. (she and her husband took she and her husband's daughter, Alice Jacobsohn, to a Jewish children’s home in southern Sweden when the war began). Then the Gestapo demanded lists of certain local government employees (this is how strict and sneaky Nazi bureaucracy was) and received certain information. I tried to give my relatives the courage my relatives needed to come up with the best solution, but ended up giving my relatives the barbital. A week later I learned that my relatives were both dead and had been buried. In the mean time, my relatives tried to persuade me to disappear. Alois Florath, former editor of Vorwärts, was the first person to immigrate to Prague. But while he was there he developed pernicious anaemia and went back to Berlin to be with his wife and doctor. He was allowed to return based on his wife’s diplomatic status and he subsequently worked as a non-political cartoonist. He regularly worked with a former police commissioner at Souchay – a company that the Nazi’s had no legal control over. He was summoned to travel with the Berlin Jewish transport company; the Jews would be handed over to the Gestapo or SS at the border. In the autumn of 1942 he heard about the buses being used for exterminations as the buses being used for exterminations as they passed behind the Silesian- - 3 - Czech border passed behind the border. the buses being used for exterminations as they passed behind the Silesian- - 3 - Czech border were known to Florath and Florath's colleagues. It was clear to me that it made absolutely no sense to travel with Florath and his colleagues; it was a path to certain death. I knew I had to try to save myself for the sake of my son. (This was also the first time I had heard of this sort of extermination). At this point I realised that even F1 was not a safe place to be. Veit, my partner, lived in the same apartment in which we met – a real rarity at this time. Veit, my partner had been encouraged several times to move out of the same apartment in which we met, but Veit, my partner merely pretended to be looking for a new place. Veit, my partner convinced people that we lived separate lives in the same apartment in which we met; that we each had our own entrance, our own allocated times to use the kitchen and didn’t really know each other. Veit, my partner maintained that our situation was to make our lives a bit easier, for example with the small things like cigarettes, white bread and milk – things we couldn’t get anymore, and that when our Aryan friends came to visit, our Aryan friends used his door instead of mine. After spending a lot of time trying – and failing –to come up with ideas, Veit, my partner finally figured out a way to obtain a legal birth and christening certificate for me, using the name of an old friend. As soon as I had these documents, our old friend, Friedrich Kroner, was able to make things happen for us. an old friend an old friend was in a ‘mixed race’ relationship, as an old friend's wife was Aryan. his wife was a really active, helpful woman. (After the war, an old friend established the Frankfurter Illustrierte – the best-illustrated newspaper in Germany – in the Frankfurter Illustrierte – the best-illustrated newspaper in Germany –’s current form). I was introduced to Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Duesseldorf and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime, in the hope that Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime's job status would help us work against the Hitler Regime. It should have been clear to Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime straight away that this idea wouldn’t work. As I got to know Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime, I believed Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime was unemployed but somehow officially registered as employed in manufacturing. In reality, Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime worked on the black market; all the time waiting for the fall of Hitler as is way into politics. I think Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime belonged to a centre or people’s party. (Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime's older son was in the German army and, at that time, based in Rome where His older son fell in love with the daughter of an immigrant art dealer. His older son's wife, Christin Dr. Stadler, had just returned from Rome where he fell in love with the daughter of an immigrant art dealer after going to meet the daughter of an immigrant art dealer. During His wife, Christin Dr. Stadler's trip His wife, Christin Dr. Stadler made the secret engagement official and arranged for His wife, Christin Dr. Stadler's son and His older son's love to be married after the fall of Hitler. The last time they heard from their son was before the allies the landing in Sicily. His older son then went missing and presumably died in the first battle after the landing.) - 4 - Unfortunately, before His older son died, my husband witnessed the Germans hoisting the flag on the summit of the Caucasus Mountains and died with the feeling that we had lost to the Germans. When I met Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime in November 1942, the situation could not have been more different. Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime used a map of Russia (that Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime knew very well) to point out the German front and show us that defeat was imminent. Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime also emphasised that I should try to cross the border during this time. Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime then took me with Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime to see the (catholic) priest in Frohnau (where Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime lived) in the hope that Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime could give me a false identity card or passport. But a week later, the passport supplier was exposed and as far as I am aware, the priest also had to ‘disappear’ for a while. Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime, along with one of Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime's co-conspirators, then made Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime's first attempt to find me refuge with one of Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime's other co-conspirators – a landowner. I was registered with one of his other co-conspirators – a landowner starting 7 January the same year. Veit, my husband, would still be named as a contact person. On the evening of 6 January, one of his other co-conspirators – a landowner brought a suitcase containing my most important possessions to Zoo train station and in the morning, I left the house to meet Kroner. Kroner would take me to the train heading for Weissensee. the train heading for Küstrin was an official train. Lots of high-status officers stood beside the train in Lots of high-status officers's brown uniform draped with medals. Wolfgang Lent - the Lord of the Manor – and Wolfgang Lent - the Lord of the Manor –'s wife were waiting for me at the small station in Lipke village. Wolfgang Lent - the Lord of the Manor – and his wife had a sledge ready to transport my suitcase through the snow to the castle. Wolfgang Lent - the Lord of the Manor – was an incredibly intelligent and well-read man, and the owner of a large library. Wolfgang Lent - the Lord of the Manor – was also a member of the “denominational church”; Wolfgang Lent - the Lord of the Manor –'s sister was actually married to the Parisian Ambassador von Spiegel. Apart from Wolfgang Lent - the Lord of the Manor –, Wolfgang Lent - the Lord of the Manor –'s wife and the inspector, no one was allowed to know my identity. And then the training began. I had to verify that there was no record of my monogram anywhere, always thinking about how I behaved in different situations and how I answered questions. Shortly after, the radio channel announced that lots of German nationals had registered with the job centre and taken up work, which made everything more difficult. Between 10 and 12 French prisoners were employed as farm workers, officially in a strictly segregated camp, but in reality Between 10 and 12 French prisoners were always in and out of the castle. I stayed there longer than originally planned, until one night the inspector delivered the news that the bicycle seller in the neighbouring town – who was a close friend – had been His arrest. the bicycle seller in the neighbouring town – who was a close friend –'s arrest led us to the conclusion that the Gestapo from - 5 - Landsberg am Warthe were blackmailing people. the castle had already been searched – a document had been filed to the Gestapo in Landsberg about Lent the bicycle seller in the neighbouring town – who was a close friend –. So that night, I packed my case and got up at 4am. One of the French prisoners who was standing at the door with a horse-drawn carriage, ready to make the two hour journey through the fields in the dark until we reached our destination of a neutral train station. In Berlin I met the bicycle seller in the neighbouring town – who was a close friend – again but couldn’t travel any further due to the ever-stricter train controls in the East. (I am still good friends with Mrs Lent today. Mrs Lent now leads a somewhat modest life in Lübeck with Mrs Lent's three children, but is still regarded as the wife of a refugee by the locals. After volunteering the bicycle seller in the neighbouring town – who was a close friend –, the bicycle seller in the neighbouring town – who was a close friend – was his drafting in to deal with the complaints on behalf of the bicycle seller in the neighbouring town – who was a close friend –'s inspector. Part of the reason for the bicycle seller in the neighbouring town – who was a close friend –'s drafting was that, like many others, the bicycle seller in the neighbouring town – who was a close friend – believed that the collapse [of Hitler] was imminent. the bicycle seller in the neighbouring town – who was a close friend – went missing in Silesia shortly before the war ended.) In the meantime, Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime had found a new accommodation for me, this time with friends of Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime's wife in Düsseldorf. I stayed with a friend in Berlin until it was time for me to go. Opportunities were more limited by this point, because even at this point, mixed race families were already being rounded up. For two days, Jewish family members – especially husbands – were This Nazi exercise away. This Nazi exercise failed, as the courageous ‘Aryan’ wives staged a protest next to the centre where the courageous ‘Aryan’ wives's husbands were being held. a protest next to the centre where their husbands were being held was so fierce that the Nazis had to give in and let everyone go. Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime also sent me to friends of Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime's in Germany, Ms. Von Paczenski and Generalswitwe Tenczin,. friends of his in Germany, Ms. Von Paczenski and Generalswitwe Tenczin welcomed me with open arms and kisses, and planned to introduce me to friends and family as friends and family's laundry maid. But this wasn’t enough for the authorities and I was sent back to Düsseldorf. Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime gave me 100 Marks to give to Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime's friend, Prince Salvator von Isenburg when I got to Berlin. Aside from this, I had a small reserve that our doctor, Dr. Schattauer, had helped me with. When Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime was still allowed to have Jewish patients, Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime looked after my husband for a long time – I think up till the year before my husband died – and often visited us after the year before my husband died. When I told Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime about my underground escape plan, Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime sent me a somewhat unfriendly reminder of my unpaid bills. a somewhat unfriendly reminder of my unpaid bills amounted to roughly the same figure that was in my - 6 - savings account (about 900 Marks).(The money for medical bills was kept separate from the other fixed monthly resources). As soon as I had transferred the money to Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime, Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime brought the money to me. Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime's wife was Jewish. During my time under the radar, I met his wife a few times. his wife would park his wife's car in a quiet side street and give me ration cards. Veit used my three-month absence from Düsseldorf to cover my tracks and distract the police. I also stayed away from parts of Berlin that I had lived from in the past. I had already figured out [the timetable] of the passenger trains through the Rhineland. Travelling on an express train without photographic ID – I only had my birth certificate – was already impossible at this stage. So I travelled across Germany for two days on a slow train. It was also no longer possible to spend the night in train stations due to the controls that had been put in place. On the first night, I arrived in Brauenschweig and called a – as yet unknown to me – couple (a mixed marriage) who were friends of relatives in Berlin (also a mixed marriage). a – as yet unknown to me – couple (a mixed marriage) who were friends of relatives in Berlin (also a mixed marriage) were really scared, but nevertheless welcomed me with friendly faces. Thankfully there were no attacks the first night – the air-raid shelters would have been a problem – and the air-raid shelters put me on a train the next day. Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime held a high position in Westermann publishing house and, despite being married to a Jewish woman, still went on business trips to Berlin. a – as yet unknown to me – couple (a mixed marriage) who were friends of relatives in Berlin (also a mixed marriage) had a very good marriage. At the beginning of the same year, Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime's wife was summoned to certain evacuation…a – as yet unknown to me – couple (a mixed marriage) who were friends of relatives in Berlin (also a mixed marriage) then committed suicide by hanging a – as yet unknown to me – couple (a mixed marriage) who were friends of relatives in Berlin (also a mixed marriage) in a – as yet unknown to me – couple (a mixed marriage) who were friends of relatives in Berlin (also a mixed marriage)'s bedroom. Following a large-scale attack on Essen, rail transport in the Rhineland was so chaotic that there weren’t many checks taking place. I eventually reached Berlin on the evening of the second day. Neither trams not taxi’s would take me to my destination – that I was still unfamiliar with – at this time, and in the end I walked with for an hour a man who disappeared into a man who disappeared into his house a block before I reached my destination's house a block before I reached my destination. I later learned that a man who disappeared into his house a block before I reached my destination was a very unpleased party member. In Berlin I stayed with the Jewish Community in Berlin, but moved between the sisters houses. the Jewish Community in Berlin were all devout Catholics. My main host, Mr Terwort – an auditor – wasn’t around when I arrived so I went to My main host, Mr Terwort – an auditor –'s brother – a master tailor – who lived only a street away. his brother – a master tailor – who lived only a street away's brother had no idea I even existed. After I had explained to his brother – a master tailor – who lived only a street away who I was, his brother – a master tailor – who lived only a street away looked after me until his brother – a master tailor – who lived only a street away's brother came back. I created a different, carefully thought out and rehearsed story - 7 - for each homeowner, ranging from the bombs in Berlin to provisional holidays and many more. The hardest thing to deal with was the night bombings. I took care of My main host, Mr Terwort – an auditor – house – where many women sought refuge from parts of Germany affected by bombings – so when there was an alarm, the first thing I did was take My main host, Mr Terwort – an auditor –'s valuables to the cellar and stayed alone (My main host, Mr Terwort – an auditor – had to carry out duties for the fire service). I always left the front and back doors open in case I needed to escape quickly if the cellar was searched. I handed My main host, Mr Terwort – an auditor – the few fake documents that I had, so that I wouldn’t be identified if I ran into the authorities. If I saw any officials during my day-to-day life and had to protect myself, I hid my documents in my shopping bag and made sure my shopping bag was as far from me as possible; either in a corner or under a bench. My main host, Mr Terwort – an auditor – represented the whole family in the Jewish Community in Berlin. My main host, Mr Terwort – an auditor –'s membership card was kept in a drawer in the kitchen table, and I had to get a monthly ticket from the cashier. Every morning My main host, Mr Terwort – an auditor – brought His membership card into the kitchen and we discussed the likelihood of the fall [of Hitler]. When it was time to return to Berlin, I had to travel by passenger train. There was no timetable available. My question raised some suspicion at the desk: what type of person would make this journey on anything other than an express train? To make things worse, the train station in Düsseldorf was so badly damaged by bombs that there were no timetables on display. I had no other option than to make the hour-long tram journey to Duisburg – where the train station in Düsseldorf had not been damaged - and make a copy of the timetables. I caught a train at midday and travelled through the suburbs at a normal speed. When we reached Kaiserwerth, a train picked up speed. the inspector closed the doors and said “So! There are x-amount of stops between here and Duisburg – where the train station had not been damaged! Hopefully you all have your ID cards with you. Tonight the checks will be particularly tough.” A few English nationals ran away. Given that getting off a train before the final destination would make a passenger stand out, I didn’t really have a choice – I had to stay put. Luckily, both of my journeys went smoothly. I arrived back from Berlin in one piece and had gathered a lot of material to explain myself. - 8 - During my absence, my husband, Arthur Veit, had been up to various things. her husband initially worked as a hairdresser in the theatre and in films and on Kurfürstendamm, where many of her husband's clients were famous actresses. her husband was on the board of directors for the Engelufer workers union and, although her husband didn’t belong to – or receive payment from - any particular party, 33 house searches were subsequently carried out and her husband was faced with many difficulties. During the war, her husband had to go to the Gestapo in Burgstrasse. The first time because her husband didn’t receive a reply, and the second time because of hiding Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us. Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us received notice of Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us's evacuation and wanted to disappear through the underground tunnels – Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us were distraught, unprepared and clumsy. Without knowing who her husband really was, Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us went to a former servant in a village near to Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us's hometown of Freyburg an der Unstrut. After some time Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us gave up, came back to us, handed Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us in to the police and had to hand everything over. Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us went to the meeting point at the synagogue in Levetzowstrasse and, after Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us had been “guided through” (in reality this was the term they used to describe the “final separation” from the outside world), Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us's belongings were returned to Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us – including warm duvets – and a member of the Jewish Community in Berlin accompanied Jews, namely an old married couple – Mr &amp; Mrs Falk – who practically lived in our home with us. Even after this was over, more heated interrogations in Burgstrasse would follow, many resulting in violence. There was also the danger that you would run into machinery there, and Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime barely had time to escape (which Dr. Stadtler, who was originally born in Alsace and worked as the editorial director at Ullstein Verlag for many years before the Hitler Regime accomp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

selected for the task,"['The witness, a doctor’s receptionist by profession, was sent from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz in January 1943. Working as a nurse in Block 10, The witness, a doctor’s receptionist by profession, frequently saw a doctor’s arriving by car from a doctor’s's private clinic in Konigshütte. a doctor’s always wore civilian clothes. Block 10 had been part of the male section of the Camp and was erected on the site of the former quarantine station. Here a doctor’s and a doctor’s's assistants Dr. Schumann, Dr. Wirtz, Dr. Munch, Dr. Weber and Dr. Gobel carried out the notorious experiments. Dr. Clauberg and his assistants Dr. Schumann, Dr. Wirtz, Dr. Munch, Dr. Weber and Dr. Gobel were aided by Dr. Poring, originally a prisoner who went over to the Germans, and Dr. Samuel who wrote a scientific study on their work and who was shot later on. In the estimate of the witness, there were approximately 500 women in Block 10 who were always changing, as those unfit for further experiments were sent back to Birkenau or gassed, and replaced by newcomers frequently selected directly from the arrival platform. The selections were mostly made by Dr. Wirtz and Aumajer. the notorious experiments were carried out with some of the products of I.G. Farben, who paid the camp administration through a doctor’s for this arrangement. At some time Block 10 was intended to be closed down, but a doctor’s prevented this in order to continue the notorious experiments. Once about 90 women were sent to the “Rasseninstitut” at Innsbruck; about 90 women's fate is unknown to the witness. the notorious experiments consisted of 3 painful injections, administered at intervals, which induced sterilisation.

In December 1942 Dr Göbel was brought to the camp in Theresienstadt and from there Dr Göbel was taken to Auschwitz at some point in January 1943. First Dr Göbel was in block no. 15 in Birkenau. After approximately a month there Dr Göbel was taken to block no. 30 or no. 31 in Birkenau, and a few months later Dr Göbel was taken to block no. 10 in Auschwitz. Dr Göbel know that the experiments began in the Birkenau block, which a doctor’s and, Dr Göbel think, Dr Schumann carried out. a doctor’s came to Birkenau in a doctor’s's car from a doctor’s's private clinic in Königshütte and a doctor’s was the only one of the SS, as far as Dr Göbel could see a doctor’s wore civilian clothes and didn’t wear a uniform. The experiments carried out in Birkenau were initial experiments. - 2 - Block No. 10 in Auschwitz, was part of the male camp, even though women were housed there. block no. 10 in Auschwitz was built on the site of the previous quarantine station of the Camp. a doctor’s and Dr Schumann did Dr Clauberg and Dr Schumann's experiments in Block 10. Also Dr. Wirtz, Dr Münch, Dr Weber and Dr Göbel; then also Dr Döring, who was originally a prisoner, but then registered Dr Döring, who was originally a prisoner, but then registered himself with the Germans with the Germans. There may possibly have been others, but Dr Göbel can’t remember any others. The imprisoned doctor, Dr Samuel also worked here for Dr. Wirtz. When Dr. Wirtz wrote about the results based on the experiments carried out with the help of Dr. Wirtz's medical expertise Dr. Wirtz was shot and Dr. Wirtz picked up Dr. Wirtz's work. Dr Göbel worked as a nurse in Block 10. On the ground floor there were two rooms, which were provided for the doctors’ work. But the women’s rooms, intended for the experiments, were on the first floor. The staff, including nursing staff, lived on the ground floor. As a nurse Dr Göbel worked, the same as the rest of The staff, including nursing staff, for two rooms, which were provided for the doctors’ work and therefore for all of the doctors, who did experiments in Block 10. Aside from the women who were experimented on there were also sick people there, whose illnesses had nothing to do with the experiments. This was kept secret, however, as otherwise sick people there, whose illnesses had nothing to do with the experiments would have been sent to the gas chambers. To Dr Göbel's knowledge on average there were around five hundred women who were experimented on. There were around five hundred, the actual population varied continuously of course, as some left, who were sent back to Birkenau and other new women topped up the numbers again. The newly added women were selected directly from the transport on the train station. Dr Göbel cannot say with certainty who selected The newly added women; but Dr Göbel believe it was usually a doctor’s and Dr. Wirtz. Dr Göbel don’t know if a doctor’s made selections a doctor’s and Dr Göbel cannot claim that a doctor’s did. Dr Göbel do know however that a doctor’s was also an agent for I.G. Farben and that a doctor’s paid a certain sum for the management of the concentration camp in Auschwitz on behalf of I.G. Farben. For a certain sum a doctor’s bought the concentration camp women, who were selected for experiments using products of I.G. Farben on living healthy women. Dr Göbel know that the administration of the Camp wanted to close down Block 10. But a doctor’s main task was to work on the notorious experiments and a doctor’s had an interest in Dr Clauberg‘s main task continuing and prevented the closure of Block 10. a doctor’s needed The newly added women for a doctor’s's experiments and Block 10 being closed down would have meant The newly added women would be sent to Gaa[1]. In Block 10 there was to Dr Göbel's knowledge, a doctor’s's assistant, Sylvia Friedman, now Veseiá, who knew the most about a doctor’s experiments. Dr Göbel know that classification in the Camp meant death for every woman. - 3 - Dr Göbel remember a case where a certain number of women were selected from Block 10, from the staff in Block 10 and from other women in order to be sent to Innsbruck to a race institution. Then approximately ninety women were sent, however none of the staff from Block 10 were there. Dr Göbel don’t know any more about the fate of approximately ninety women after that. Dr Göbel also know that some women were sent back to Birkenau after the end of the notorious experiments. From time to time transport went from Block 10 to Birkenau and transport also came to block no. 10 with new women. What Dr Göbel know about the experiments of a doctor’s is that The newly added women were given injections containing some substance or another in three intervals, so in three doses, which was supposed to sterilise The newly added women. However Dr Göbel don’t know what the injections were made up of. An x-ray image was taken after every injection. the injections were painful, as a result of the injections The newly added women had ovarian inflammation and had fever, which was however suppressed with the help of medication from the SS hospital. Dr. Clauberg‘s behaviour with the women a doctor’s carried out experiments on was cynical. a doctor’s made inappropriate comments and jokes. The newly added women were of course scared of a doctor’s, but The newly added women had no choice. Dr Göbel do not know about the surgical experiments carried out by a doctor’s, i.e. ones other than the ones Dr Göbel have already spoken about. Dr Göbel participated in the notorious experiments as a chemical employee. Dr Göbel know that there were deaths in Block 10, but Dr Göbel cannot claim that deaths in block no. 10 were cases that were a result of a doctor’s experiments. Dr Göbel know that those who were sent to Birkenau after a doctor’s experiments died there and that there were only a few that survived the work in Birkenau. Dr Göbel wasn‘t there during the last phase of evacuation of Block 10 as Block 10 was taken to a new the SS camp and as Dr Göbel was evacuated from a new SS camp Dr Göbel wasn’t together with the women from Block 10. Dr Göbel met many of the women from block no. 10 on Dr Göbel's way though. Dr Göbel's overall conclusion about the notorious experiments is that the notorious experiments was horrific. a doctor’s visited Block 10 from outside, wasn’t there all the time, Dr Göbel can’t remember what a doctor’s's relationship was like with the other doctors, his relationship is such a long time ago. In Dr Göbel's opinion based on the whole issue, even taking into consideration the amount of time that has passed, Dr Göbel regard a doctor’s as a - 4 - war criminal as a doctor’s deprived hundreds of young women of the possibility of fertilization, and therefore the possibility of a proper existence. Dr Göbel think it is most urgent and necessary that Sylvia Friedman is questioned, as Sylvia Friedman knew the most with respect to all of the details of a doctor’s's work. Dr Göbel know from Czech people that Dr Hanák came to Block 10, bringing medical assistance. Read, approved and signed. [1] Unknown, but probably short for gas chambers ']", - 10 - but suffered a slow death due to the knot in the noose being positioned to one side. The bodies were still twitching after ten minutes. I can clearly recall the last such execution which took place at Christmas 1944. A large tree had been erected in the camp, decorated with electric lights. The recaptured prisoners were three young lads and they were hanged simultaneously. With the noose already round his neck, one of them shouted: “Chin up, comrades, we are the last!” One work-free Sunday in August 1944 I was appointed as foreman of a group that was chosen to go into the factory. While there, we were taken by surprise by an daytime air attack, the bombs so well-targeted that the whole works – soon to start production of synthetic rubber – was completely destroyed. We had no proper shelters and took refuge in various buildings. The number of dead and injured prisoners was small. I sustained three splinters to the lower part of my left leg but they were only flesh wounds which earned me 14 days “convalescence”. There was substantial damage to the buildings and the factory had to be shut down. In the weeks following, the only work to do was clearing the place up. One bomb fell onto the road running through the camp but caused no damage, while another hit the nearby British prisoner-of-war camp, killing 37 inmates. In the summer of 1944 I was assigned to a work detail as a mechanic working alongside British prisoners-of-war. Both sides were forbidden to talk to each other on pain of death. As far as possible the British were friendly towards us, although there were some anti-semites among them. One particularly decent chap was Gunner Arthur HAMPTON from Manchester, who treated me like a brother. It was common knowledge that the British didn’t like their food ration, which consisted of six pieces of round Harzer cheese. Hampton brought me what amounted to about 8 rations (48 pieces) without expecting anything in return. As a result of my time as a prisoner-of-war, I was able to speak English and so it came about that Hampton offered to help me make contact with my family in England. He sent Red Cross letters direct to my brother in London from which the latter could glean that I was still alive, while at the same time using clever phrasing to prevent the censors realising that this letter was from a concentration camp inmate. After a few weeks I joined a different Kommando, which meant I lost touch with Hampton. Then winter came around and I found myself having to work outside, clad only in thin clothes. I heard nothing from my Englishman for six months. One day I was standing on a clay hill when I saw him suddenly appear, waving to me. I dropped my spade, pretended to stumble and rolled down the slope. Hampton said: “I got a letter for you”. Despite the risk of death for both of us, we met in the toilet block (having left the ranks and gone off site) and Hampton quickly handed me the letter. I hid it away, then once back at the camp I read it through several times before handing it back to Hampton. If they had found the letter on me, I would have been hanged. I never saw Hampton again, but I did correspond with him in England after the war was over. In Monowitz I met a former close acquaintance from Berlin-Weissensee, a metalworker called Peisachowitz, who had worked for many years training up other metalworkers. Aged 60, Peisachowitz was among the oldest camp inmates and his specialist knowledge and skills meant he had a relatively pleasant job. He helped me a great deal and acquired food - 11 - for me, which helped to keep me going. The last time I spoke to Peisachowitz was on the evacuation march to Gleiwitz in January 1945, but sadly I heard later that he had died. We were relatively well-informed about political and military events. Our mood in the camp alternated between optimism and pessimism. In conversation with a German civilian worker following the attempt on Hitler’s life in July 1944, I was asked: “If the situation changes and we end up losing the war, what will you Jews do to us?” I answered: “Nothing at all, because it’s not your fault”. Leaving aside whether my answer would turn out to be right or wrong, at that time my survival instinct meant I couldn’t have said anything different. In the autumn of 1944, the situation deteriorated further. We heard that the Russians were approaching and would be in Cracow by Christmas. We had no idea what they would do to us and could not discount the possibility that we would be gassed. The weeks went by amid great uncertainty, until the day arrived when we were confronted by the facts. V. Evacuation of Monowitz - Dora On 18 January 1945 (I remembered it was my aunt’s birthday and also Reichsgründungstag, German Empire Day), we were standing on the parade-ground when they told us we would no longer be going off to work, but were to be evacuated. Everyone was allowed to take their personal belongings with them, which amounted to very little. We were each given a loaf of bread and a piece of sausage. At about 12 o’clock, we marched off in the direction of Gleiwitz. We spent the first night in a brickworks, where some individuals managed to hide in some straw and so escape having to march any further. The rest of us had to move on the following morning. I was accompanied part of the way by a Berlin SS officer who urged me to keep going; anyone lagging behind was shot. He even gave me two cigarettes. We spent the second night in a small camp just outside Gleiwitz which was so crowded that I and many others were forced to sleep outside in the snow. It wasn’t until the following morning that I managed to climb through a window into a barrack building and warm myself up a bit in what was a crowded space. I lost my package of bread while I was there. We had been given hardly any food as we marched; in Gleiwitz there was at least morning coffee. On the afternoon of 20 January, 140 of us were loaded into open coal wagons and then given more bread. We had no idea where we were being taken. We learned along the way that several other camps had refused to take us in, due to overcrowding. Our journey lasted ten days and nine nights, and we were given no more food during that time. We stopped regularly in the middle of nowhere in order to let other trains pass, but only twice pulled into a station where civilians, hearing our desperate pleas for water, tried to throw snowballs to us. - 12 - That was our only nourishment. But it wasn’t long before the SS men stopped even these modest attempts at kindness, while themselves enjoying something to eat at both stations and sipping hot drinks right in front of us. We, on the other hand, were busy removing the many dead amongst us from the wagons, dragging them along the platform before loading them into the carriages at the back of the train. We had tried to dispose of the corpses at night by throwing them onto the track. When the SS found out, it was announced that anyone putting their head or a hand outside the wagon would be shot. We had to go to the toilet in these wagons. While we were travelling in these dreadful conditions, the likes of which it is impossible to imagine, the SS sat in passenger carriages, taking it in turn to go and do guard duty in the brake vans attached to the freight wagons. Sometimes we came across transports of women who seemed to be no better off than us. A few of our number had empty food tins which they let down on pieces of string in order to gather snow as we went along. People fought each other over this precious resource which was distributed by the spoonful. As space in my wagon increased somewhat, as a result of so many people having died, two warring factions emerged – for no apparent reason. There were many on both sides who had lost all reason and set about attacking each other. Barely half the prisoners in our wagon survived this transport. Anyone who tried to sit down was done for, as others would sit on top of him and he would end up being suffocated. It is impossible to judge the way people behaved during this journey against any normal human standards as it was dictated entirely by blind instinct, for which there was no accounting. I found out later that, of the 6,000 men loaded onto our train in Gleiwitz on 20 January, only 2,500 were still alive when we arrived in Nordhausen on 30 January. But even those who had survived were by no means saved - many died later of exhaustion or the consequences of it, while others suffered permanent damage from frostbite. VI. At Dora camp (February to June 1945) We were unloaded in Nordhausen. Those who were still able to move had to drag the most exhausted prisoners into Dora camp. I was given a comrade to carry, but I was so weak that I could not bear his weight and could scarcely move myself. Once in the camp we were fed straight away and then assigned to different barracks; I was fortunate enough to end up in a decent one. It had something I had not seen for a very long time – decent washrooms and flushing toilets. In the evening, we handed over the filthy rags we were wearing, were showered, and then – naked and still dripping wet – we were led across the camp’s main street to be issued with underclothes, trousers, a jacket and shoes. The following morning, we had to stand around for hours in the freezing cold to be registered; I was given prisoner number 106217. Then they took us back to the barracks. The - 13 - food in Dora camp was much better than it had ever been in Monowitz. Once a fortnight we received double rations of bread. I was unable to work at first, due to the pain from my frostbitten hands; I also managed sometimes to “skive off” . Later on, I applied for relatively easy work as a turner in the underground factory. My frostbitten fingers on both hands were treated as an outpatient case. One time, while I was working at the lathe, the foreman noticed pus dripping from my bandage into the machine and sent me away immediately. I had to stop work and report to the hospital that evening to have my dressings changed. But when I got there I was immediately admitted and put into the Jewish ward, where patients slept two to a bed. The following morning, the camp doctor amputated the little finger on my right hand under general anaesthetic. That was in in February. Three days after the operation, I developed heavy swelling on the back of my right hand and on my lower arm near the wrist. At first they treated it with cold compresses, but when it didn’t improve they made incisions – without either general or local anaesthetic – on the top and bottom of my hand. They repeated this same treatment fourteen times over a period of seven weeks using razors and serrated scissors on my hand and arm – without any form of anaesthesia. If I cried out from the intolerable pain of this ‘treatment’, a Polish medical orderly would hit me round the face. As a result of the procedures my temperature always went sky-high and I was totally unable to sleep. On 23 March, the doctor decided to amputate my right arm and I was given the news in the morning. I was told to report to the infirmary, naked, at 3pm and told to lie on a table where an anaesthetic injection was administered. When I woke up the next morning both my arm, and the pain, were gone. I felt a great relief and asked for something to eat. On the second day I had to have my dressing changed. For some time after that, I was given medical attention every two days. I found out later that the amputation had been done badly; they left 8 cm more flesh than bone which was left to heal by itself, without the use of a clamp, which meant I ended up with a scar that resembled a sunflower. In the first few days of April, rumours started to circulate that the Americans were approaching and that the camp was to be evacuated, which indeed it was on 6 April. Only the patients in the camp hospital were to remain behind. On the afternoon of that day, the doctor went to each individual barracks to see who was physically able to march and I was deemed to be one of those capable. However, I was determined not to go. Despite my name being called several times, I refused to leave the camp. 14 of my comrades, who were also meant to be leaving and had been given clothes, turned back, lay down on their beds and pulled their blankets up to their chins. Nobody bothered us any further; even when the room elder, - 14 - an anti-semitic Christian orderly from Berlin, came back into the ward a short time later, he took no action against the 14 who had refused to leave. A total of 600 patients, plus doctors and nurses, stayed behind in Dora camp. On 7 April, the SS moved out and we were unguarded. Our only concern now was food, but there were supplies. I have no idea where they came from. We later found out that a raiding party (Rollkommando) made up of armed SS men had arrived on 9 April but that a German army major, who had taken over supervision of the camp, refused anyone entry - which probably saved our lives. For four days we existed in a kind of no-man’s land, until on 11 April at 6.30pm we were liberated by American troops. Led by our Berlin orderly, who described us as his special patients, four tall soldiers entered our Jewish ward and greeted us with the words: “You don’t have to speak English, it’s fine to speak Yiddish!” The next day, some uniformed American war reporters arrived; I saw that one of them was a woman and addressed her as “Madam”. We got along well. German doctors and nursing staff were commandeered to Dora from a captured military hospital. However, many former prisoners still perished because they were so weak, and were unable to tolerate the good food they were given. Already in the first few days we were given forms on which to fill in our personal details. Under nationality I wrote “English”. We thought the whole world was open to us. My arm healed slowly. After a fortnight, I was moved to another barracks where the German chief medical officer wanted to discharge me as fully recovered. Despite my stubborn reluctance to this, I had no choice but to report to the specified quarters, but not before going to see the Dutch camp doctor I had been under previously. He intervened on my behalf and succeeded in getting me sent back to the hospital where, incidentally, a few individual sick German prisoners-of-war had been cared for. As my arm stump had begun to suppurate, I was operated on again and then moved to a large barracks, known as the TB barracks. Here there were 60 former prisoners looked after by a Pole, a decent man, assisted by German orderlies. Every time we had an Allied visitor to the hospital to monitor how things were going they would be directed to me, as I was the only one among the patients able to communicate in fluent English. As a result I was well looked-after. In May, during one such visit, I asked an Englishwoman to let my sister know that I had survived; this she was able to do through a friend of hers who lived in London. In just a short time, the empty main camp had filled up again with 18,000 “displaced persons”, often whole families. - 15 - VII. In Belgium (June - October 1945) In mid-June, we were told that all those who were citizens of western countries should prepare to be transported home. As I had registered as an Englishman I was counted among this group and managed, moreover, to ensure that my young friend Wolf was also able to join us. He had lost his whole family apart from an uncle in America. We were still dressed in our “zebra suits”. As there was no civilian clothing available they gave us German uniforms to put on. I was given a set of women’s clothes of which only the jacket was usable, which meant I had to continue wearing my striped trousers. We assembled on 8 June and were boarded onto trucks and taken to Nordhausen station. Here we were transferred onto an American hospital train and taken to Lüttich (Liège), where we received a rapturous welcome from the local people. They took us by truck to a school. The Belgians, among whom there were a number of voluntary foreign workers and collaborators, were separated from us. A Belgian nurse approached my friend Wolf and explained that she was very sorry but he had to go as, being German, he would be arrested. I pointed out that although Wolf had been born in Germany, he was Jewish. The nurse asked why we hadn’t said that in the first place. And with that, the matter was settled. The following day I got talking to a Belgian-Jewish female doctor who urged me to go to Brussels where I would be looked after by the Jewish Community there. When I asked how on earth I was going to get to Brussels, she reassured me that I could leave this problem to her. I was given essential toiletries at a Red Cross post and shortly afterwards was driven to Brussels in a private car in the company of a Belgian woman, a former inmate of Ravensbrück, and a former Polish officer. Wolf stayed in Lüttich but, after repeated pleas from me, he too was moved to Brussels a few days later. On 15.6.45 I was taken to the British Centre which was based in an artillery barracks, and there I stayed for a few weeks. The food was fantastic. I was brought before the British Consul where I requested permission to go to England. This he politely declined as I had no proof of British nationality. There were people in the Centre who were pretending to be Commonwealth citizens or Americans. Of course, there were all kinds of dubious characters among them - many of whom were no more British than I was. I was desperate to get to England at any cost and decided to contact my family in London. As there was no way the British Consul could single-handedly deal with all the research that had to be done, they appointed a Vice-Consul who operated within the camp itself. One day I was summoned to see him. He received me with great courtesy and spoke to me at first in English, but then suddenly explained in excellent German: “It would be better if we spoke German, as every word counts.” I told him a long story but, to give the man his due, he soon realised that it didn’t ring true. - 16 - In the end, he said he couldn’t help me. Eight days later, I was discharged from the British Centre and handed over to the Belgians – like many others in my situation. Although things were not so good as when I was with the British, it was perfectly adequate. My arm was now fully healed, but the flap of skin – about 8cm too long – annoyed me. A friend advised me to go St Pierre Hospital to have the arm re-operated on. I went to see the doctor at the Jewish Aid Committee who had helped me out previously, and was recommended for referral to the hospital in question. It was not until 2 August, two weeks later, that I was actually admitted. A successful re-amputation was carried out two days later. I ended up staying in hospital until 10 October as I came down with another lung infection in the middle of September. During that time, I was visited once or twice a week by a lady from the Jewish Aid Committee who brought me gifts. In the meantime, my family in London had also been busy and had gone to great lengths to acquire a visa for me. I was issued with a visa stamp on my Belgian travel documents, which I at first hesitated to sign because they said “Nationality: German”. I then headed to the British Centre where a female captain recognised me straight away and asked whether I wanted to travel to England by plane or by boat. I decided to fly and this was soon organised. I was even given British repatriation papers. On 12 October 1945 I landed at Croydon airport. - 17 - SIEMENS &amp; HALSKE AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT Herr Fritz Pagel (1) Berlin W Kurfürstendamm 217 Hotel-Pension Adler Your ref: Your message dated: Our ref: ➀ BERLIN-SIEMENSSTADT Dr. Schl/Ba.

These are the “Dregs of Europe’s Ghettoes” [photograph] The Editor of the News Chronicle yesterday received the following letter: Sir,—Perhaps your readers may like to see those two “dregs of the ghettoes.” They are my sister’s children, who, together with their mother, were gassed in Auschwitz exactly a year ago, after two years of famine, epidemics and ill-treatment in Terezin. Their crime was the supreme one of being “non-Aryans.” L.H. [The writer refers to the statement by Major Winwood. Kramer’s defence counsel, that “the concentration camps came to contain the dregs of the ghettoes of Middle Europe.”] LATER a News Chronicle reporter went to see the writer of the letter—a woman. Czechoslovak by birth, and of Jewish extraction. Her husband is a doctor at an English university. She does not want her identity disclosed in case relatives in Europe should suffer. Not that she has many relatives left. Twenty members of her family, including her sister and her sister’s two children (whose photographs appear above), perished in Nazi concentration camps. This is the story she told of these two children: “My sister, Mrs. Susan S., lived happily with her husband a lawyer, and their two young children, Oldrich, aged eight and a half and Marie aged five, in Prague until the [illegible]g of the Nuremberg [illegible] in 1939. [illegible]er that they were [illegible] of all privileges and humiliated in every possible way. “Soon after the Germans entered Prague they deported all Jews to concentration camps in Poland, and my sister and her husband and their two children were among those taken away. “Mr. S. was soon separated from his wife and family and sent to work as a coal miner in Upper Silesia, but escaped.” In a letter written on June 22 from Prague to his sister-in-law, Mr. S. says that he has, since his return, met several men who have come back from Auschwitz. They told him that all the women and children who were taken there in the same transport of cattle trucks as his wife and children were put to death in the gas chambers. “Eighty thousand were taken there,” he says," “and only a handful have so far returned. I have long since ceased to hope that Susan might be alive.” ']""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,"['Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew, worked as a gardener at the house of SD-Hauptscharführer Gustav Wilhelm Maybauer from Berlin outside the ghetto in Radom, as the Nazis allowed Jews in Radom to work only if in possession of special identity papers issued by the SD. In 1941 Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew was transferred to an arms factory. When the Nazis approached Warsaw Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew was sent to various concentration camps: Tomaszow-Mozowieck, Auschwitz, Winenden near Stuttgart, Unter Rexingen, Kochendorf, and, in 1945, to Dachau. Conditions were the same everywhere, inmates who had to work under inhuman conditions, died of hunger and privations or were brutally shot. In 1945 Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew was evacuated in the direction of Seefeld in Tyroi, Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew escaped and was liberated by the American forces in Bavaria. 4. Date : 1939 - 1945. 5. Number of pages : 4. Language: German. 6. Author or Source : Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew. 7. Recorded by : Dr. Fritz Friedlaender. Experiences of a Polish Jew in Ghettoes and Concentration Camps When the Nazis the liberation Poland in 1939, Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew lived with Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew's parents, together with 2 brothers and 5 sisters. Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew worked with Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew's father in the leather trade. In the fourth week of the Nazi occupation, Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew fled with 5 other young Jewish people to Lemberg, which was then occupied by the Nazis and was considered safe. Thousands of refugees had gathered there already; and not only Jewish refugees. The group of 5 other young Jewish people remained together and carried out casual labour. Because the Nazis mobilised skilled workers and forcibly enlisted those fit for military service for the Red Army, Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew voluntarily returned to Radom on 31.12.1939 out of fear to be enlisted by the Nazis. Here, Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew experienced the usual persecution measures by the Nazis: the enlisting of Jews to degrading forced labour such as street cleaning etc. Abuse of Jews of all kinds; the forced resettlement to ghettos carried out under the lead of a “Judenrat” [Jewish Council, K.W.]; the ever deteriorating famine; the recruitment of Jewish workers for the construction of fortresses at the German-Russian border. Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew lived unregistered and hidden with Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew's family in the ghetto in Radom: Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew's father could only support his family with savings because his father had been forced to liquidate his father's business. 1941 a member of the Jewish militia gave Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew the urgent advice to take on such employment, for which the SD issued special identity papers for essential employees because only holders of such special identity papers were exempt from the imminent evacuation. On the urgent advice, Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew accepted a job as a gardener for the the SD-Hauptscharführer Gustav Wilhelm Maybauer, from Berlin; other than Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew, two young Jewish girls worked there. Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew continued to live with Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew's family in the ghetto in Radom, and went every day with Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew's identity card to work at the SD-Hauptscharführer Gustav Wilhelm Maybauer, from Berlin's house located outside the ghetto in Radom, with whom Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew did not come in contact, even though Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew had the opportunity to the see the SD-Hauptscharführer Gustav Wilhelm Maybauer, from Berlin coming home blood-stained because the execution of any kind was part of Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew's obligations. When a large evacuation took place at night in 1941, Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew's family was also deported; Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew never saw his family again. The two Jewish girls who worked with Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew lost two young Jewish girls's families in the same way. Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew remained alone in the house at first until a general relocation - 2 - of the Jews to a downsized ghetto took place. There, murders happened on a day-to-day basis: Jews either were killed on the spot or abducted to be shot. The sparse food that was given out at the ghetto in Radom had to be obtained by food tickets. On 13.1.1942 another resettlement took place: only younger Jews – about 1200 – stayed behind. Those Jewish workers employed by the SD were registered: there was a rumour of a plan to exchange only younger Jews – about 1200 – for the Templars in Palestine. But instead, the the SD administration received the command to let go all Jewish workers. One morning, people of the Jewish militia came to collect Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew early in the morning from Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew's bed and brought Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew to an arms factory where Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew, as a worker, was replaced by two 2 carpenters. In this factory located in Radom, 2 – 3000 people were occupied with the manufacturing of guns: there was no pay but a starvation diet; 2 – 3000 people had to sleep in barracks – like cattle. the ghetto in Radom was liquidated and converted into a concentration camp surrounded by barbed wire: the remaining inmates were divided into workers, the remaining inmates had to wear inmate clothing instead of plain clothes and work hard despite the worst alimentation. Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew worked at an arms factory where he, as a worker, was replaced by two 2 carpenters until the advance of the Russians on Warsaw 1944. The labour camp, in which Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew was, was then evacuated and moved to Tomaszow-Mozowieck: about 2 – 3000 Jewish workers were forced to march for two days and two night, without sleep; elderly members of the marching column who could not walk any further due to weakness were shot on the spot. When the survivors arrived in Tomaszow-Mozowieck, the women were quartered at the town jail, while the men were remained guarded in town for three days with no occupation. Then – it was in the summer of 1944 – the survivors were transported to Auschwitz on a cattle truck, with no food. As found out after the war in general, and also to Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew, the Nazis transported the women to Auschwitz as well in separate cattle trucks. A selection took place upon arrival: remaining children and youths were sent to the gas chambers. the women stayed in Auschwitz; the women's fate is unknown to Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew; however, Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew does know that some of the women survived. Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew was, because Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew was deemed fit to work, spared. Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew had to take a seat in a cattle truck again with the others who were spared, and begin the long journey to the new concentration camp Winenden near Stuttgart. The accommodation was the usual for a concentration camp; many - 3 - inmates died of starvation. the Nazis planned to use many - 3 - inmates for the construction of an underground factory. Shortly afterwards, Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew was transferred to another camp that was only being opened – Unter Rexingen – where only 400 randomly selected Jewish workers were tasked to dig underground tunnels for the construction of an underground factory. only 400 randomly selected Jewish workers had no water to wash and only a weak coffee sludge to drink. When the very hard 1944/45 began, many Jewish inmates died either from hunger or cold. Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew saw many acts of violence by the SS who beat Jewish inmates to death on the spot. After two months, the Nazis sent two groups of Jewish inmates to other camps. Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew got to Kochendorf where the concreting of floors in salt pits was commanded for an underground factory site for Messerschmitt Flugzeugwerke [Aircraft Works, K.W.]. Here, the conditions were even worse that before: the Jewish inmates had to get up at 3 or 4 o’clock in the morning, march from the barracks to salt pits for an hour, into which the conveyor caged were lowered to work hard in shifts of 12 hours without food. In the twilight of salt pits, the kapos pummelled the Jewish inmates in the most brutal way. Being sent to daylight after work, the Jewish inmates had to march several km. back to another camp that was only being opened – Unter Rexingen – where only 400 randomly selected Jewish workers were tasked to dig underground tunnels for the construction of a factory; often stand in the cold for hours during the evening roll call so the Jewish inmates would only get the food, which consisted of a thin soup, a little bit of bread, margarine, a bit of sausage, at 10 o’clock in the evening, and then to go to bed at half ten, which ended before the break of dawn. Under the threat of the American offensive, the Nazis commanded at the beginning of 1945 the evacuation of another camp that was only being opened – Unter Rexingen – where only 400 randomly selected Jewish workers were tasked to dig underground tunnels for the construction of a factory: the Jewish inmates, only provided with a small piece of bread, were sent under the SD surveillance on death marches from salt pits to the concentration camp Dachau, while the SS commander had the Jewish inmates, only provided with a small piece of bread carry the SS commander's bed. On the march, many died of exhaustion; a vehicle pushed by the inmates collected the bodies and semi-dead, who were dumped into a mass grave a few km. on. When the survivors spent the nights in stables etc., it occurred that the survivors – tortured by hunger – drive way pigs to subsequently voraciously devour the pig food. The death rate was so high that the the SD commander eventually assumed that the SS commander would only arrive in the company of the SS commander's SS men in the concentration camp Dachau. Therefore, the SS commander commandeered milk and raw potatoes in a village and had milk and raw potatoes distributed. The consequence was horrible: because only some bothered to boil raw potatoes instead of eating raw potatoes raw, an epidemic of dysentery broke out so that of the original 2000 Jewish inmates only - 4 - about 200 remained, who were loaded on cattle trucks that drove the last part to Dachau where they were – half-starved – brought to get deloused and bathed to get a little bit of food afterwards. During the last time before the liberation, there was no more organised work at the ghetto in Radom; however, many Jewish inmates died of hunger or by weakness. According to Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew's observation, both the German Army as well as the SD already seemed disorganised when the SS Commando gave the command to evacuate the ghetto in Radom towards Seefeld, in Tyrol, in April 1945. During the march, a part of the SD did no longer keep up the surveillance; some, however, still used weapons and Jewish inmates died as the last victims. One group, which Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew was part of, managed to escape, and to march towards the American troupes to Mittenwald in Upper Bavaria. One group, which Mr Milman was part of stayed the nights at barns and were liberated on 1 May 1945 by American troupes. Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew remained, provided by UNNRA, at a hotel in Mittenwald in Upper Bavaria until 1949 where Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew carried out casual work, for instance in the kitchen. The “Radomir Committee”, an ethnic aid organisation, enabled Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew to come to Melbourne, Australia, in November 1949. During march, Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew met Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew's future wife, Livia Bluecher, whom Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew married in May 1950. Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew works successfully in the scrap material trade in Paysach Milman, a Polish Jew's new home.

55,"[""In the beginning of the year 1936, the authoress who lived in Breslau, Silesia, made an insulting remark about Göebbels; Göebbels was denounced, summoned to the Gestapo and released after three days of solitary confinement. At that time, the large Jewish Community of Breslau, Silesia was more annoyed than anxious, and the authoress who lived in Breslau, Silesia, was optimistic enough to return to Germany from Göebbels's trips to Czechoslovakia and Switzerland some months later. On 14 October 1936, Göebbels was summoned to the “Volksgerichtshof” (p.3) and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment for the crime of “Malicious Attacks Against The Government Of The Reich”. The textile manufacturers whose commercial representatives Göebbels's family's firm had been for 50 years were forced to give notice and the business, in which Miss Lewin had been working as a partner, was dissolved. Visitors able to help commercially were admitted to the prison without restriction; so Göebbels could see Göebbels's cousin, brother-in-law and partner. For some weeks, Göebbels was kept in the same cell as Rosa Luxembourg before Göebbels's (p.3-4). The Manageress of the prison, a Catholic lady who was obviously not pro-Nazi, behaved very friendly towards Göebbels's (p.4). Göebbels's passport was confiscated by the Gestapo but after Göebbels's release, on 14 July 1937, Göebbels immediately applied for another, in order to emigrate to some English relatives. Göebbels got Her passport after Christmas and was allowed to take Göebbels's jewels with Göebbels as well as £200. Miss Fellner at Woburn House, helped Göebbels to get permission for some work to do, i.e. translating and interpreting for immigrants. From 1940 - 1943, Göebbels lived in some places in the provinces, where Göebbels gave lessons. Back in London, Göebbels occupied Göebbels with teaching members of the British and American forces who wanted to learn German. 9. Further References : Non-Jews helping Jews (p.4). The Dresdner Bank dismissed Jewish employee after 27 years (p.2). Nine Months In Prison For “Incitement” Name: Lotte Lewin. Place of Birth: Breslau, Silesia, 6th January 1892. Area of residence before emigration: Breslau, Silesia. Profession: In Germany: Languages teacher, Secretary. 1914-17 Secretary for the American consulate. Then librarian for the public library and for the law and political science faculty of the University of Breslau. Religion: Jewish. Father: Businessman, with concerns in the textile industry. He came from the German province of Posen. Died in 1921. Mother: Without profession, the daughter of a Jewish teacher, profession, the daughter of a Jewish teacher also came from the German province of Posen. Died a natural death in 1934. Following inflation, the salary rate at the University of Breslau worsened considerably for Lotte Lewin. So Lotte Lewin decided in the year of 1923 to enter into the textiles business of Lotte Lewin's deceased father, in order to maintain the salary rate at the university for Lotte Lewin's mother. The company, where the Lewins’ warehouse was situated, had, for years, employed a Christian worker, whose loyalty was doubted by no one. a Christian worker, whose loyalty was doubted by no one was, as the correspondent reported, certainly no Anti-Semite and, as a Christian worker, whose loyalty was doubted by no one later testified, what happened was on no account an outcome of malicious intent. At the beginning of the Nazi regime everything relating to the business continued similarly as before, the sales even increased further, and the Christian factory owners showed no signs of Anti-Semitism whatsoever. The Jewish company distributed, amongst other goods, a red fabric, which, even though it was without the swastika symbol, found use as material for flags and much of it was bought by shops. At the beginning of 1936, when Goebbels was supposed to be coming to Breslau, Silesia for an event, Lotte Lewin this quote from Faust to Goebbels as “the spawn of filth and fire” in a private conversation with the Christian employee, who was mentioned above. The young man, who did not know this quote from Faust, appeared to be amused by this quote from Faust and related this quote from Faust to a lady friend, whose brother was in the SA. a lady friend, whose brother was in the SA felt it was probably a lady friend, whose brother was in the SA's duty to report this quote from Faust further to the Gestapo. 6 weeks after the conversation Lotte Lewin was unexpectedly summoned to the Gestapo, who had the Gestapo's main office in the police headquarters. The people there all wore black glasses, which, Lotte Lewin guesses, were probably to arouse yet more fear in the public. No question was asked quietly; Lotte Lewin was only screamed at. Lotte Lewin tried to twist the comment about Göebbels by making it appear as if Goebbels - 2 - had applied this quote to Jews in Goebbels - 2's speech against Jews. Lotte Lewin attempted to make this quote seem like a misunderstanding. Lotte Lewin did not know that the Christian employee, who was mentioned above had been interrogated in a very rough way just before Lotte Lewin. Because of this Lotte Lewin's manoeuvre didn’t help at all and Lotte Lewin went directly, without being able to go home in-between, to a remand prison, where Lotte Lewin stayed for 3 days in solitary confinement. On the second day, as Lotte Lewin was led to cross-examination, the Christian employee, who was mentioned above was present. the Christian employee, who was mentioned above was very cowed and uncertain, as accusations were made against the Christian employee, who was mentioned above, that the Christian employee, who was mentioned above had participated in political discussions with a Jewish lady. They tried to persuade them both that the conversation had been overheard, how the Christian employee, who was mentioned above and Lotte Lewin were suspected because of holes, which Nazi neighbours had supposedly bored into Nazi neighbours's walls. But the whole thing was clearly a trick in order to try and unsettle them. On the third day Lotte Lewin was released. Prior to this Lotte Lewin had to sign a document stating that Lotte Lewin would do nothing against the Reichsregierung and would, in no way, engage Lotte Lewin in politics. Immediately after Lotte Lewin's release- it was currently Passover- Lotte Lewin went to see Lotte Lewin's sister, who Lotte Lewin met with in a synagogue. The husband of Lotte Lewin's sister was later dismissed from the Dresdner Bank (commissioner) after a service of 27 years. Back then in the same year in Breslau, where there was an especially large number of Jewish people living, one generally seemed not to be sufficiently perturbed and viewed the whole matter of the Nazis more as a transitional period. The businesses carried on and so relatively few Jewish people emigrated. “One was more angry than fearful”. Lotte Lewin distinguished Lotte Lewin through a misguided optimism and, following the experience described above, even travelled for Breslau, Silesia to see friends in Czechia, Gräfenberg, for 10 days. Lotte Lewin was warned there against going back to Germany, however Lotte Lewin turned back to go to Breslau, Silesia. Lotte Lewin travelled again in the August of the same year for 3 weeks to Switzerland, where Lotte Lewin stayed until the beginning of September. Because Lotte Lewin owned a passport Lotte Lewin could travel unhindered. From Switzerland, where she stayed until the beginning of September Lotte Lewin wrote to relatives in London about Lotte Lewin's imprisonment, although Lotte Lewin clearly did not see, or did not want to see, the seriousness of the situation. The relatives, who were aware of the German state of affairs, promised Lotte Lewin's security immediately and requested that Lotte Lewin would come to London forthwith. However, Lotte Lewin wanted, for as long as Lotte Lewin had Lotte Lewin's existence, not to emigrate and be a burden to others. - 3 - It was arguably only when, on 1st October 1936, Lotte Lewin received a summons to appear before court on the 14th of October, that Lotte Lewin became deeply conscious of the danger in which Lotte Lewin found Lotte Lewin. Finally, Lotte Lewin now wanted to leave; the ownership of Lotte Lewin's passport would have made that possible, especially as Breslau, Silesia really was not far from Germany's border. Now, however, Lotte Lewin's relatives, Lotte Lewin's brother-in-law and a cousin, insisted on Lotte Lewin's first consulting a lawyer. a lawyer trivialised the issue and pointed out that Lotte Lewin would probably qualify for an amnesty that had recently come out. So Lotte Lewin stayed and went on the 14th of October to Lotte Lewin's court hearing in the “Volksgerichthof”. her court hearing in the “Volksgerichthof” became a secret meeting, all of the attendees- approx. 200 people - had to leave the “Volksgerichthof”. The young man, to whom Lotte Lewin had said the indiscriminate comment about Göebbels, was present as a witness. He reportedly testified under oath that Lotte Lewin was responsible for the indiscriminate comment about Goebbels. Lotte Lewin supposedly stayed with Lotte Lewin's former claim that Lotte Lewin had only quoted the words Göebbels had expressed. The prosecuting attorney sentenced Lotte Lewin to 2 years in jail “because of incitement”. court ultimately agreed on 9 months. Lotte Lewin was immediately led off to prison. Now Lotte Lewin was distraught and reproached Lotte Lewin for not fleeing early enough. Lotte Lewin even wanted to take Lotte Lewin's own life; Lotte Lewin made Lotte Lewin very ill about it. Lotte Lewin's lawyer, who came to visit Lotte Lewin, brought Lotte Lewin back to reason. There was also a Rabbi, Dr Hoffmann, who came to the prison every three weeks and consoled Lotte Lewin. Incidentally, a Rabbi, Dr Hoffmann, who came to the prison every three weeks expressed later that a Rabbi, Dr Hoffmann, who came to the prison every three weeks could always recuperate a little when visiting Lotte Lewin, after a Rabbi, Dr Hoffmann, who came to the prison every three weeks had seen and heard much worse elsewhere, Lotte Lewin's attitude would be so positive. The business was, along with Lotte Lewin's things, disbanded. The manufacturers, who had represented the company of Louis Lewin for more than 50 years, were forced to terminate The manufacturers, who had represented the company of Louis Lewin for more than 50 years's business with Lotte Lewin and Lotte Lewin's associate. As the prison regulations gave the prisoners the right to receive visits from people, who “could help in matters relating to business”; Lotte Lewin's brother-in-law, cousin and associate could come to Lotte Lewin more often. Lotte Lewin was allowed to have other types of visit only every 4 or 6 weeks. For the first 6 weeks of Lotte Lewin's imprisonment, Lotte Lewin lived in a solitary confinement cell. a solitary confinement cell was same one that Rosa Luxemburg had once been within. Like Lotte Lewin, Lotte Lewin fed the birds. Though Lotte Lewin only received insufficient food, there was still more bread than Lotte Lewin could consume. So Lotte Lewin would place Lotte Lewin's - 4 - table beneath the high-up window, then put the chair and a stool on the high-up window, so that Lotte Lewin could climb onto the chair and a stool and then lay the crumbs on the windowsill. The blackbirds quickly grew used to being fed and would come early every day and in the evening and comforted the prisoners with the prisoners's chirping. Atop Lotte Lewin's construction Lotte Lewin could also look out the window: at the Star of David of the nearby Synagogue, at the verdigris roof of the Lewins’ warehouse, also at the courtyard next door, where the male prisoners did the male prisoners's daily walk. Amongst the male prisoners, to Lotte Lewin's utmost horror, Lotte Lewin also sometimes saw familiar faces. An important role was played by the directress of the University of Breslau who visited all of the cells every morning. the directress of the prison who visited all of the cells every morning was a benevolent, understanding lady, a catholic, who, Lotte Lewin felt, showed through the directress of the prison who visited all of the cells every morning's conduct, not through the directress of the prison who visited all of the cells every morning's words, that the directress of the prison who visited all of the cells every morning was not pro-Nazi. With the directress of the prison who visited all of the cells every morning, Lotte Lewin could discuss specific questions and wishes. Above all, Lotte Lewin wanted to have a job; however, this was not possible at that time, for even outside a shortage of work prevailed. Lotte Lewin recommended that Lotte Lewin should occupy Lotte Lewin in the prison library; however, even this was not permissible, as “political offenders” were not allowed to work there and come into contact with other prisoners. the male prisoners were only allowed to write and receive letters once a month. Only “business” was allowed to be sent out more often. However, everything went under the censorship of the directress of the prison who visited all of the cells every morning. Lotte Lewin soon realised, that the directress of the prison who visited all of the cells every morning were not dealing with a real “political prisoner” here and, furthermore, a real “political prisoner” was commended to Lotte Lewin by a friendly outward manner. Because of this Lotte Lewin received special permission to receive letters and write as much as Lotte Lewin wanted. Once, when the Generalstaatsanwalt was supposed to come on an inspection visit, the collection of letters were picked up and kept secure by the directress Lotte Lewin, however, Lotte Lewin got the collection of letters back when Lotte Lewin left the University of Breslau. After three days, Lotte Lewin was made exempt from the “standing to attention” when one’s name was called and one’s “crime” (malicious attacks against the Reichsregierung) identified. “You know how it is done; however, do not forget in the case of an inspection.” The head patrolwoman of the University of Breslau and The head patrolwoman of the prison's young assistants were, in contrast to the directress of the prison who visited all of the cells every morning, extremely coarse and often screamed at the prisoners, - 5 - only one was friendly and nice, she was also a catholic. On the daily walks in single file all conversation was forbidden, still, Lotte Lewin soon learnt to, like the others, talk inaudibly, that is to say without moving her lips, and by these means Lotte Lewin discovered much of Lotte Lewin's fellow prisoners. The prison library contained many good books, even some which were no longer allowed outside under the Nazis, so for example Thomas Mann’s books. Catholic literature was readily available. For Lotte Lewin's study Lotte Lewin busied Lotte Lewin primarily with English literature and German shorthand. Lotte Lewin was also allowed to do needlework, which Lotte Lewin could send to Lotte Lewin's sister every week. One day a man from the Gestapo, also again equipped with black glasses, entered Lotte Lewin's cell and demanded that Lotte Lewin would give in Lotte Lewin's passport. “If her passport is not there within a week, something will happen”. This threat pertained to Lotte Lewin's siblings, who had her passport. The prison Rabbi took it upon The prison Rabbi to warn Lotte Lewin's brother-in-law. And so Lotte Lewin's passport was handed in. On the 14th of July 1937 Lotte Lewin became free. Lotte Lewin's relatives were awaiting Lotte Lewin before the “Volksgerichthof” and it immediately appeared strange to Her relatives how Lotte Lewin behaved anxiously, spoke quietly, looked around timidly. Upon Lotte Lewin's questioning, Lotte Lewin discovered that people from people from their circles who, after being liberated from prison's circles who, after being liberated from prison, had apparently been rearrested and had been brought into KZ. Lotte Lewin soon requested for the issuance of a new passport for the purpose of Lotte Lewin's immigration to London, yet Lotte Lewin only obtained a new passport after Christmas. So Lotte Lewin travelled in August to Bad Kudowa zur Kur. In prison Lotte Lewin had lost 20 lbs during the 9 months. Lotte Lewin had all kinds of afflictions in other ways as well. On the 3rd March Lotte Lewin then immigrated to London. At that time, Lotte Lewin could take £200 and Lotte Lewin's jewellry with Lotte Lewin. Lotte Lewin came on the warrant of her English relatives, with whom Lotte Lewin also initially lived. However, Lotte Lewin did not have a work permit. With the financial aid of Miss Fellner of Woburn House, Lotte Lewin obtained, in June 1938, the approval of the Home Office to work as a translator and interpreter for immigrants who had not mastered German. At the same time Lotte Lewin was strongly involved in getting relatives and friends across, which was something Lotte Lewin attempted for about 20 cases, of which a great deal were successful. In 1940 Lotte Lewin was evacuated to Breslau, Silesia and later to Darlington and supported Lotte Lewin through teaching. In the Summer of 1943 Lotte Lewin returned to London, where Lotte Lewin then gave German classes for the English and American army.

56,"['A personal report by Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin served in the First World War and was a textiles businessman (p.3). In 1941, Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin and Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's 17 year old son were working with Siemens in Lichtenberg. Foreman Hirsch, a non-Nazi, was anxious to help as much as possible Foreman Hirsch, a non-Nazi,'s Jews (special Jewish department); Nazi inspector decent. When taken ill for many weeks Siemens paid Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's wages, plus sickness benefit. In that time when underground with family, Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was invited by ardent anti-Nazi tailor Gustke to Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's cottage at Herrensee near Strausberg. Many helpful German people: slater Palm lent slater Palm's van for removal without a penny, proprietor of a garage, Wolf, supplies the petrol for nothing, etc. (p.4-5), June 1943: flight because of denunciation. Former neighbour in Weissensee Kurt Selig, shelters family for three weeks. In July that time family was arrested and taken to the “Sammellager” (collective camp) for deportation at Grosse Hamburgerstrasse. In August that time Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Soon after Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's wife and 3-year-old daughter were gassed. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin and son were working for the “Bunawerk” (IG Farben) in Monowitz (Auschwitz III), where the son died of pneumonia. From February to June 1940/41 Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was at Camp Dora near Nordhausen where Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin had to be operated on fourteen times without narcosis because of frozen fingers and hand; later arm amputated. 4.

P.III.h. (Auschwitz-Birkenau) No. 198 FRITZ PAGEL: The fate of one individual among many thousands (Recorded by Dr. H.G. Adler, Autumn 1955). I. In Berlin (1933 - 1942) Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was born on 30 November 1895 in Berlin and spent most of Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's life in Berlin. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin enlisted in 1914 to fight in the First World War and was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was taken prisoner by the British in August 1918 and released in October 1919. At the start of the Nazi period in that time Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin had been married for some years and had a nine year-old son, Günther. In 1940 we had a daughter, Judith. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was employed in the ladieswear industry and worked at that time for a company called MOTU, wholesale dealers in dresses and blouses, in Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse). To start with, Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was a travelling salesman, later becoming managing director. Until this point Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin lived in Weissensee, in a house that belonged to the Social Democrats and had been taken over by the German Labour Front (DAF). At this point Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin had to leave a house that belonged to the Social Democrats and had been taken over by the German Labour Front (DAF) and managed to find an apartment in the same district, in a Jewish house in Trarbacherstrasse. After leaving elementary school in 1934, Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's son took up a place at grammar-school but was forced to leave the following year, thereafter attending the Jewish school. In 1935 Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was elected onto the board of the synagogue association of Weissensee. Up until the start of 1943 services were held by Rabbi Heinz MAYER, until Rabbi Heinz MAYER was sent to Theresienstadt. In the autumn of 1944 Rabbi Heinz MAYER died in Auschwitz. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's father died in 1937 in Berlin. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's mother, brother and sister escaped to London during the first half of 1939 and still live there today. In 1937/38 a company called MOTU, wholesale dealers in dresses and blouses, in Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse) had a substantial turnover. Günther and I lived and worked unmolested until the November catastrophe of 1938. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin spent the evening of 9 November playing skat. On Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's way home, there was unrest on the streets. The following morning Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin went to Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's work premises on the fifth floor of a building in Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse). On the way Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin noticed that shops had been vandalised and people were throwing rolls of fabric out of windows onto the street. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin sent the Christian staff away and instructed the Jewish employees to remain inside a building in Mohrenstrasse and Günther and I barricaded Günther and I in. Nazis tried to break in but couldn’t get to Günther and I. Apart from Günther and I's premises, Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin doubt if there was a single Jewish business in the street that escaped this orgy of destruction. In the evening Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin hurried home to Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse), but then immediately returned to Mohrenstrasse where Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin spent three days and nights together with Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's brother, who was also hiding there. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin then ventured home once more. No-one had come looking for Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin. Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse) seemed to have remained relatively unscathed. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's boss Hugo Schloss, who hadn’t hidden in the shop, fell into the hands of the German Labour Front (DAF) at My boss Hugo Schloss, who hadn’t hidden in the shop's apartment and ended up in Nordhausen. My boss Hugo Schloss, who hadn’t hidden in the shop asked Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin to liquidate the company, so Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin sold the stock for cash at rock-bottom prices. My boss Hugo Schloss, who hadn’t hidden in the shop was released from the Nazi period at the end of December and Günther and I completed the liquidation process together in January 1939. Being unable to work, Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin lived off Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's assets until December 1940. During this time Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin tried to organise the emigration of a - 2 - group of people to Argentina. the emigration of a - 2 - group of people to Argentina was a project designed to save 100 families. The idea was for 30 people to club together to raise the sum of 5 million Reichsmark, but The idea failed because no-one was prepared to commit the necessary funds. a - 2 - group of people were later killed. The Jewish Aid Association also refused to get involved, describing the whole business as a sham. In 1939 Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's son was taken on as an apprentice in an ironmonger’s. In the winter of 1940/41 the labour exchange forced my son to work clearing snow from the streets. In 1941 my son tried for a job with Siemens &amp; Halske. my son was successful and was taken on as an unskilled labourer. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin suggested Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin apply as well. Günther and I were both assigned to a special “Jewish Department” in Lichtenberg, Möllendorfstrasse. A total of around 50 - 60 men and women aged between 16 - 60 worked there under a Christian foreman named Hirsch who was not a Nazi and tried, as far as the situation allowed, to make things easier for the Jews – all unskilled workers at the beginning. Even the Nazi guard behaved decently towards the Jews – all unskilled workers at the beginning. At the start, working-hours were from 7am to 6pm with a 45-minute break. Later there was a day shift and a night shift. A total of around 50 - 60 men and women aged between 16 - 60 were given papers which allowed A total of around 50 - 60 men and women aged between 16 - 60 to come and go, and to drive. Sundays were free. In addition, workers were entitled to twelve unpaid days off a year. Günther and I were trained as grinders, turners and millers, and also learned how to operate the drilling and punching machines; Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin and Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin were put to work at a lathe. On the whole Günther and I adapted incredibly well, and quickly, to this new and unfamiliar work. During the four weeks’ training Günther and I were paid around 35 RM a week gross, then Günther and I moved on to piecework. From Günther and I's nominal wage of 48 RM Günther and I lost 15 RM in deductions for general taxes, health insurance and the so-called “Jewish tax”. This meant Günther and I only received 33 RM which was in practice the maximum you could earn, because so many regular deductions were made from this nominally higher wage that you still ended up with just 33 RM. As a result Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin used to calculate the amount of piecework Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin completed so that Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin earned a nominal wage of exactly 48 RM. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin suffered for a while from oil acne and was well provided for under the Siemens insurance scheme; Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin even received the sick pay to which Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was entitled. All was as it should be. After nine months or so Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's son and Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin were the only ones in Günther and I's group to be trained as machine setters. Günther and I's job was to ensure the smooth running of the individual machines. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin remained on the same wage as before, however, as Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was not interested in a nominal increase. In the autumn of 1940/41 the German Labour Front (DAF) started putting Polish civilian workers in with Günther and I in the Jewish department and Günther and I had to train Polish civilian workers up. One lunchtime Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was chatting with friends and said: “Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin have a feeling that one day all the Jewish departments will be closed down and all the Jews will be taken away. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin don’t want to be amongst all the Jews”. II. Living illegally (January to July 1940/41) At no. 8 Trierstrasse lived a men’s tailor named GUSTKE with a men’s tailor named GUSTKE's wife and children. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin knew very well that a men’s tailor named GUSTKE was anti-Nazi. a men’s tailor named GUSTKE used to listen to foreign radio and always kept Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin abreast of any news. a men’s tailor named GUSTKE was an ex-soldier and now too old for military service, which is why the German Labour Front (DAF) employed a men’s tailor named GUSTKE as a Schupo (member of the security police). On a visit to a men’s tailor named GUSTKE one day Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin told a men’s tailor named GUSTKE of Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's fears. a men’s tailor named GUSTKE replied: “Well. a men’s tailor named GUSTKE’m sure a men’s tailor named GUSTKE know where a men’s tailor named GUSTKE are headed, Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin”. a men’s tailor named GUSTKE owned a piece of land and a cottage in Herrensee near Straussberg, and a men’s tailor named GUSTKE declared - 3 - a men’s tailor named GUSTKE happy for Günther and I to this work use of a piece of land and a cottage in Herrensee near Straussberg. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's wife was prepared to accept a men’s tailor named GUSTKE's offer and Günther and I set to thinking how Günther and I could make this work. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin decided first of all to continue working at Siemens until Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's holiday which was scheduled for the period 26 December 1942 - 2 January 1943. Günther and I settled on 2 January as the day of Günther and I's escape. Once Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's holiday had started Günther and I began moving essential items such as bed-linen and clothes etc. from Günther and I's apartment to a men’s tailor named GUSTKE's place. This had to be done secretly, under cover of darkness. As Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's holiday was due to finish, Günther reported sick so that Günther could join Günther and I in Günther and I's escape. A roofer from Weissensee, Herr Palm, with whom Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin had been in contact – Günther planned to take in Günther and I's daughter, Judith, and hide our daughter, Judith – gave Günther and I the use of Günther's truck for Günther and I's escape and Günther and I's local garage-owner, a man named WOLF, gave Günther and I free petrol. Early in the morning on 2 January 1943, Günther left a men’s tailor named GUSTKE's place in Günther's truck along with Günther and all Günther and I's belongings. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's wife took our daughter, Judith with his wife and the two of Frau Gustke and I travelled by train. Frau Gustke and Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin were also on train but sat away from the others. It was still early morning when Frau Gustke and I arrived at Frau Gustke and I's destination, deep snow lay on the ground. his truck got stuck in the road so the owner of a haulage company provided Frau Gustke and I with somewhere to store Frau Gustke and I's things. Günther returned to Berlin in Günther's truck, and Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin turned up with two hand sledges. The next day Günther and Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin went out with a cart to collect Frau Gustke and I's belongings, for whose safekeeping the woman from a haulage company refused to take any payment. the woman from the haulage company also returned to Berlin on that first evening. the woman from the haulage company's cottage stood among a group of grand dwellings in what had been woodland, an hour and a half’s walk from Straussberg. Frau Gustke and I settled in as best Frau Gustke and I could. the woman from the haulage company had given Frau Gustke and I two or three hundredweight of coal. Even the question of food had been sorted. At Frau Gustke and I's apartment in Trarbacherstrasse Frau Gustke and I had had to give up a room so that a room could be used by a Jewish man with a Christian wife. On Frau Gustke and I's last day in Berlin Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin told them both of Frau Gustke and I's intention to go into hiding and asked the woman from the haulage company to let Frau Gustke and I have four weeks’ worth of food coupons. the woman from the haulage company refused. But Frau Gustke and I got by without their help. The Gustkes came to see Frau Gustke and I every weekend and brought food. Sometimes Frau Gustke and I obtained more food by trading in some of Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's wife’s clothes to a woman who was head of a branch of Meyer. a woman who was head of a branch of Meyer was a respectable businesswoman who always gave Frau Gustke and I food without asking for coupons and only ever charged Frau Gustke and I the proper official price for other goods. Frau Gustke and I were also given bread, again without coupons and at a ridiculously low price, by a baker in Trarbacherstrasse called MAYER. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin and Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin took it in turns to pick it up when Frau Gustke and I went into town. However, Frau Gustke and I's diet consisted mainly of potatoes and sour skimmed milk which Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was given by a farmer in a neighbouring village in exchange for work. a farmer in a neighbouring village had no idea who Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was. The Gustkes never took a single penny for all that The Gustkes did for Frau Gustke and I. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin kept The Gustkes's property in good order and tidied up The Gustkes's untended garden. One of Frau Gustke and I's neighbours, a friend of The Gustkes, suspected that there was something not right about Frau Gustke and I, but said nothing. a men’s tailor named GUSTKE's wife was of Lorrainian origin and therefore had French sympathies, whereas a men’s tailor named GUSTKE's mother was high up in the National Socialist Women’s League. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin also tended a men’s tailor named GUSTKE's garden and a men’s tailor named GUSTKE paid Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin with generous amounts of food. Also neighbours were the WOLFF family, who – unfortunately – Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's son befriended. In the woman from the haulage company's earlier years the woman from the haulage company had worked as a servant for a Jewish family and the woman from the haulage company became suspicious of Frau Gustke and I living there under the name of a baker in Trarbacherstrasse called MAYER and without any papers. - 4 - One day the Women’s League leader said to Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin: “the woman from the haulage company maintains that Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin are Jews, but Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin told the woman from the haulage company that can’t be true because a baker in Trarbacherstrasse called MAYER read the “Völkischer Beobachter”. In response Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin threatened legal action, but the woman from the haulage company talked Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin out of legal action. Halske was having a well dug on Halske's land, and the well-builder took Günther and Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin on as unskilled labourers, without demanding any papers. Helping Günther and I was a 15 year-old Russian Ostarbeiter (forced labourer from the East). Günther and I were paid 2.60 Reichsmarks an hour and the work took about four weeks. And so the months went past and life was tolerable, until one Sunday in June 1940/41 the Gustkes and Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin decided to go into the woods to look for strawberries. On Günther and I's return Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's wife told Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin that a police officer had called, asking for Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin and Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's son. Apparently a police officer had said: “Don’t take this the wrong way, but are Günther and I sure Günther and I’re not Jewish?” Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's wife denied it and a police officer went away, but not before a police officer had asked for a men’s tailor named GUSTKE to come and speak to a police officer that afternoon. a men’s tailor named GUSTKE duly went along, returning with the message that a police officer wanted to see both Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's and Günther employment records within the next 8 days. This ominous change in Günther and I's fortunes came as a result of Frau Gustke and I's sycophantic and malevolent neighbour Frau Wolff’s loose tongue. On the following Friday night Günther and I set off for Berlin Ostkreuz station with just a few essential items to Günther and I's name, arriving early the next morning. Günther and I had no idea what to do next, but then Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin remembered a phone number Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin had been given. In summer 1942 Günther and I had had a visit from one Kurt SELIG and one Kurt SELIG's wife and daughter. one Kurt SELIG and his wife and daughter had lived in the same house as Günther and I in Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse) for many years and wanted to know how Günther and I were doing. As one Kurt SELIG and his wife and daughter left, one Kurt SELIG had said: “If you ever find yourself in difficulty and need one Kurt SELIG's help, just remember one Kurt SELIG's number – but don’t write a phone number I had been given down”. So Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin phoned the Seligs, who lived by then – as the Seligs, who lived by then – as they still do today - in Werner Voss Damm 20, Tempelhof still do today - in Werner Voss Damm 20, Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse). Frau Gustke and I were given a warm welcome and food to eat, for which one Kurt SELIG and his wife and daughter refused payment. If one Kurt SELIG had to leave Gustke’s place early, one Kurt SELIG would leave Frau Gustke and I 20 cigarettes. Unfortunately, staying with one Kurt SELIG and his wife and daughter was not a long-term solution as it was too cramped, so after 3 weeks Günther and I had to leave a house that belonged to the Social Democrats and had been taken over by the German Labour Front (DAF). Günther and I's son was able to stay with friends while Günther and I moved around without any fixed abode, even camping out in Grunewald forest at one point. Whenever Günther and I were all together in the street Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin would always make Günther keep Günther's distance from Günther and I. III. From Berlin to Monowitz (July 1943) Günther and I continued to lead this precarious nomadic life until the beginning of July 1943 when Günther and I were stopped near Berlin town-hall by a plain-clothes police inspector, the arrest and taken to the transit camp in Grosse Hamburgerstrasse. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's son, who had witnessed the arrest, was able to escape unnoticed. It being Saturday afternoon there were no SS in the transit camp in Grosse Hamburgerstrasse, so Günther and I escaped interrogation and punishment. Günther and I were given a room and decent food. At that point there were around 200 prisoners in the transit camp in Grosse Hamburgerstrasse, mostly people in the same situation as Günther and I, i.e. had attempted to live illegally. Many of Günther and I knew of Jewish informants living in the transit camp in Grosse Hamburgerstrasse, including a Dr. JACOBSOHN. Dr Jacobsohn, who had practised in Schönhauser Strasse, thought his underhand dealings would mean his family - 5 - would be saved, but in the end he went down the same route as all the others and was gassed at Auschwitz. These informants roamed the streets during the day, without wearing the obligatory Star of David, intent on catching Jewish-looking passers-by. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin recognised a former patient of Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's, a dyed blonde, and handed a former patient of his, a dyed blonde over to the police. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin had no choice but to take a former patient of his, a dyed blonde to Grosse Hamburgerstrasse, saying to a former patient of his, a dyed blonde on the way: “What pigs they are! But unfortunately Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin can’t let a former patient of his, a dyed blonde go, otherwise Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin’ll end up in prison Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin”. One day a Jewish man at the assembly point threw a Jewish man at the assembly point out of a third-floor window and landed in the middle of the street. One evening three days after Frau Gustke and I's arrival, the doors opened and Frau Gustke and I's son entered the room. My son, who had witnessed the arrest had handed My son, who had witnessed the arrest in. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was beside Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin and remonstrated loudly with My son, who had witnessed the arrest, but in the end Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin held Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's tongue when My son, who had witnessed the arrest explained: “Papa, where Papa go, My son, who had witnessed the arrest go.” Those who were capable were put to work, but only the men. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was assigned to a group responsible for preparing the building occupied by the Higher Institute for Jewish Studies in Artillerie Strasse for use by the German Labour Front (DAF); Günther and I did all the painting. While Frau Gustke and I were there it was often possible to get away for a time and so Frau Gustke and I could meet up with Frau Selig, who brought Frau Gustke and I cigarettes. During those evenings Frau Gustke and I kept Frau Gustke and I entertained by playing cards etc. At the beginning of August 1943, a transport was put together of 99 men, women and children – the youngest was just 6 months old – and Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was put in charge. Frau Gustke and I took food for everybody - Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin recall it consisted of two loaves of bread per person - plus Frau Gustke and I took flour and salt. Frau Gustke and I had heard that every time a transport arrived at Auschwitz from Berlin there was bread soup to eat. Early in the morning on 3 August, Frau Gustke and I were taken on trucks to a station – it might have been Jungfernheide. At the same time Goebbels had issued an order that Christian hospitals were to be evacuated because of air attacks. The entire transport and Christian hospitals's luggage were loaded into two closed cattle trucks which were then coupled to a passenger train bound for Silesia. The accompanying SS officers travelled separately. One of the wagons remained locked throughout the journey, the other was opened at certain stations. One of the wagons contained all those who had attempted to escape, including many who had fled from prison camps - even Auschwitz. While in the transit camp these absconders were held in a cell and had to be taken to the toilet by guards. Frau Gustke and I's two wagons were uncoupled in Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse) and then taken on to Birkenau, where Günther and I arrived at about 8 o’clock in the evening. Günther and I were met by SS who told Günther and I Günther and I were being taken to a labour camp – more details were not forthcoming. Günther and I were made to clean out the wagons and then Günther and I were loaded onto trucks and taken to a former stable in a labour camp. Here Günther and I stayed all together until around 11pm. Günther and I were then led out in two columns, men in one and women and children in the other, and told to move towards a truck with a truck with its headlights blazing's headlights blazing. Between two columns, men in one and women and children in the other stood an SS officer. The men sent left and the women sent right were being despatched to The men sent left and the women sent right's deaths. Those left behind numbered around 20 - 25 men and … women. The men, women and children selected were taken off to a red building. The following day Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin learned that this was the gas chamber. Among - 6 - those poor victims were Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's wife and Günther and I's little Judith. Once the selection process was over, those of Günther and I were taken to a barrack where Günther and I were made to undress. Günther and I were ordered to file past an SS officer with Günther and I's arms above Günther and I's heads and fingers apart, during which Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's wedding ring was removed. Günther and I were then taken to the sauna block and forced under the shower, before having Günther and I's heads and all other bodily hair shaved off. Günther and I were then herded into a large hall where Günther and I's personal details were recorded and we each had our prisoner number tattooed into Günther and I's left arm. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's number was 135396. Günther and I were issued with civilian clothing, a jacket and trousers but no underwear, and not even basic wooden clogs or a hat. In this miserably inadequate get-up Günther and I looked like the worst kind of criminals. It took all night to get through this whole process. At around dawn Günther and I were taken to Frau Gustke and I's accommodation block where they left Günther and I in peace for the rest of that first day. The following morning Günther and I were taken off, barefoot as Günther and I were, to man the tipper trucks at the sauna block. Günther and I were not mistreated, but Günther and I saw girls - also in their bare feet - having to drag ten heavy bricks at a time and being beaten all the while by SS women with canes. A few days later, a call went out from the Bunawerk factory in Monowitz (Auschwitz) for carpenters, mechanics, lathe operators and other skilled workers. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin and Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin applied to work as lathe operators. Altogether Günther and I took on around 100 men, 15 of whom had arrived on the same transport as Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin. Günther and I took Günther and I first of all to Auschwitz, where Günther and I were bathed, disinfected and kitted out with the now familiar “zebra suit”. This time Günther and I were also given undergarments, a cap and a pair of wooden clogs. the German Labour Front (DAF) then marched Günther and I on foot to Monowitz (Auschwitz III), keeping Günther and I in line with blows from the German Labour Front (DAF)'s rifle butts. Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's feet were soon rubbed raw from the ill-fitting shoes, hence Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's decision to walk most of the route in bare feet. IV. Monowitz (Auschwitz III) (August 1943 - January 1945) On arrival in Monowitz (Auschwitz III) Günther and I were once again put through the whole bathing and dressing procedure, as it seemed to be the custom for prisoners to have to wear different things after every bath. Günther and I were quartered in a vast tent fitted out with hundreds of triple bunks. Everything was scrupulously clean but Günther and I were not welcome, as so-called “preventive detention (SV) prisoners” ruled the roost and so-called “preventive detention (SV) prisoners” treated Günther and I badly. After about two days, Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin was admitted to the hospital suffering from enteritis and so was separated from Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's son. Even after Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's discharge, a further three days went by without Fritz Pagel, born in 1895 in Berlin's seeing my son. But when one of the work details was in need of mechanics Günther and I put Günther and I forward, and so were reunited. a company called MOTU, wholesale dealers in dresses and blouses, in Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse) was led by a Kapo called Erich and was made up of between 50 and 60 men, mostly Polish Jews and some German Jews. a company called MOTU, wholesale dealers in dresses and blouses, in Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse) was known for a company called MOTU, wholesale dealers in dresses and blouses, in Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse)'s cleanliness. a Kapo called Erich men were expected to keep Erich’s men scrupulously clean and tidy, but a Kapo called Erich took good care of Erich’s men. On joining a company called MOTU, wholesale dealers in dresses and blouses, in Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse) Günther and I were moved into decent barracks. The block elder was a decent Polish Jew. The block elder was particularly kind to Günther, giving Günther extra helpings - 7 - of food over a period of many weeks to keep Günther in good health. Furthermore, a Kapo called Erich also made sure there was always sufficient food. a Kapo called Erich managed this because, in addition to Günther and I's work detail, there were also musicians living in Günther and I's barracks, who enjoyed special status. Among musicians living in our barracks, who enjoyed special status were Poles, Germans and Dutchmen; the choirmaster was a gypsy, who was also an excellent violinist. Günther and I spent several months in a company called MOTU, wholesale dealers in dresses and blouses, in Kronenstrasse (later Mohrenstrasse), until one time Günther and I were caught “organising” (i.e. stealing) bread. a Kapo called ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

als were packed. Large amounts of luggage were forbidden. Now came the farewell! Herr Granaat promised his mother that he would visit her the following day in Schouwberg. The officials advised him to apply for a permit. One of them said: “I’ll carry your luggage for you!” The other said: “Come mother! You can support yourself on my arm! It’s dark on the street! We have a car from the ‘green’ police.., Günther was then moved to a much tougher Kommando, I’m gad that you don’t have to go on foot at least!” At the time, Amsterdam was full of placards saying ‘Trains roll for victory!’ Was the extermination of the Jews what this meant…., it was, thus, no empty sentence! I never saw the old Frau Granaat again. Herr Granaat did everything possible to secure her release from Schouwberg. I cannot guess what ways and means he used. He probably, like so many thousands of others, went from one office to another and one influential official to another. Many succeeded at the time in freeing their imprisoned relatives from Schouwberg; many were even ‘exempt’ from this first step on their journey of suffering. Herr Granaat was not so lucky! The winter of 1942/43 was cruel. Everywhere a lack of everything prevailed. The end of the war was not in sight. There was presumably scarcely a Jew who doubted that the Germans would be defeated after the blows suffered by the Germans in Africa and Russia…, yet many doubted they would see the peace. Like wildfire, news spread of the deportations of the occupants of hospitals and orphanages; of childrens’ homes and those of the elderly. The more frequent the raids became, the ever greater became the number of those in ‘hiding’. Were you to speak of friends and acquaintances, there was constant mention of being ‘hidden’…, Westerbork, Vught, Amersfoort, Germany (Poland was seldom mentioned); apprehended, fled, shot dead etc. Opposite the college of manual crafts, which I attended in the Jewish quarter, in Rapenburgerstraat, was the Israelite Orphanage for Girls. Were one of the girls no longer to attend the college, then you knew…, they had disappeared; whether into Westerbork or ‘in hiding’. From this time at college, two things are particularly memorable to me. The trade in cigarettes and bread tokens and the tense, yet rather cool indifference that my classmates displayed towards the daily terror. My classmates came mostly from an industrial village (the industrial village was Hachscharah founded in 1933). Those boys of the same age or even older than me were, so far as being refugees from Germany and Austria, calmer and more composed by far, than the boys, who were kept at home by their parents.., which is only natural. As many from the village and Chaluzin were in Westerbork, it seemed to me the normal course of things that you found yourself, likewise, in Westerbork. The camaraderie, which lifted the morale of the individual, was so much more lacking in me, the ever worse the situation became. Later, I viewed my isolation from this shared fate as tragic. During this time, I often went to the house in Franselaan Plantagenate, which was only five minutes away from Rapenburgerstraat. It was kind of a Kibbuz, almost exclusively occupied by the residents of the industrial village. I had a friend and many acquaintances there, who came with me from Vienna to Holland. They all planned to go into hiding, yet the prospect of going to Westerbork was the most terrible idea. I learnt that Dr Litten from Gouda, who was in hiding, had lost his nerves and had been taken away to Westerbork. After the war, I heard that his wife succeeded in getting him out of there. He, however, refused to try such a test of nerves once more; his wife, however, followed him to Westerbork. They were deported and never returned from Auschwitz, whilst their son, Gideon, remained hidden with Farmers and, today, lives in Israel. The flood of raids continued…, yet, by some miracle, I was always spared. On the day that the Green Police took the Franselaans’ to Westerbork, I was at home. Many of those from the industrial village fled at the last moment. On the 10th February 1943, it was the turn of the girl from the orphanage in Rapenburgerstraat…; only a few of the children and nurses were allowed to remain behind. Two days later, Cilly Levitus moved into our house in Nierstraat from Frankfurt. She worked opposite the Schouwberg in the crêche; one of the childrens’ and infants’ homes run by the Dutch Jewish Council. Those acquainted with Cilly were to become of considerable significance to me. I was, at that time, 16 and she was 17 years old. Within this period of general nervousness and tumult, which had gripped everyone, Cilly was unconcerned, lively, happy and loved her work with the babies in the crêche and had an uplifting word for everybody. My self confidence (basically, nothing more than a huge hidden anxiety, which bore this rigid, unbending self-certainty) as well as Cilly’s vitality, had the effect that we both got on really well. Whenever I lost hope at the sight of people, who, like hunted game, ran through the streets or were shoved into wagons like cattle, she comforted me by saying ‘Chin up!!’ or ‘Don’t look so sad!!’ The city and its people around me were so shabby and down-trodden, that I pondered upon the dirty streets of Vienna of March to December 1938, where I witnessed the same general nervousness and anxiety. After Vienna, Holland appeared like an island of peace and well-being to me and it was inconceivable that poverty and destruction would also come to Amsterdam. To see the city overrun by the German Army and the SS was a bad dream. In Spring 1943, it became clear that the ‘exemption stamp’ had lost its validity. Panic spread! In March or April, the Jews in Rivierenbuurt, to which the Nierstraat belonged, had to move into the ghettos in the old Jodenbuurt and within the east of the city, into the Afrikaanderbuurt. The Granaat family (without the then given-up non-Jewish child) had to resettle with the child, Cilly, from Germany and me into a 3 bedroom apartment on the third floor of Retiefstraat 39. In comparison to Nierstraat, Retiefstraat was, with its four storey brick buildings, shabby. We could almost take all of the furniture with us. I took the unusable Dutch ID Card, which Rob had given to me and hid it under the linoleum of the dining room. In the meantime, the school in Rapenburgerstraat had been closed. You were allowed to leave the quarter and go to the outskirts of the city, but could not use any form of public transport. Many non-Jewish people lived within our street, as well as the neighbouring streets. There was also no hostility from them as we had experienced in Vienna, but you did notice that you no longer had a shared common fate. Whether they too suffered under the Germans, they did not have to fight with the constant fear of being taken away by the Germans. The walls were strewn with all kinds of proclamations. Those proclamations having anything to do with the wearers of the yellow star of David, were demands made of the Jews e.g. that all those with the initials A-K go on such-and-such-a-day at this particular time with 30kg of luggage to Polderweg. Polderweg was only 5 minutes away from Retiefstraat. I repeatedly witnessed families meeting on this open building site with all their worldly goods. These people hung around; the elderly, children and the tired huddled between the luggage. Lorries of the Green and the Dutch police drove up, ID Cards were checked; mostly by extremely young Dutchmen and everything took place in an air of calm and in a relaxed manner, as though they were going on a trip in a big ship with everyone having to wait their turn. It was a time of waiting. As ever fewer people obeyed the calls, the raids became ever more frequent. You waited to be taken away. My decision to disappear was resolute, but I still had no usable Dutch ID card. At Hermonystraat 20, a branch of the Hechaluz was still running, which was the next available connection with the ‘resistance’. Here, Chaluzim were helped to obtain false documents. The leaders were German half-Jews, Kurt Reilinger, who did not have to wear the yellow star of David patch and Gideon Drach (Reilinger was run over and killed on a country road after the war. Drach lives today on a Kibbuz in Israel). I went there; it was not very busy. I think I spoke to Reilinger. As you needed a photo, I got my hair cut really short, in order to emphasise more of my non-Jewish appearance. I was very concerned about Cilly and was able to get a Dutch ID card for her as well, even though she did not belong to any Alijah group. A week later, I had to find Drach, who lived in a non-Jewish apartment in Nierstraat 53, so that I could conclude the matter. I had to take fl.300 with me, as it was necessary to bribe the clerk of registrations. Not only that, but the underground movement needed money, as they constantly suffered from a lack of supplies. Yet, paying this sum was not an absolute condition; they would have given me the rescuing ID card even without the fl.300, which my uncle Louis gave me. Cilly, thus, got her ID card, if I remember rightly, for no more than fl.50. It was already June 1943, when we got our ID cards. On the 27th May, the last big raid took place. Hardly a Jew could be seen on the streets; yet hundreds of families still lived in Afrikaanerbuurt. Even in the Stadionbuurt, there were a few Jewish families. Those, who hadn’t been collected, were soon collected; there was no doubt in this. In any case, it was high time to disappear! At the same time as I received the Dutch ID card, (I became Johan Gerit Overbeek, born in Aalten, Gelderland on the 7th January 1926), I was given the address of a Farmer in Jutphaas near Utrecht, to whom I was to go. In addition, food tokens were also given to me for a month. I had to sign the Dutch ID card myself (the one from Rob already had a signature on it). It seemed a reliable document. It was so good, that I could not make out where it was forged and they did not tell me either. I presume that the number had been altered, but that was unthinkable, as you had nothing to fear at the roadside check. So, I had everything in order now…, the adventure could begin. And, quicker than expected, it began in earnest three days later on Sunday 20th June 1943. This radiant summer’s day was judgment day on which Amsterdam was to be made ‘clean of Jews’. Whosoever wanted to remain was either a higher functionary of the Dutch Jewish Council, Portuguese, in a mixed-marriage, sterilised or an ‘honorary Aryan’ etc. At 7 o’clock in the morning, it was announced via loudspeaker, that every Jewish family had to assemble on the streets with their baggage; housing was to be closed down. Those who did not comply or who were found after the operation, or who had tried to escape were threatened with incarceration in a prison camp. The end had begun! The police cars with the loudspeakers drove on into other streets. It remained strangely quiet in our area. The baggage stood packed. I decided to disappear at the last moment, but with things, as they were, I did not know how. I did not say anything to the Granaats’; it would have been pointless. Cilly had already gone into hiding at the house of the lady she knew. I knew the address by heart. Cilly told me to go when things got urgent. It became hot that day. In the blue skies above, high-flying American bombers drew white plumes. The Flak hammered away for a short time, but fell silent after a few minutes. The air-raid warning did not sound. I went for short walks to strategically reconnoitre the area around the quarter. The situation seemed hopeless, police and SS were standing at all important points. Yet, I could still hope, that they would not come into our street today. Already, by the 27th of May, it looked equally threatening and against all expectation, they did not appear. The afternoon dragged on endlessly. We were too excited to eat anything. The Jews sat like birds in a cage in their homes or walked restlessly from their homes. At any moment, the lorry could come! When I went into the Hachscharah home in Gouda, Uncle Louis had bought me a pair of high black riding boots and a pair of green jodhpurs, which I now wore as well as a dark shirt with a black tie. Then, I had a jacket without a star; there was never one sewn into it and that is important, as it had not yet occurred that the seam or a light discolouration had given the game away. Finally, I also owned a floppy grey hat with a fold-down brim. I looked at myself in the mirror…, I looked like the epitome of a Gestapo officer.., but just a bit younger. My beard growth was modest; I haven’t yet got to grow a moustache. A moustache would have been good, but I just could not whistle one up!! In any case, I practised pushing my lower lip forward, surreptitiously, but enough to give my face an austere expression. Then, I had something even more important for my disguise……., a Dutch Nazi Party badge! I did not, however, pin it on.., I just left it open on the upper pocket of my clothing. It could be pinned on in a second, but I still did not know how to disappear with it. I still did not trust myself to go into the procession of people on the streets, as the Jews and non-Jews would have recognised me. Things would have become very unpleasant!! I had to wait for darkness to fall. I had a vague plan…, in the most compelling of cases, I would jump onto the footboard of a car alongside the driver and jump off somewhere within the city. I only hoped that it would be possible for our turn to come as late as possible, at least after the beginning of the twilight hours. We waited impatiently on events. Around 5 o’clock in the morning, we could hear the cars at the far end of the street. If you looked out of the window, then you could see the procession of cars, ‘blacks’ and the captive Jews. The crying, wailing, ordering, jangling of cups and cooking utensils, which were attached to rucksacks, dragged itself along the pavement. A few curious things now happened. The Granaat family went up into the attic, where a large furnished hiding place was hidden behind a wall. There was already a family of seven from Rumania there; I hadn’t yet seen them and had absolutely no idea that they lived in this house. The Granaat family did not tell me a thing about this hiding place, perhaps to avoid the eventuality that I would want to bring one of my many acquaintances. We sat, eleven or twelve of us under the roof tiles and could hear every sound from the street. Now, I experienced something unknown to me; Herr Granaat and his wife had obtained false Dutch ID documents and even addresses, so that they could go into hiding. They wanted to do it, as soon as the raid was over. We sat with bowed heads and barely dared to breathe. Now, it was the turn of the neighbouring houses.., the noises and lamentations became ever louder. Retiefstraat 39 is a corner-house at a crossroads, so that at least on one side, no side roof adjoined it. Now, I made the resolute decision, to escape through the skylight. Initially, I wasn’t able to move at first, as the slightest noise would have betrayed us. Herr Granaat and his wife sat their ash-grey; their faces towards the attic floor. We could hear voices and the sound of the boots of the police in the house; the knocking and pulling at the door too!! And now something strange happened…; I believed that the noise in the house had already died down, as, one after the other, I do not know who was first, stood up, packed their baggage and went through the door, down the staircase to the lorries awaiting them. No-one looked around, no-one spoke a word, but I sat cowering in a corner and watched. What could I have said? They had made their decision…, I remained silent! Exploiting the noise on the staircase, I climbed through the skylight. I only had the jacket with me; the rest I’d forgotten and left behind in the apartment. Night was already falling heavily, but it was not quite dark. I crept across the roof tiles and laid myself outstretched behind a chimney, with my boots in front of me. That the police had left the block, naturally did not mean, that no more patrols would follow. They would certainly have found me, if someone had climbed through the skylight after me. Had they have only looked out of the skylight, I would have been discovered. I believed that nobody would assume that anyone would be in the house or on the roof. After all, the doors had been locked! A patrol from the neighbouring houses would certainly have come upon me. I lay face-down on the roof tiles and was allowed to hope, that someone, who could only see my boots, would believe I was a policeman. The noise on the street continued. The darker it became, the better my chances became, not to be discovered. I also believed that, after a long work day, nobody from the tired houses would take the trouble to climb over the rooves. In such moments, which drew on like hours, you barely thought of anything, or only of the most trivial things. Later, in Germany, particularly during the air raids, I often felt like this. At this point in time, no-one came onto the roof. All of a sudden, however, a torch shone from one of the rooves on the houses opposite. The light was not strong and lasted only a few hours; I believed that they would have been able to see me. The noise slowly ebbed away on the streets; one car after another drove away. Even the crying of the children and the rattling of the cooking utensils had silenced. I could breathe a sigh of relief. For a long time, however, I still did not trust going downstairs. Someone could have been in the apartment and I still had to guard against non-Jewish neighbours in some of the back yards. It became rather cold. All around it was quite dark; only the sky stayed too light as if the moon had appeared. I lay on my back and wanted, at least, to wait until after midnight, only then would I trust myself to go downstairs. As there was no sign of noise anywhere, and thinking that everyone was asleep, I crept to the edge of the roof by the back yard. I could see the kitchen door at the balcony of the apartment of the Granaat family. In order to get there, I had to work my way over the balconies to the third floor. How I managed to do this, I no longer know, but, somehow, I balanced on the gutters and struts to the right balcony. I had hoped that the kitchen doors would be open, but they were locked from inside; even the windows were locked. I spent no time thinking about it and bashed an elbow against the glass in the door. The glass smashed! Exactly opposite in the courtyard a light came on and somewhat further down another came on. I ducked down. I do not know to this day whether I had been seen or not. I kept still and the lights went out again. I opened the door and stood in the kitchen. With some effort, I took my boots off; my legs hurt! I had to be as quiet as possible. I had a ravenous hunger. There were peas in a pan on the stove. I ate until I felt sick; then lay down in my room, but not on my bed, out of fear of falling asleep; I rather did so on the floor. I needed to disappear as soon as possible in the morning. Initially, I wanted to ascertain whether my sister was still in Amsterdam and, afterwards, I would inquire when trains ran to Utrecht. It did not seem advisable to wait for long periods at a time at railway stations. I left the apartment, after a rather restless sleep lasting 3 hours. The doors were not locked and I had a key. I needed to go back in the afternoon or early evening to collect my baggage. It was not recommended to be seen on the streets. Baggage was always suspicious. I went to the tram-stop; it was still early, workers and employees were on their way to work. In order to avoid any ugly scenes, I put on the Dutch Nazi Party badge. As soon as the Dutch people on the tram saw it, they all fell silent and would rather have spat at me. For the first time in my life, I learnt what it was to be despised without even batting an eyelid. When I rang the bell at the Polaks’, I caused considerable fear. The uncle, aunt and sister were still well; they were hiding in the cellar; yet, no-one seems to have come into the house. I could not stay long. I was not to see my sister for two years! When I arrived back in the apartment in the afternoon, it became clear to me that, for the second time, I had been lucky. Whilst I was away, the ‘black’ police were there. The apartment was locked. This did not disturb me and did not present any obstacle, but the annoying thing was that only the furniture remained…., everything else had been stolen. .., even my baggage with the good suit had disappeared. Fortunately, I found another bundle with clothes not as good. I changed into civilian clothing and packed boots and jodhpurs. I kept the hat with the fold-down brim with me. As there were always Wehrmacht at police patrols around the central station, which was something less to be feared at smaller stations, I took the train from Muiderpoort station to Utrecht. It was a rather strange thought to travel on a train once more after such a long time. You could tell a good Dutch person from a Dutch Nazi Party Member from a distance. The good ones looked tired and depressed, whereas the coldness and unease of the Nazi Party Members, turning into a despised and at the same time feared person…, this you could read from their eyes! I studied the faces of the ‘silent’ uniformed Nazis very closely at the time. They had something rigid about their eyes, as though they feared something, which they did not want to admit. From this trip into an unknown adventure, I took to imitating these people when they asked for my ID card, or whenever I had anything to do with them, whereas I presented myself in a more relaxed manner to the decent Dutch person. I said to myself that no-one would doubt that I was anything other than those I tried to impersonate, if I could manage a rigid facial expression. At the time, my attitude became artificial, which I began by imitating a certain facial expression and later completely developed, whereby I could look a member of the Gestapo in the face without twitching; but rather cheekily. I also said to myself that I could be like Jan Overbeek; if I wanted it strongly enough. If it ever got difficult for me over the next few years, then the conviction would never leave me, that I was that which I imitated. I simply learnt to think my personality away, as soon as I was with people. This daring had nothing to do with my non-Jewish appearance - this at least I convinced myself of- an ID Card in which I had confidence, in particular, a stance, which could be expressed through the eyes. “What do you want?” “Do you know who I am?” - They had saved me as well as quite a few coincidences and some luck. I shared the same fear of any Nazi Party man; the difference being that I only feared him; he had a certain fear of the entire Dutch population. I soon realised that the average Nazi would only instil fear when you lowered your eyes from him or looked at him aggressively. I had something else in common with the Nazis, who helped him or look at him aggressively. I had something else in common with the Nazis which helped me to behave in a cold-blooded manner…, hatred! I hated him with such might and passion, that I felt at my most secure within society within the company of true Nazis. Jew Haters and blood thirsty enemies of the Bolsheviks. Thus, it was only fear and hatred (this hatred against every Nazi I perhaps brought with me from my childhood, which persecuted Jewish children like us -only with other signs) kept me alive. Later, the fear became a fear for my life; the hatred turned into self-hatred, but this has nothing more to do with this account. The name of the Farmer in Jutphaas escapes me. He was not a bad sort, only terribly greedy. Unfortunately, he was disappointed by my arrival, as he asked an experienced hand, who could milk and do all connected with hay; and now the Labour Exchange sent him somebody, who had no idea of these things. Long working hours, poor food and crazy thoughts, which swirled around my head, had the effect of making me permanently tired. I would have liked to have slept 24 hours a day. The feeling of tiredness, of never having slept enough which for everyone became ever worse in Germany, during the innumerous air raids, perhaps also contributed to the fact that I could do many things automatically without fear, as though in a dream. The Farmer, of course, did not know that I was a Jew. I waited until it became clear which church he belonged to. When I knew he was a Catholic, much of this not being apparent at first, I presented myself as a Calvinist. This saved me from having to pray with him every morning. It seemed to please him greatly when I put my hands together and silently murmured a prayer…, I mostly chose the Schechijanah. Nevertheless, we never really got along. I dosed whilst standing and did not understand how to milk the cows. The time, however, passed very slowly. I told the man that I was actually a Fruit Farmer and understood all about apples, pears and other fruits. I knew a little of this from my time in Gouda. Two weeks later, something happened, which, today, seems anecdotal to me. I was mowing the grass with Theo, one of the hands who was a real Farmboy and a really nice bloke. It was about 10 o’clock in the morning when we saw a motorcycle and sidecar drive into the courtyard. By the high caps worn, it was possible to recognise, at a distance, that they were Dutch Military Police, who were infamous at the time as Trackers of Jewish and non-Jewish people in hiding. The police did not remain long in the courtyard before driving over to us in the pasture. The men checked our documents thoroughly. It was the first test. My heart was beating in my throat! I lit a cigarette; the official turned the ID card on all sides. “You’re from Aalten?” “Yes!” Aalten lies by the Dutch border. “I could hear that immediately!”He gave me my card back; they both disappeared. I was not yet allowed to breathe a sigh of relief, as Theo was also not allowed to know anything about my identity. In response to these events, I said what any ordinary Dutchman would say…, “Pigs!” Theo then disappeared into a tirade of abuse. He then became more serious. “And you are aware” He said, as though he was disclosing a secret, “they’ve particularly got it in for the Jews, as if the poor Jews could do anything about being Jewish. The poor bastards!” “What can you do about it?” I asked in quite a resigned manner. “What can you do about it?” Theo became quite angry. “I would not just allow myself to be sent away!” “Me neither! If I were a Jew, I would just simply take off the star of David patch and get false Dutch ID papers, if possible and then go somewhere to a Farmer, where no-one knows me…, What do you think?” “I’d do exactly the same, I think!” This conversation has remained almost verbatim in my mind. It became clear to me in mid-August that I could not get on with the Farmer. Ever more often he became sharp with me and I found it dangerous and useless to contradict him. I had to find myself another job. On top of this was the house next door.., a small printer’s shop; the meeting place of the Friends of the Dutch National Socialist Party connected with the owner. But what should I do? One day, I travelled to Amsterdam after making a snap decision and left most of my luggage at the luggage office at the railway station in Utrecht. I was looking for Gideon Drach, who was of the opinion that it would take a week or longer until he found something suitable. At the time, it wasn’t that easy. In the meantime, I lodged with an acquaintance of Cilly; a Christian lady, two unmarried teachers who were called Aunt Miss and Aunt Cock by the children. Apart from Cilly and her sister, a few of the other siblings of the numerous children of the Laub family lived in the apartment. By virtue of his spectacles, Leo Laub was called ‘Trotzky’ and had been with me in Gouda. He was a brother of these four Laub’s. In spite of his Jewish appearance, he casually went for a stroll in Amsterdam; he couldn’t take it for long in one area. He was seized; we’ve heard nothing from him since. Here, at Tintorettostraat 24, I remained for 3 weeks. The others being protected were only there temporarily, until the two good aunts, who had already helped many Jewish children, found a hiding place. One after the other left…., Cilly too! I remained alone in the apartment for a week. I was regularly able to listen to English radio; every word was like balsam. The slightest news of the collapse of the German front in the East was like a greeting from a fairy tale-like free world. Nevertheless, the end of the war was not in sight. From Tintorettostraat, I was sent to Jan Kuperus, a Garden Designer in Zeist, a small town by Utrecht. Kuperus, a strictly religious Protestant, who played in a harmony of church songs and psalms every Sunday, became the epitome of the Dutch spirit of resistance…., resolute, wise, pious, true to the Queen, a friend to the Jews and with unbending hatred of the Nazis. He was around 50 years old, married, and had two children. He owned a large space with greenhouses, flowers and vegetables. On the other side of the road, in the former rectory, was the High Command of the Luftwaffe in Holland. For various reasons, Kuperus had reason to go in and out of the building, as he had taken over the work of a Flower Gardener and dealt with the Germans. I often went there with him. We would thoroughly reconnoitre the camouflage put up by the Germans; for the first time I saw an artificial forest and a building, which was apparently only scenery. Of all the German soldiers, those in the Luftwaffe seemed the most human to me, which was contributed to by the colour of their uniform. I often entered into conversation with one of the guards; he was on older good-humoured idiot from Vienna, who was more interested in beer and food than politics. He considered it de rigeur that we chatted about Holland and that he could send home real coffee and butter. He even argued that “If the Dutch were on our side, things would be different! But, as they are our enemies.., and that we first of all had to fight them, it is how it is! They wouldn’t have fared much better with us! War is war! It wasn’t any different either in the First World War!” He had only profanities for the Germans. A young subordinate man worked in the garden at the Kuperus household, who seemed to me to be an intellectual. He spoke with an accent and maintained that he was Belgian. To me, his accent appeared Yiddish! In reality, the man was from Poland and was called Fuchs. I met him again after the war in Amsterdam. Today, he is the Director of the ‘Rosenthaliana’ the Jewish collection at the library of the University of Amsterdam. Furthermore, I recollect seeing a large, handsome young man, who looked exactly like Fuchs and not like a Gardener. He was an officer in the Dutch Navy and went into hiding to avoid being a prisoner of war. How long he succeeded in this, I do not know! In September, I resettled into a room with a poorish family made up of a divorced woman of around 50 years and her children, a daughter of 22 and a boy of 16 years. I continued to work at Kuperus’ using a bicycle with wooden wheels to get there. I got to know one of the friends of my host’s daughter. His name was Charles Smid and was a Shipper on the Rhine on leave. In those times, major raids started; it was not only hidden Jews who were searched for, but also Dutchmen between 18 and 35 years old, who had not voluntarily registered themselves for labour duty in Germany. According to my papers, I was admittedly 17, but a mistaken arrest could have had serious consequences, as upon closer inspection, or through any other circumstances, my true origin could have been discovered. Should a Dutchman be caught, then he would be sent to a forced labour camp in Germany; whilst for Jews, there was only Mauthausen, Dachau, Buchenwald, Auschwitz etc. I spoke with Charles, he told me of the journey by boat along the Rhine and I asked him all sorts of things to the smallest detail. He worked on a German boat which travelled between Germany, Holland and Belgium, ferrying iron and coal. I wanted to know how it worked on such a ship; about life, the wages etc. “Why did you choose to travel along the Rhine by boat in the end?” “Why not! I always wanted to see something of the world” “Can you come right away? We always need people! Have you a passport?” Naturally, I didn’t have a passport. I, therefore, spoke to Kuperus, who was the only one who knew I was a Jew apart from his wife and the two Teachers in Amsterdam. He said “I’ll get you one!” Two days later, I had a Dutch passport, prepared by the Zeist parish. In the meantime, Charles had already travelled away, but he had left his address behind for me………, ‘The Matthias Stinne 72’, an 1100 tonner just above Schiedrecht, lying on the southbank of the Rhine. I bought myself a ship’s hat, a rollneck jumper and a Sailor’s bag. Moreover, I owned two suits, shirts, warm underwear, the jodhpurs with the boots and was, otherwise, very well equipped. I lugged the boots around with me on the off-chance of selling them. Half bald-headed with the seaman’s hat and the sack, I left Zeist one morning to find a ship, lying outside of Schiedrecht on the Rhine. During the summer, I had already got used to being like Jan Overbeek. Were I ever to be stopped at railway stations or on the streets, so I would produce my ID card with the most natural of hand movements. For the Gestapo or the ‘blacks’ who looked at me, I only had my stare left.., which said: “What do you want you louse?” It was not playing with fire; I believe it was the opposite of that. I learnt to employ my stare in all its variations; from indifferently calm or mocking, even to the expression of secret connivance and looked at those, who seemed dangerous to me, so unashamedly, that they often lowered their eyes. Civilian or military patrols I would stare at as if they were uselessly wasting their timee He , slightly mockingly, impatiently or with the value of understanding, that duty is duty. The fear of the Nazis was a different fear; the fear of having to bear a lonely fate. I presented myself as a foreigner to the Germans; to Dutch Farmers or Shippers I would say I was a farmhand, which was what my Dutch ID card said. To students from Germany, France or Holland, I did the same. I found it most difficult with inmates of concentration camps, who often went to Germany on the ships, in order to unload or with clearance work after bombings in the cities or in building bunkers. I often spoke to them, threatened by the SS and had to be regarded as a foreigner from a foreign world. The look of these pitiful figures, who fell upon my cigarette butts (I threw them away after only being slightly smoked!), who tore pieces of bread from my hands; these people, whose eyes screamed lament and hunger, are unforgettable to me. Since I had escaped through the skylight on the 20th June and had distanced myself from the fate of my fellow Jews, I was an outcast, a rogue.., “someone who had saved their life, but nothing else!” Late in the evening, I arrived in Schiedrecht. It was wet, cold and dark and I had to find a ship, which was somewhere in the upper reaches of the small town, moored on the other bank. I went to the river and saw the red and green lights of the boats. It was too late to go down there, so I found somewhere to sleep in a coffee house and waited for the coming day. It was early when I got to the boat; bow facing upstream; its destination being Gent. The German Sailor took me on. When we got to the border I was not allowed entry after a tense wait. In a small Guard’s house on the canal, I not only had my passport checked, but also my Dutch ID card, which was checked with the help of a book. I waited twenty minutes in mad tension. Then I was called by a German with an uncanny facial expression. Outside, the boat passed through the lock. Now, I thought…, the game’s up! Where was my Rhine Sailor stamp? I hadn’t heard anything about that. It was my first trip. I wanted to get away from home. What had I been doing in Zeist? “Many of my friends have gone off to Germany. I’d heard that there is a lot of work in Germany…., that the earnings are better there!” “Wonderful! But without a Rhine Sailor stamp we cannot let you cross the border” I asked him where I could go and get one. I was told, in my district, upon which I spoke to the ship’s captain that I would see him again in four days in Gent. The Germans said “If you do come back, then just come to us. There are good transport connections to Gent from the town” There was nothing left for me but to travel back to Zeist. Kuperus was astonished to see me. The case was tricky. The Rhine Sailor’s stamp was issued by the provincial commissary of the Reich and now, during the war, functions of this office were carried out by Seyss-Inquart. It was impossible to go to his offices with a forged Dutch ID card. For two days, I was questioned by those in the underground. It was an individual case. What else was there to do? They simply decided to make the stamp in three languages, amongst which was the official stamp of the city of Zeist and the signature of the Secretary of the Municipality, who was a member of the resistance. Thus, in my forged passport was a forged stamp, which wasn’t a stamp at all. I was afraid of travelling back with this improvisation; yet I thought that if I hadn’t fallen into the net after a thorough 20 minute check, I could calmly rest assured. Thinking “this is what I was given at the Mayor’s office.., nothing can change that!” In the hope of seeing the same officials again, I travelled back as quickly as possible. Of course, they were not both there, but one of them was. I explained that I had got the stamp. “You’ve certainly acquired the stamp at this bureaucracy, as it goes with such offices!” The Germans ‘swallowed’ the story. Nevertheless, the officials told me that they could not let me through, as their office was just a transitional point for the occupation of the boats; no-one else was allowed to pass through. This prospect made me very nervous of being so strictly checked by another Border Guard. I had all my things on the boat; I was expected there; couldn’t really turn back and did not trust any other border post. I asked if he could make an exception just this once. The man, who knew me from last time, would have done it, but he was not alone and the other one insisted on speaking to a superior. He made a phone call. After an hour of waiting impatiently, the Lieutenant came. Now, the questioning resumed. He questioned me thoroughly. “OK!” Then on this exception only, I’m letting you through! But you must not cause difficulty in future…, understood?” Now, the other two became friendly again and I then walked along the canal to Belgium.., thinking of getting out of their sight as quickly as I could. In Belgium, at least in the cities, through which I had made my way to Gent, it appeared to me that the people here were doing better than the Dutch. The stores were relatively full; the prices were admittedly high, but almost all of the products available on the market were two or three times the price. Belgium was under military occupation, consisting of older soldiers; the SS and suchlike were almost non-existent. It was in this way that the country appeared rather peaceful. I arrived in Osthafen late in the afternoon and found my boat. They had not yet begun to unload. We carried chiselled stones meant for the construction of the Atlantic Wall, and loaded coal, which went to the Ruhr. There was loading or unloading to be done; there was always lots of work to be done on the boat. There was constantly something to repair; wires to connect, painting, tarring or washing. The ship’s Captain belonged to a bad sort of German. It could not be determined whether he was the usual sort of Nazi. Nonetheless, he hated foreigners. The crew were never German, but either Dutch, Belgian or French. Charles was allowed to do all kinds of things, because he had the most experience on water; he had already been a professional Shipper before the war. Marcel, with the growing bald head, who had already run away from Germany twice and had been ‘caught’ twice, sang almost the whole day and laughed in the Shippers’ faces with the most innocent facial expression, who called him a fool and a stupid crewmate behind his back. I, who’d never in his life battened any hatches, carried pails of water or tarred ships walls, was considered by the Shipper so unskilled, that he could find no words to describe me. Sometimes, he would say aloud what he was thinking. “And you’re supposed to work with such blokes! Too stupid to die!” He also poured scorn on Charles, who, at every opportunity, was drunk to the rafters and plagued with sexual diseases. He proudly told me that he had had gonorrhoea thirty times in the last seven years. The Shipper had an upright, podgy blonde as a wife, who did not speak a word to us, nor replied to our greetings. You could see by her face what she thought of us! “Foreign rabble!” Our later experiences taught us that the Germans considered foreigners and even we ‘Germanics’ as inferior and not worthy of trust. The Germans I talk of here and who I got to know during my time on the Stinne were simple and the simplest of people; small business folk, Shippers, Farmers, Hosts, Employees, Soldiers, Guards, Workers etc. They hated foreigners, not only when ordered to do so; their town, cities and workplaces were overcrowded with foreigners, who they in part feared, in part ‘envied’, because they had not joined the Wehrmacht…, the German Army. The attitude was that they were doing far too well. They did not want anything to do with the misery, persecution, experiences of the German occupation, forced transport and hunger. The more the German population became subject to air-raids, the more indifferent and unconcerned they considered the fate of the ‘foreigners’. In the civilian life of Germany, there was no hunger, no deportations, or ‘special measures’, as in the ‘occupied zones’. My report talks only of terror, meanness and pettiness, as well as mistrust, which the simple German displayed to his non-German ‘Germanic’ brother. Quite apart from the racist fantasies of Hitler etc, even the German non-Nazi exhibited a hostile, indifferent attitude towards foreigners. Before we left Gent, we hoarded around 5kg of tobacco. When I say ‘we’, it only means that I was a co-conspirator. Charles and Marcel bought the tobacco in Gent and hid the packets under the coal. For smuggling of this kind you would be given around 5 years in prison. I learnt a new lesson…., join in! Whatever my comrades were up to on board the ship, I would not be left out of it. This would have made my part untenable. I often enough became an object of suspicion, when I wrote in my diary every evening and every page was dedicated to ‘my dearest’……., I never added Cilly’s name. At the end of the war I had hundreds of pages of this diary. I remember a visit to the harbour café in Gent ‘Het Konijn’, which belonged to two fat blonde sisters. Charles and Marcel were well known there. We arrived there late, when it was almost empty. Only about six to eight people were still there…, Shipper’s with their girlfriends. One of the girls urged Marcel to sing something. I can see the scene before me as though it was yesterday; how he climbed onto a chair, his bald head shining in the light of some of the lamps on the back wall of the café and sang his version of ‘j’attendrai’. It was a huge success and all three of us got free beer. Later, we went down into the cellar (a café in Belgium or Holland was like a pub in England). The sisters there had a real storage space of rationed food, ham, butter, chocolate and tobacco as though they had supplies for half of Gent. Prices were high. Charles got his tobacco there. My money just sufficed to buy two packets of shag. The following day, we travelled up the Albert Canal to Sasvan in Gent. I was, more or less, used to the fear I felt at the border check. I was used to the fear. I was, of course, Dutch and they could not bar me entry into ‘my own’ country. What I feared considerably more were the customs officers, who came aboard the boats at the border crossing. We had already passed the border when a River Police motorboat came alongside. Due to the heavy traffic on the canal, the border was not often properly policed and the River Police often followed-up. Of course, I knew nothing of this at the time. I probably heard a motorboat moor up, but thought, however, it was a supply boat, as they travelled to and from, moored-up and sold their cargoes. It terrified me even more as a Border Policeman suddenly came down the stairs holding my passport in his hands. It was usual on board a ship to store your passport or shipper’s card with the Captain. The Policeman asked…, “Are you Overbeek?” “Yes!” “Have you any other identification?” I gave him my Dutch ID card, which he casually looked at. “Have you got a letter from your Labour Exchange, stating that you have been allocated to shipping?” I thought nothing of this ‘triviality’ and answered “No! I know nothing of this!” “You should have a letter from your labour exchange!” “Indeed!” “When will you get this sorted out?” “As soon as possible!” “Have you any dependents?” “A Grandfather” “Parents?” “Passed away!” “Oh…, and how is it that you speak such good German?” “Austrian!” “And the other half?” “Dutch!” He looked at me rather distrustfully. “Well…., get that sorted out!” “Of course!” “Heil Hitler!” “Goodbye!” I listened to how he went to the bow to the Shipper, presumably to take my passport back. I only breathed a sigh of relief after he had cast off the motor boat and travelled back to Belgium. I had a new concern…., I considered the long and short of it and decided, however, to remain on the boat. I trusted myself on the trip to Holland, which stretched along both banks of the Rhine, grey and without comfort. A simple nuisance…., I thought! I hoped to get to Germany as soon as possible, where I would be among thousands of other foreign workers and would be able to obtain my Economic Activity Card, as well as no longer being exposed to harassment from the police and border security. I assumed, quite correctly, that the Shipper had complained about my lack of skill as a Sailor. I intended to transfer to another boat immediately upon my arrival in Duisburg. It took practically a week before we moored on the lower reaches of the Lobith, late in the evening, where the border crossing was. The following morning, when we passed the border, everything went smoothly. It was the 1st of November 1943, a cold, grey rainy day. It was possible to see the silhouettes of peaceful villages and immediately afterwards a red reflection and smoke from huge factories, hidden behind a misty veil. Almost everything, which later happened to me in Germany, was decided for me in this first picture; the peaceful and equally dead quietude of the villages; the industriousness of the factories, the cold, the uncanniness, the grim dogged depression and the heavy leaden veil over the country. Germany seemed like a nightmare to me; an unpleasant, cold, repellent world. My documents were a cause of concern to me…., and I felt myself on borrowed time. In Holland, you were fair game; in Germany, where all the workers were drawn from every country, there was no need to fear anything other than the bombs. I felt safest in the lion’s den. The worker on the ship had the advantage for me of being relatively isolated. This was to be appreciated, as there were no end of informers in the foreign labour camps…, in particular, amongst the Dutch and Belgians, where care was particularly necessary. You could get yourself really comfortable in the hammock in your corner of the boat. There was always coal, so it was always warm and as we often moored in villages, it was possible to buy potatoes from farmers or exchange them for coal or even bacon – 20 Reichsmarks per kilo – was available. We received supplemented payments for heavy labour and, thus, had practically double the rations, in addition, the distribution for the same for the Shipper’s were, basically, higher than with other professions. The work was, admittedly, hard but bearable…., we could, of course, ‘only’ do the work normally required of us on a boat and with its loading. Admittedly, we were disparaged and abused by the German Shippers’, but they needed us…., they were reliant upon us. All in all, I was still ashamed of myself, when I thought of my people, who were dragged into concentration camps and were, there, tormented by the SS. I also, however, felt ashamed due to the foreign forced labourers, who, whilst leading a hard life within the camp, were harassed with hard labour, hunger and sickness. Of course, there were also bombs and low-level air raids, where the ships were always threatened, in particular. The ships, themselves, like the factories, docks and cargo points were always ablaze as sites important to the war effort. Just as safe as you felt in some respects; rather better nourished and clothed than others, you were, in others, in a more unpleasant position…, being exposed to a sudden hail of bombs from the sky. The danger was particularly large in docks such as Duisburg, Mannheim, Leverkusen, Mainz or Frankfurt, as there were scarcely any high bunkers close to the docks. You were surrounded by water, and at the sound of a full-scale alarm, had to balance across boards and ladders to get to land. It was a threat, when you were moored at a quay, which you were not familiar with and sought cover under a crane; it was no less precarious in the sluices, popular targets for attack. Moreover, there were the low-level air-raids from Spitfires, which dived unexpectedly out of the clouds riddling the bridges of the boats with their machine guns. I was witness to countless such attacks. It was an uncanny feeling that you could not creep along the ground, being surrounded by a huge current. I couldn’t even swim! From November 1943, I travelled in the course of time, on four different boats between Duisburg and Mannheim along the Rhine; upon smallish boats up the river Neckar and Main, or on the Herne canal and other shipping channels. I was second mate and only worked myself in slowly, always employed in navigation. Involuntarily, I was steered virtually into a wall and was investigated for sabotage…, the matter, however, turned out alright. The Shippers were German and my comrades were mostly Dutch. We had, as previously mentioned our Shipper’s ration cards with supplements; we shopped for ourselves and cooked for ourselves. The crew consisted of Shippers, who mostly took their wives with them, as well as two or at most three Sailors. Amongst ourselves, mostly also with the Shippers, however, we spoke Dutch. Whenever my knowledge of German caused question, so I would say that my mother came from Austria to Holland along with many other refugees; had remained there and married my father. My wages as Second Mate were 200 Reichsmarks; later increased by 40 Reichsmarks. We were entitled to one free day per week. Sometimes, I had to dispense with it, but was recompensed with a replacement or an increased rate. The working hours were practically unlimited, yet night work was particularly well rewarded. In this way it was that we travelled in our boats, towed by a tugboat. The crew of the steam tugboats had nothing to do with the individual boats. Each boat had its own independent shipper. I carried an Economic Activity Card as ID, which sufficed at all checks; the Dutch ID card remained in my baggage, whilst the passport was with the Shipper. The journey from Duisburg to Mannheim lasted ten days. Whenever we were free, we mostly went into the cities; went to the cinema, sat in the café etc. In doing this, you would always meet Germans or foreigners, almost always ordinary people and it also came to pass, that I always met the same people. The conversations concerned everyday issues, food, personal fate, occasionally also political issues, whereupon I naturally held back. I was also suspicious of the Dutch and Belgians on account of spies. If I knew the character of those with whom I spoke…, I could also talk more freely. Amongst this, there were also advertisements with application forms for the SS or NSKK. These pamphlets promised many advantages emphasising the Germanic society and sought to attract candidates through high wages and other perks. You hardly heard of anyone being enticed into registering as a result. Even allied letter drops came into our possession. We read them and passed them on mainly to non-Germans. Sometimes, there was contact with members of the SS, commonly Croats, Slavs and Ukrainians, who spoke very bad German; and concentration camp inmates, Jews, as well as non-Jews; mostly men, but also women, as well as Russian and Polish ‘Workers from the East’. The SS accompanied the prisoners as their guards. I do not know which original camps they belonged to. Their work consisted of either clearing up after the raids, or in urgent cargo work, whilst loading was otherwise the work of the ‘Workers from the East’ or Russian prisoners of war. The Russian prisoners of war in the green uniforms were used in the operation of smoke machines and flak at sluices. Squads from concentration camps could consist of 10-200 people, were constantly dressed in ‘zebras’ and had a prisoners patch in all colours, whose meaning was once explained to me by a member of the SS. Abuse at work was avoided, but the physical conditions of these people was pitiful. The German civilians avoided the prisoners, who, generally, as it was widely publicised, were considered criminals. I spoke ever more often with the prisoners, on a furtive basis. If this was noticed by an SS guard, he would send me away. Yet, it was more often possible to pass these people bread and cigarettes, which they asked for. Unfortunately, this was a drop in the ocean, as you could only share out your own rations, and then only to those standing next to you, which was viewed upon enviously by the others. In April 1944, I met a group of 200 Hungarian Jewish women in Essen, who came on board the boat in the icy cold in only thin scraps of clothing, so the rest of them, who were engaged in the loading of coal, could shovel together the rest, which could not be picked up by the crane. I talked with two girls, who told me in German where they came from. The ‘Workers from the East’ wore civilian clothing with a patch on the front and back sewn on saying ‘East’ and were a very close-knit group. They were supervised by their own Foremen or even Soldiers. I once saw the burial of the victims of a raid in an Eastern Workers’ Labour Camp, at which 350 people had been killed. The Russian prisoners of war were guarded by the military. The Russians begged for bread and cigarettes or tried to exchange goods. As a result of my constant travelling, I was, even if not an eye witness, so well informed about so many things that happened in Germany. I could also see that the ‘total war’ in all its inhumanity and grotesqueness, gave the Germans inner stability. In May 1944, I met a Jewish man of about 23 years of age on the street for the first time in Germany, in the Osthaven quarter of Frankfurt, with a Star of David patch. I stopped him….., and it went without saying that he was afraid…, but I reassured him that this was not necessary, as I was a Dutch foreign worker. I asked him how many Jews there still were in Frankfurt. He said, a few hundred, who were cramped together in two houses and had to live off small Jewish rations. They were not allowed to seek shelter in the Air Raid Shelters during air raids. I once visited a bed and breakfast at a quay in Mainz, whose room occupancy seemed strange to me. The landlord told me that the building had previously been a synagogue. I did not notice anything upon entering, otherwise, I would, naturally, not have gone in. Within the building, I noticed a podium in the middle of a hall, which also served as a dancefloor. It was the Almemor. Upon leaving the bed and breakfast, I could recognise the original purpose of the building from its architecture. We were entitled to 8 days leave each year. The time of year allowed us 12 days free, as our boat froze in Eberbach on the Neckar. I spent this time with a Russian civilian labourer. It was about May 1944, when I got into an argument with a Shipper, a man of 75 years of age, who had been required to return to work as a result of the war and who considered nothing right. He really swore at me, during which he really let loose about the Dutch in particular. Upon which I told him to shut his mouth and that he was, himself, a filthy German pig. He threatened to call the police and even allowed them to come aboard. There were two River Police. I got a real scolding and was told that things would be really bad for me if they were ever to hear about me again. We travelled back to Duisburg, where I tried to get transferred to another boat, but it was, at the time, not possible. On the next trip, we travelled to Műnster. Shortly before we reached it, I got into an argument with the Shipper once more. Without being serious in his threat, he once again brought the River Police aboard, who immediately took me with them and transported me to a barracks nearby, where a detective in civilian clothing was in charge. He immediately interrogated me, without really knowing what it was all about. I had to stand to attention; he fumbled with a revolver a said “You Dutch must learn to keep your mouths shut here! You lost the war and your Queen has also left you! You should be happy we’re still treating you properly!” I explained “I don’t put up with everything from my Shipper! I came to Germany voluntarily to work and assist the German war economy!” This made quite an impression. The man yelled again, but this time not so seriously. Before he finally let me go, he threatened me. “If we get you again, then you’ll see what’s happening to the Jews in the concentration camps.” I was given my passport back and went back to the boat. When the Shipper saw me, he was very disappointed, as he had hoped to be rid of me once and for all. During a later trip, which went to Kiel, I got into a brawl with the Shipper, where I struck him in the teeth and he set upon me with a cosh, which I took away from him and broke. I gained some prestige with the Dutch Sailors, who knew each other, as we often met on the trips, as they all hated this Shipper. In Kiel, I ran into the Stinnes-depot and, this time, was in luck, as I was immediately transferred to another boat. Admittedly, even the Shipper was glad to be free of me. Whenever we docked in Bremerhaven, Hamburg, Kiel or Lűbeck, we met up with Swedish Sailors, who sold cigarettes from America. The Swedes had money in abundance and mostly behaved very coolly towards the foreigners. They gave them nothing for free, at most newspapers, which I read eagerly and learnt a little Swedish, as well as informed myself about the situation in the world. In the Sea Ports, there were brothels in the barracks run by the German Navy, which could be visited by the ship’s Captain and his hands. The barracks for Germans and those for foreigners were separate and signposted accordingly. You did not need a medical examination upon visiting. Inside, there was a reception, which was furnished with tables and benches, an Old Madam who came from France, just like the girls running around in their underwear. The ‘Madam’ had to be paid around 4 Reichsmarks, as well as buying a girl a beer or other drink (the Shippers had a one litre ration of Brandy per month and after major raids were given replacement supplies). You had to pay 40 Reichsmarks to the girl herself and you had to go into a room furnished like a hotel bedroom and stay for five minutes. All the girls had their regular lovers, usually crew members of German ships. On one occasion, I spoke to a Swede, asking him if it was possible to hide on his ship and escape. He fobbed me off by saying “Oh, the war won’t last long. You’ll get in no danger because of it!” Neutral ships were constantly searched by the Gestapo. Even though I never felt threatened, I always entertained ideas of fleeing. Just as I never appeared conspicuous to the Germans, this was also so with the Dutch, except for an incident in Heilbronn, when a Dutch sailor said to his mates in my presence “Jan .., he could be a Jew!” Whereupon I grabbed him by the collar and said “You’ll not say such a thing! I’ve got nothing against the Jews, but to be insulted as a Jew, I won’t put up with either!” He asserted that he did not mean anything by it and, with that, the matter was settled. We mostly bore coal and iron, but other boats carried food and other freight. Much of what happened during my time on a boat escapes me; other things I still see clearly before me. Amongst these, are the evenings in ‘The Anchor’, a Shippers tavern in Duisburg. ‘Mummy’ the Landlady, was an elderly woman of about 60, who spent her evenings amongst the Shippers. She did not have a husband; he’d run away from her years ago. Her son had gone to the Eastern Front and was killed there in 1942. “Mummy’ was everywhere, in the Tavern, when something happened. Now and again, she took someone back to her room. She did not do this ‘professionally’, but only not to be alone. Then there was Inge, the 20 year old friend of ‘Mummy’ with a child by a soldier. She was in the work detail and left her child with her mother, when she worked in the tavern during the evening. Inge was one of the countless German girls, who as a result of the war, were completely neglected. In ‘Mummy’s’ company there was a certain Heinrich, perhaps 50 years old, who had been discharged from military service for some such reason. He looked rather ill, hung around in bars and lived off of small trades; but was also a foreman in a larger tablemaker’s. Heaven only knows, why I remember the names and faces of these three people. Germany was full of people of this ilk. Wider society had the constant concern of how to somehow keep themselves full on the meagre rations, of how to keep their possessions safe during the nightly air-raids, as well as how to obediently follow the hundreds or so of regulations. If, on occasion, you mentioned that the Germans’ could have spared themselves this suffering, the usual answer was “War is war! What can you do?” This war is war response; perhaps best describes the mood of the Germans during the last two years of the war. Stupidly, you repeated the words off the cuff of Goebbels, who held the Bolshevists, Americans and Jews responsible for Germany’s difficult time. On the occasion that someone expressed criticism, which could happen now and again, so they just moaned, if a foreigner stopped nearby. Otherwise the pithy words “Such people as us have no say! It’s best to keep your mouth shut and do your work!” were heard. The wider society in Germany, which I dealt with, differed from others in the same circumstance, which I knew from Rotterdam, Gent or Amsterdam, admittedly, in only one important point. Germans were thoroughly harder, more brutal and seemed to view the war as an unavoidable evil. That the SS criminals could be recruited out of such a mob enlightened me no end. I would like to say, what I could often remark, that the SS man or committed Nazi, who held a political stance, differed from the usual German patriot. It seemed to me, as though that which had crystallised in the Nazi which was considered as orderly, decent and correct. This impression, which has remained unaltered from my stay in Germany, emphasises that which I perceived in wider society. The concept and hatred towards foreigners was a typical characteristic of the average German, whilst, at least with the genuine Nazi, you understood that this characteristic was the basis of what formed his ‘world’ view. Of course, during this time, I met decent and nice Germans, who Hitler and his SS considered the scum of humanity. Yet these few exceptions only confirmed the rule. These people enjoyed no form or respect amongst their peers. They were considered as asocial elements, where nothing tallied. It always concerned people, who to me, apart from their theology, were personally unsympathetic. On the basis of my impressions, I dare to assert with certainty that the July Putsch in 1944 was absolutely unpopular; that it cost the lives of a few aristocrats, was not considered tragic by any German I met. On the 20th July, our boat lay opposite Leverkusen. The news of the failed assassination attempt upon Hitler and the subsequent arrests and shootings were commented upon by my Shipper in the following manner; “They’re getting their just desserts, that bunch of traitors! Now, as we find ourselves in the middle of a war its giving strength to the enemy!” Without knowing it, the man had said exactly what Goebbels had written in the papers. I also occasionally heard the Shipper say “The brothers in the Government are a pack of fools, which is the case with any Government!” I would like to report an earlier experience. It was on New Year’s Eve in 1943 in Eberbach. Within the largest hotel in the area, the name of which I’ve forgotten, there was a real party going on. Amongst the guests were sailors from the Germany Navy on leave, who dominated the great hall with their goings-on. They had drunk rather a lot. I recall a young, tall, blond sailor, who shouted with a drunken voice, “Down with the war! shit on the filthy war!” He grabbed me by the collar and wanted me to repeat these words with him. I was sober and would not let myself be dragged into it, the sailor was led out by his comrades and laid on the snow to sleep. Before he left the hall, he shouted once more “I shit on your Führer, Adolf Hitler!” As he was quite drunk, as were the majority of those present, the event passed without consequence. When I later went with my comrade Klass to the Neckar, we heard Ukrainian girls, who lived on the other side of the river, singing melancholic songs. In comparison to the Poles or Russians, the Ukrainians in Eberbach, as in other areas, had rather peaceful lives. They worked with farmers, in houses or factories and could, to a greater or lesser extent, move freely, Some lived in private houses; others in camps, where they had to be back by 10 o’clock in the evening. If I wanted to discuss politics with them, they always remained silent. They remained resigned in their outlook. Only from one of them, with whom I became friends, Nikolai Schilowski, I am aware, that he was a fervent communist. The greater part of his comrades were, if not anti-German, anti-communist or Ukrainian Nationalists. Nikolai possessed the necessary charm and reason, to be regarded as a natural leader by his country folk. He was popoular everywhere. He worked in a sawmill. During my stay in Eberbach we became good friends and saw each other for the last time in the summer of 1944. In Autumn the area with its large factories of the Brown Boverie Family was heavily bombed, where the Luftwaffe manufactured electrical equipment. What later happened to Nikolai is not know to me. In October 1944, the large bridge in Cologne was totally destroyed by an air-raid, whereupon boats up and down the Rhine were disturbed for weeks. We were, at that time, travelling, from Mannheim in Duisburg without cargo and were moored just by a little town near Koblenz. Three days in a row in the middle of the river we were exposed to low flying air-raids. The Americans stood at the ready at the River Eifel. In clear weather, you could hear the front approaching. The daily bombardments and shellings claimed numerous victims on the boats, and so it was that I decided to give up my life on the boats. I went to hospital in the city and had a stomach ulcer examined. Quite coincidently, I had a heavy cold with fever. They admitted me. I went into the hospital, with only part of my baggage and left a large suitcase and books on board the boat. In the town, whose name escape me, it was rather peaceful. My hospital bed, I shared with two old men, or whom one died in the night after my arrival. After a week, I was transferred for treatment by a specialist into a large hospital in Koblenz, because the cause of my illness could not be ascertained. The hospital in Koblenz was a huge building; a high bunker was only 20 paces away from it. This promised some security. Almost every night there were large-scale raids near to Koblenz, whilst the city itself was spared apart from a few smaller raids. On the 9th or 10th of November, however, a major raid began. During the warning siren I went into the bunker. As a result of this raid, almost all of Koblenz was entirely destroyed, even the hospital went up in flames. I had got used to going into the bunker or cellar without baggage, as it was only a hindrance when in haste and could not be stored in the bunker, so that it had to be constantly hauled around with you. During the fire, I tried to save my things. What I had in the night safe - diary, boots, some packages, tobacco and a bottle of brandy, I was still able to save .., yet my clothes, stored somewhere, burned. I looked for coupons for my lost clothing and also got them. I sold the book to an Italian; the brandy I exchanged for tobacco. I did not want to return to the boat at all. I succeeded in getting a transfer docket from the admissions department in Giessen. Koblenz burned for days on end. I slept for some nights in the bunker, in as much at it was possible to speak of sleep. I walked through the streets to view the damage. Although there was dead and devastation wherever you went, I felt a sincere sense of gloating. Work details of Prisoners were engaged in the clearing-up. The Germans walked between the ruins very depressed; you could occasionally notice, that this was the punishment for the crimes of the Germans. There is no doubt for me, that the bombardment of the civilian population is to be ascribed to the fact that when the Germans sensed that the defeat of their country was becoming ever clearer, then they turned against their own regime. As great as the destruction of the German cities was, in areas with high bunkers, the number of victims was proportionally small. It was the only way to show to the population that it served no purpose to try to impose a Pax Germanica upon the world. I believe that the doctrine put force is only to be met with force benefitted the Germans more than it harmed them. Only this terrifying demonstration, that sins had to be expiated that the Germans are totally, more anti-military in their attitude that the Russians, English, Americans or French. As a witness, I can confirm, that with the increase in air-raids the love of the idea to be lord and master of the rest of the world waned. In the middle of November, along with my transfer docket and the driving licence ID received, I made my way to Giessen, but travelled only to Limburg, as the train connections were atrocious. Here, I stayed at a hotel, my papers were good everywhere, and I remained two days. Before continuing my journey, I decided to return to my boat to collect my things. I assumed that as a result of the destruction of the bridge in Cologne, it would still be in the same place …., I wasn’t wrong! Were you to travel down the Rhine without Cargo, then two boats were always coupled together. Our boat had sustained a number of shots, whilst the boat next to us had sustained two or three dead as a result of low-level air raids, without the boat, itself, being seriously damaged as a result. The Shipper was not on board, and I collected my undamaged suitcase. I got to Giessen by train and hitched a ride, where I reported to the hospital, which was part of the University. The rooms were strewn with red crosses, which is why you could expect protection here. Various clinics served as military hospitals. Approximately a week after my arrival, Giessen was extensively destroyed by an air raid in the last days of November. Even the clinics went up in flames. This happened in the evening. Patients, who were not brought out of the higher storey’s in time during the warning siren, were killed. I remained in the garden of the clinic within a primitive bunker, only 20 meters away from the main building. They had built no safe concrete bunkers in Giessen as they felt too safe. Most people considered the buildings cellars as safer, which is why in my bunker only around 60 children, two Nuns and scarcely anyone else had gone there. I escaped with my life by a hair, as I stopped close to the exit of the bunker, which was generally regarded as very dangerous. This time, I was lucky, as the posts, which supported the entrance, held firm, whilst the ceiling of the room actually caved in. Afterwards, I walked around the city with the feeling of a reporter who was looking around to see what had happened. Again, I lost most of my things, but I still had a small suitcase with me with the most essential items. The following morning I had a transfer order drawn up for the closest hospital and it was in this way that I arrived in Marburg. Trains were not running, yet I took a coach allotted to Patients, which was so full that I could only travel on the roof. Even this was not permitted as I had helped the driver with the loading of luggage onto the roof. In terms of my health, I was almost as healthy as before. I lived in the hospital, where I was hardly ever treated. During the day, I stayed in the city. As I waited for my final examination in the waiting room, I started talking to a man in his forties. He asked me “What’s wrong with you?” “Nothing” “Why are you here then?” “I had something wrong with my stomach, but that is almost resolved” “Haven’t you yet been admitted?” “I’m too young!” “Why don’t you register voluntarily ?” “I don’t care for the soldier’s existence. I don’t like being a soldier!” “Are you German?” “No! I’m Dutch!” “How is it you speak such good German?” “My mother comes from Austria. We often spoke German at home!” “What have you done until now in terms of work?” I said that I was a sailor with Stinnes on a boat, but am now looking for other work. “Were you ever previously in Germany?” “No!” “How do you like it here ?” “Not too much! I’d rather be at home” “What do you think of the war?” “It looks hopeless to me” (I had pangs of conscience afterwards). “When your’re fit again .., come and see me!” “Where?” “I’ll write it down for you!” I told the man about my room in the hospital, where he appeared the following day and gave me his full address: Theador Hollnack, Baracke Mittelfeld, Dillenburg. At the same time, he gave me a copy of “Thus spoke Zarathustra!” Hollnack was initially very friendly to me, yet I had some concerns, because of my careless talk. A few days later, in the beginning of December, I was discharged. I purchased new clothes with coupons and travelled at random to Dillenburg for an adventure. Late in the evening, I arrived, the 20 kilometre trip had lasted many hours. I asked for the Mittelfeld Barracks at the railway station. I was shown such respect, information and told that the barracks lay halfway above the town on a mountain, where I prepared myself for a curious experience without fear. Initially I took a small room in the hotel ‘Zum Schwan’ The following morning at 10am, I wandered for 20 minutes from the mountain to the barracks. I went to Hollnack and was met by Fraulein Blom, his secretary. She had been expecting my arrival, and to my astonishment, was to give me an advance of 400 Reichsmarks for December. I decisively refused, I was very curious as I did not know at all what it was all about, what business it was and what was expected of me. After some pushing, I was really given all of my savings when put together to a small sum, to accept 100 Reichsmarks on the express condition that this would be considered as a form of loan, because I requested Fraulein Blom to wait a few days until Herr Hollnack, who had travelled to Berlin, returned. Fraulein Blom helped me find a room. I found out nothing more about the clandestine business than that it concerned a company working for the Air Ministry. I was asked to visit daily and I, thus, sat for many days in a room, where secretaries worked, while I read books. The whole matter became a bore to me, yet I awaited things to come with some tension. To my astonishment, nothing changed on Hollnack’s return. I was asked to appear every day at 9 o’clock in the morning and be at Hollnack’s disposal during office hours. He introduced me to his Personnel Manager, who requested I draw up a CV and made me aware of the fact that I would need approval from the Employment Exchange for my change in employment. Hollnack explained, however, that he would deal with this matter in writing via a request to the Employment Exchange and an understanding with the Stinnes Company. A monthly salary of 40 Reichsmarks was set aside for me. On my CV, I told the usual story and stated my father had been an Engineer at Philips in Eindhoven. The Personnel Manager was no longer interested in my records; yet it seemed advisable to me to make them disappear a few days later at an opportune moment. I carried them with me, should I need an excuse to make them reappear in case of need. I still did not know, what was being worked upon. My duties were, at first, very modest; I was sometimes sent into town on small errands by Hollnack, when no-one else had need of me. At Christmas, there was a celebration for all members of staff, just as there was on New Year’s Eve. In January, It was said that the office in Dillenburg (there were no other departments here) was supposed to be relocated to Berlin. About the middle of January I travelled to Berlin with Hollnack without anyone else, where we stayed in the ‘Friedrichsbahnhof’ boarding house. Hollnack took me with him to many events e.g. into the Air Ministry. As All of these matters betrayed no particular purpose and I was doing nothing, I thought that he only took me with him to allay any possible suspicion through my attendance as a result of various coincidences. I now knew, that Hollnack was a ‘Trustee’ of the Air Ministry for Nuclear Physics. The company existed nominally and was in reality a Government office. From the outside, it resembled a metallurgical concern and operated primarily in this field. Hollnack once showed me a photo asked: “Do you know what this is?” “No! No idea!” “It’s and X-ray of a steel mould” I did not take part in the discussions themselves, rather, I had to wait in the ante-room. I saw many people, mostly dressed in civilian clothes, presumably running errands here and there, yet I remember none of the names. Within the boarding house, resided high ranking Russian Officers of the Vlassov Army, Indians and even Foreign Diplomats, with whom I often dined with, but here too, I am unable to name any names. I felt like I was in a surreal world, but absolutely safe, as I was of course the well-dressed Private Secretary of a highly-placed person. Moreover, I had the feeling that most of the residents of the boarding house led the same foul existence as I did, as I at least could see nothing else than that as they walked aimlessly through the streets. Hollnack admittedly was not superfluous in his countenance, rather he was constantly exuberant. I knew that he came from and Officer’s family from Halle (a. S.) and had been a flying instructor with the Luftwaffe. He wasn’t, himself a physicist, but a man of high learning, who was not apparently a Ministry liaison to a group of Nuclear Physicists. Some of these learned men were often with him; I saw them and was treated as a young confidant of my boss. I remember specifically only a Norwegian Physicist, Dr Widerøe. On Saturday morning, we went into the Max Planck Institute, where Hollnack dropped off a document. To finish, we visited the empty laboratories and lecture halls. Hollnack was always dressed in civilian clothing and behaved mostly conservatively towards both high and low functionaries. He discussed many issues with me concerning life and culture. He also happily discussed philosophy with me; it was like a relationship between an elder, more experienced friend and a knowledge-hungry youngster. My language skills impressed him; I told him that I would like to study philosophy; I now led a dual double life. During the day, I was the loyal fiduciary of my superior; in the evening, I did not work and visited expensive taverns and hotels, went into the cinema and looked at the totally destroyed Berlin. There were constant raids, yet, initially, everything went really well. On the 3rd February 1945 at around 11 o’clock in the morning, I was just on my way from the boarding house back to Hollnack’s office in Friedrichstrasse, close to the Air Ministry when the heaviest daylight raid on Berlin began. When I wanted to leave the underground metro station on Friedrichstrasse, the air-raid warning commenced. I observed for a while, the fighter planes circling over the city. Quite a few passers’-by dived into houses or the metro station. I went down, although only personnel were permitted to do so and spent the time with some conductors. The raid lasted 45 minutes. I was not far from the blockade, where there was a direct hit. When the all-clear sounded, the burning city with its upturned trams and dead people and horses presented a horrifying sight. It took me a long while to get to the office in Friedrichstrasse, where I met Hollnack unscathed. He had spent the air raid in the safe bunker within the Air Ministry. Soon afterwards, we travelled in a wagon though Vialle, where we visited Hollnack’s relatives (the streets were crowded with refugees, prisoners etc), then on to Dreseden, Bautzen until we arrived in a remote goods-yard on the Silesian side of the Riesengebirge, mountain range. It concerned a discussion, however, I do not know anymore. The following day we travelled back to Berlin. Afterwards, we went back to Dillenburg, where preparations were being made to move the Mittelfeld barracks, including its stock, to Kellinghusen, 70 kilometres north of Hamburg. Hollnack had 60 large crates made there, which were filled with documents and were taken to Keillinghusen in two lorries. While some of the staff moved to Kellinghusen in the beginning of March, Hollnack remained with me in Hamburg, where we stayed in the hotel called “Zu den vier Jahreszeiten”. The elegant hotel was occupied by very rich people, yet the food was appalling. During an air-raid you would sit with women in Persian coats all wearing diamonds in the cellar. Most of the guests were German. One day, Hollnack assigned me the task to travel to Dillenburg to collect his Mother-in-law, who had been left behind. Hollanack’s wife had already resettled to Kellinghusen. A trip of this kind was in those days no easy matter. I received accompanying papers of all kinds from Hollnack, amongst which was identification with the letterhead of the Air Ministry of the Reich to the attention of various SS and Police Service Officers within the Reich and was Herr J G Overbeek on business trips on special assignment from the Air Ministry of the Reich and was to be of assistance in all matters. Equipped with enough finance, I travelled in the D-Zug first class. The journey was difficult I had to repeatedly alight from the train and walk for a few kilometres or see if other ways were possible to move forwards, before I could board a train once more. One had often to produce ID, if only because of the danger of parachutists. With my papers, I was splendidly equipped. In Dillenburg, I tried to get the elderly woman ready. When we were finally prepared, Hollnack appeared surprisingly in a car. I did not go with them; however, I was assigned the task to travel by rail back to Berlin, where I would meet Hollnack at a predetermined point. When I left Dillenburg, the front was already close to Wetzlar. The front was close, you could already hear canons, however, for a reason, which I myself cannot understand, I followed Hollnack’s instructions as thought I was his only form of security I needed several days to get to Berlin; Germany was already in a state of dissolution. People camped on the road; everywhere it was possible to see Wehrmacht patrols. I found Hollnack in Berlin, with whom I travelled for a few days to Kellinghusen, and where we accommodated in a prestigious landed property. Close by, a betatron was being built. Even when I really try today, I can barely remember anything of the last two months of the war, dates blur; the names have been forgotten. I only remember the 12th April well. On this day, I travelled with Hollnack via Lubeck to Berlin. During the journey, Hollnack made perhaps a telling statement about Roosvelt’s death, given his political stance, saying something like; “one of the greatest men of our time died today! It is a pity for him!” Due to these words, I invested more trust in Hollnack than hitherto. Beforehand, I did not speak directly with him about politics, but was justifiably tacit in my assumption that Hollnack like me, as a Dutchman, was totally against Nazism, which he could not approve, for which he certainly had understanding. However, I now dared to be a little clearer; “It is no wonder, that Germany is losing” I said “England, America and Russia are even stronger and Hitler’s madness in declaring war on the world has led to the destruction of German cities” Hollnack’s silence I took as approval. Again and again, I had the feeling that he was holding his tongue, because you “should not show your hand!” one never talked about the obvious! The purpose of our trip into the then besieged Berlin was curious. We collected revolvers. Each one of the twelve or thirteen people in Hollnack’s staff received a revolver. I was also given a Mauser pistol. Why that had to be remains a mystery to me. I helped Hollnack carry the pistols to a car, we had got from a munitions depot outside Berlin. There was already fighting in the outer districts of Berlin. It was possible to hear shooting from close by. I believe that we travelled back in the same night. The roads from Berlin to Hamburg were overcrowded with refugees, whilst we hardly saw any military personnel. Conversely, the route from Hamburg to Kellinghusen was almost totally quiet. We waited each day for the capitulation, yet in some shops you were still greeted with “Heil Hitler!” Virtually nothing in Kellinghusen had changed, conversely, the banners stating “Wir Kämpfen bis zum Sieg!” (We’ll fight on to victory!), which were painted on the walls by the Hitler Youth, awoke in me the impression that the front was not 100 kilometres away, but somewhere at the Polish border. I spent some few weeks on the second floor of a warehouse; the rest of the time in a landed property. Kellinghusen remained peaceful during this time. The many foreign labourers in the area met each evening in two large Inns within the town, where they were in the best of spirits. The time when they would soon return home was very close by. There were many Italians in uniform.., Badoglio Officers. I remember an Italian, whom I constantly met in the main street and we mutually assured each other of our joyous expectations at the soon-to-come capitulation. The Italians in Germany were just as badly treated as the Russians and Poles; they mostly went around in rags and looked more starved than most of the usual foreign labourers. Quite by the by, most foreign labourers led a reasonably good life, when they worked for example with a farmer or someone else in the private sector. Some went around quite well dressed; they had German girlfriends, there was no curfew. One could, in this way, spend the whole night in the streets and, as a foreigner, would not appear conspicuous by doing this. You only had to, when stopped, produce your ID card. Wehrmacht patrols appeared time and again; at railway stations and in restaurants, in order to apprehend deserters or soldiers, who had exceeded their leave. My relationship with the Dutch in Kellinghusen was difficult, as they harboured distrust due to my political opinions. Finally, I was the only one amongst them in the town, who had come to Germany with Nazi sympathisers. It would have been impossible to tell them my story. So, I was condemned to play my roll until the bitter end, possibly without anyone ever believing that I was a Jew from Austria and who had lived as a refugee in Holland. The first days of May until the capitulation were spent at a photocopier, making copies of documents, which Hollnack gave to me. This work had to be finished quickly, I recall only that it concerned plans, drawings and memoranda, whose contents and significance were not understood by me. I already knew that Hollnack was the Head of a Scientific team; and that he was concerned with atomic research. I do not know what happened to the photocopies and the documents. It was presumably the case that a T-Force of the British Eight Army confiscated these documents shortly after the capitulation after the house had been placed under special protection. What exactly happened to Hollnack, the Scientists, the documents and the Betatron, presumably only MI5 within the British Foreign Office can say. On the 30th April, we heard about Hitler’s suicide on the radio. The news triggered a liberating mood, yet the days leading up to the capitulation on the 5th May still caused some tension. On the 3rd May, I aired my secret to Hollnack, whereby I did not reveal everything in one sentence. Initially, I revealed that Overbeek was not my real name, which did so little to cause him disquiet as my next revelation, that I was not Dutch, but Austrian. As I went to say something else to him after much preparation, that I was not just a Jew, but a full-blood Jew, he was initially speechless. Admittedly, I let him know that I was soon to return to Holland and from there I wanted to go to Palestime to my parents. However, he now urged me to remain with him as everything will not go well for me. He explained that he had collaborated with English and American Nuclear Researchers and mentioned the name of Professor Churchill and Niels Bohr. “You will now travel to America and study at the cost of the government. I will do everything for you, for you were involved in my work for the allies” he said. I insisted on being able to go as soon as possible, as I did not want to have anything else to do with Germany and the Germans. I hoped to see my parents and build a new life in Palestime. Concerning the role Hollnack played I am still, today, not entirely clear. I presume, he played a double role, presumably he served the Air Ministry of the German Riech; on the other had he maintained relations with the Western powers. Whether he was a spy in the usual sense my opinion is divided. I also had the feeling that Hollnack now needed my support, in order to somehow cover the fact that he had kept a Jew in hiding. He meant, I should have confided in him earlier, that Fraulein Blom was a half-Jew, which he had known the whole time. He described the Jews as a gifted people; the best scientists in the world were Jews. Of course, he did not explain himself in this way. I sought an opportunity to leave Kellinghusen. At the time, there was a decree not to use the country roads which also applied to Foreigners. The return transports were organized by the army. As my relations with the Dutch in the area were cool, we, initially, did not get on, as one of the first transports went to Luneburg with the Dutch and Belgians. Finally, on the 25th May I was able to leave. Hollnack did what he could to stop me leaving; again and again he spoke of studying in America where he also intended to go. I was now given an ID document by him with the company stamp of Nuclear Researcher, which was regarded as a pass in order to pass the English cordons. Moreover, he gave me a document upon which stood that I was currently on leave. Sombin, that is, me, was now officially employed at the German Atomic Research company. I never learnt anything else about Hollnack. I travelled in an English military car in two stages to Lűneburg, where there was a transit camp for those returning. It was here that I was taken to a sick bay on suspicion of having spot typhus, as I’d arrived with food poisoning and a fever. For the first time, I saw the monstrous sight of living skeletons……, former inmates of Bergen Belsen. I was extremely impressed by the feeling of standing next to Jews and being able to say to them “I am also a Jew!” The most curious thing to me was that I had lived with a constant feeling of guilt; to see Jewish girls; at the same time to see something totally alien, which I, initially, had to relearn from memory as real. Everyone was so atomised in their inner lives and had that common feeling that, in normal times it was easier to find those belonging to the same group, had lost something substantial, even if they had been in a similar situation to me. Nevertheless, I soon recognised that it was also, perhaps, true of the former prisoners…, everyone was only an individual and only belonged to one of three groups…., English, German, or survivor. Even before you spoke to anyone, you could sense the fate suffered by those with whom you spoke. You already knew most of the details before you’d even spoken to them, so that you were overcome with the deepest sympathy. I felt numb and spent within! I remember having sat on the country road before arriving in Lűneburg when scores of ragged people, Russians, foreign labourers, released prisoners, those returning home, German Soldiers and refugees passed by….., this was a Danté-like sight; a procession of the damned. Some of the former prisoners still proved their immense vitality, when it came to the acquisition of food and clothing. Most of the people succumbed as a result of lethargy. In Lüneburg, you had to be patient, as you did not know when the next repatriations were supposed to be carried out. After a week, it was announced that the sick were to be taken to Brussels by plane. I longed to be able to escape Germany’s nightmare atmosphere and registered. About 12 men were conveyed in an RAF Dakota. Before take-off, I described myself as Palestinian, exploiting the general administrative confusion, in order to get to Palestine as quickly as possible; there were repatriation transports to almost every country in the world; even to China and Afghanistan. I simply gave a rough translation of my real name and called myself Jaakov Chaklan. In Brussels, we lived in barracks. When I heard of the possibility of travelling to Holland, I also, initially, wanted to pay a visit there. The transport I annexed myself to only got to Tilburg, as the Northern provinces were an emergency area, due to the masses of people, only allowing traffic for military purposes. I exploited the first opportunity to get to Amsterdam, where I arrived towards the end of June. I met my friend Cilly once more purely by coincidence; she had weathered the war well staying with a Farmer in Southern Holland and was now working as a Nurse. She later went to Israel. I found my Polak relatives again in the old apartment; they had survived the war hiding in a room and my sister had remained with a Gardener until the end of the war and continued to reside with him. Although I learnt nothing of my parents, I was convinced of finding them in Palestine; so I left after a stay of about a week and crossed the Belgian border illegally back to Brussels. It was there that I was given a travel document as a Palestinian to the French border by the ‘Centre des Refugiés et Repatriés’. In Mauberge, I was supposed to enter a transit camp for those returning home. Upon enquiring at a military point about a travel document to Haifa, I was put in a military car with two Poles, which drove us to the camp headquarters. Here, we had to get out and were met by a French corporal. He sent the Poles into the building, from whom I wanted to distance myself…., whereupon the corporal commanded me in military German “March! Forwards! Left! Right!” I did not know what had happened to me! I had to wait at the end of the corridor. I insisted on being directed to an English authority as a Palestinian. The corporal was, however, convinced that I was a German, who wanted to escape from being a prisoner of war by wearing civilian clothing. I spoke to him in English and French; saying I was a British subject. He didn’t want to hear anything of it and was of the opinion “that we will soon find out!” Finally, I was taken to an office, where the French officers worked. I repeated my story and requested a travel document to Haifa, whereupon I was led to an English Intelligence Officer in an adjoining room, who finally believed me, after he had taken the corresponding physical examination (this was also proof; whilst I had never aroused suspicion in the German hospitals during the war!). The officer apologised at being unable to issue a travel document to Haifa, but, however, did order the issuance of a travel document to Marseille. I still had 200 Reichsmarks salary and an advance from Hollnack, which I could not bring myself to spend until now. The English officer allowed me to exchange the entire sum into French Francs, although, normally, you were only allowed to exchange a limited amount of Reichsmarks. When I left the office, I was met, once more, by the corporal and, upon seeing my papers, could not believe what he was seeing, due to astonishment, but was, at the same time, extremely accommodating. The following day, I was able to continue my journey by train to Paris, Gare du Nord, together with North Africans and Blacks. The waiting room had been fitted out like sleeping quarters; I spent the night there. As a Palestinian, I immediately gained celebrity amongst the Repatriation Clerks; word quickly got around and I was soon sought out by Jews, who asked for my help to put in a good word for them with the Palestine Office. Unfortunately, I had to decline. A few days later, I had to travel from Gare du Lyon to Marseille. I, once again, found myself in a repatriation camp, where German prisoners of war worked in the kitchens as well as performing other tasks. I did everything to ascertain when the departure of a ship to Palestine could be expected soon. I sought out the English consulate and requested to see the Consul personally, so that I was not immediately sent away. The discussion ended in disappointment; the Consul did not believe my story, whereupon I tried to get myself put on a collection list at the Palestine Office. They were against all illegal migration attempts and were really unfriendly. I found out here from the visitors that there was a camp near Marseille, where those awaiting legal transport onwards were waiting. So, I went there! Most of the inmates of the camp were from Auschwitz, Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen. Around the 8th of June, the ‘Ascania’ was due to depart. I still saw my chance to travel legally. When American Army lorries collected the migrants on the morning of the day of departure, I simply climbed aboard and got to the ship’s quay. The loading of the ship proceeded very slowly. Initially, only those holding one-way tickets were called; then the various other lists were called in turn. I still did not know how I would manage to travel with them. When I heard that a Hungarian boy from the Buchenwald list had to remain in a Paris hospital due to illness, I decided upon the calling of his name - I only remember his forename was Sandor - to go in his place. As soon as the name was called, I went resolutely, yet as harmlessly as possible, past the various checkpoints on the quay and onto the ship; always expecting that the name would be called once more, perhaps out of concern that the real Sandor could appear. I passed so self-certainly and as quickly as possible all of the tables and was given a number by the Steward, with which I hastily disappeared below deck. A while later, the presumed, real Sandor registered and after a long discussion was allowed to board the ship. A few days later, it was found out that this Sandor too had only repeated the trick; it was a boy from Poland and not Hungary. The real Sandor really was in Paris! We had to change ship in Naples. During our stay in the port, a Kapo from Buchenwald was recognised…., they wanted to lynch him. At the last moment, members of the English military came aboard ship and led him away under violent protest of the former prisoners. From Naples, we travelled for five days to Haifa. Whilst still on the high seas, a motorboat approached and some functionaries of the Jewish Agency came aboard, whose considerable task it was, to find illegal immigrants and help them as much as possible. In total, there were sixteen! Initially, we were accused of having taken the documents of others for our own use…., yet, we were still assisted, as the Jewish Agency constantly had a number of reserve documents to hand. On the 16th June 1945, I arrived in the quarantine camp, Atlith. I wrote to my sister, Elli’s address from Marseille, with whom I had corresponded via the Red Cross until 1943. In this way, my dependents and surviving family were informed of my intention to go to Erez. After two weeks in Atlith, I was able to shake my father’s hand through the barbed-wire. Translator’s Notes The German word ‘untertaucht’ (submerged) has here been translated as ‘in hiding’. The German term ‘unter Wasser’ (under water) has here been translated as ‘hidden’. The German compound noun ‘Untergrund’ (underground) has here been translated as ‘Resistance’. The German noun ‘Stichtag’ (Qualifying date) has here been translated as ‘Judgment day’. The German noun ‘Dachboden’ (attic, loft) has here been translated as ‘attic’, not only as it connotes a larger space than a loft, but also due to the fact that the word ‘loft’ is very UK-centric and the Translator wishes to reach a larger audience. The German phrase ‘bewusst Jüdisch’ (consciously Jewish) has here been translated as ‘devout Jewish’. The German phrase ‘Herrenhaus’, relating to a Lord’s Manor/Estate, has been translated as ‘landed property’, as the Translator is of the opinion that it will be more broadly understood. The German noun ‘Keks’ (cookie) seems to the Translator too American, and has, thus opted for the more conservate translation of ‘biscuit’. The German compound noun ‘Arbeitsamt’ would, today, refer to a Jobcentre. In the 1940s’, the correct phraseology would be ‘Labour Exchange’. The German noun ‘Viertel’ (quarter) has been translated as ‘District’ to connote those areas forbidden to Jews. The German compound noun ‘Werbestellen’ (advertising points) has here been translated as ‘Recruitment Offices’, as they were manned posts for enlistment into the SS. The German noun ‘Dämmerung’ (twilight) gives no indication as to whether it concerns dawn or dusk. The Translator has, therefore, opted for the neutral ‘twilight hours’. The German noun ‘Gärtnerei’ (Gardening) has here been translated as ‘kitchen gardening’, due to its utility purposes. The Dutch compound noun ‘Persoonsbewijs’ has here been translated as ‘Dutch ID card’. The German compound noun ‘Werkdorf’ has been here translated as ‘industrial village’, as the German noun ‘Werk’ relates to manual work. ‘Wurde populär’ in German literally means ‘became popular’. The Translator believes this understates the popularity gained by the Author when he was discovered to be Palestinian. The Translator has, therefore, opted for the term ‘gained celebrity’. The German plural noun ‘Häuser’ (Houses) has here been translated as ‘buildings’ to maintain a generic of a myriad of properties. The German ‘Stadtgrenze’ (City border) has here been translated as ‘outskirts of the city’ for purposes of reader comprehension. The German ‘die Hände faltete’ (folded the hands) has here been translated as ‘put my hands together’ to denote a prelude to prayer. The German ‘Bombardements’ (bombings) has here been translated as ‘air-raids’ to denote clearly where the bombs came from. The German ‘Birnen und Äpfeln’ (pears and apples) in order to avoid trivialisation, as well as the interference of Cockney rhyming slang (apples and pears = stairs) has here been translated as ‘apples, pears and other fruits’). The German term ‘kurz entschlossen’ (shortly decided) has here been translated as ‘snap decision’. The German noun ‘Schlupfwinkel’ (hovel, hidey-hole) has here been translated as ‘hiding place’. ‘Bohnenkaffee’ (bean coffee) has here been translated as ‘real coffee’ to inform the reader that an Ersatz (substitute) variety was not being drunk. The German ‘Wirtschaftskarte’ (Economy/Economic Card) relates to a pass issued by the German Government to allow access to work. The Translator has, therefore, opted to translate the term as ‘Economic Activity Card’. ‘ausgestorbene Dörfer’ (extinct villages) has here been translated as ‘dead quietude of the villages’ to convey the sense, but not the reality, of desertion the author depicts. ‘Flugzettel der Alliierten’ (Allied flyers) is slightly confusing in that the reader could mistake the pamphlets (Flugzettel) for pilots’ (fliers). The Translator has, therefore, adopted the phrase ‘Allied letter drops’ to convey the fact that the pamphlets were dropped by planes. ‘Űberschwemmungen’ (excesses, inundations) has here been translated as ‘masses of people’ to describe, not only the excess numbers, but also the form they took. There is no reference in the translation as to what a D-Zug is. In German, a Zug is a train and ‘D’ is the usual symbol for ‘German’ (Deutsch). It is, thus, assumed that reference is being made to a train on the German national railway system. The Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science is a formally independent non-governmental and non-profit association of the German Research Institutes’ publicly funded by the federal and the 16 state Governments of Germany. It is named in honour of its former President, theoretical Physicist, Max Planck. The Max Planck Institutes’ (82 in 2013) focus on excellence in research in the interest of the general public in the natural, life and social sciences, as well as the arts and humanities. Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie. (BBC) was a Swiss group of electrical engineering companies founded in Baden, Switzerland in 1891 by Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown and Walter Boveri. The company produced DC motors, AC motors, generators, steam and gas turbines, transformers and the electrical equipment of locomotives. Some of their technology went into German U-boats in World War II, such as the depth controls. The original NSKK was founded under the name of NSAK (National Socialist Automobile Corps) on 1, April 1930 by Hitler, who joined as its first member. By the end of 1931, it had a membership of approximately 10,0, as compared to 300 at the beginning of the year. In 1934, the motorised Hitler Youth and the motorised SA were placed under the NSKK. On 23rd August of that year, Hitler declared that they were both welded together into a unit called the NSKK, being directly subordinate to Hitler. NSKK-trained men were intended to be assimilated into Reich Panzer Units. It was said of those Germans entering motorised units, that their only ambition was to become a tank soldier. Rolf Widerøe (11 July 1902 - 11 October 1996) was a Norwegian Accelerator Physicist, who was the originator of many particle acceleration concepts, including the resonance accelerator and the betatron accelerator. IN 1925, he studied at the Technical University in Aachen, where he proposed a thesis in 1927 for an experimental betatron accelerator, which was not successful at first. Widerøe, instead, built a linear accelerator prototype. He began collaborating with the Nazi German government following their election in Germany. For this, his Norwegian citizenship was ultimately revoked. Rolf Widerøe died on 11th October 1996 in Obersiggenthal, Switzerland. A betatron is a cyclic particle accelerator developed by Donald Kerst at the University of Illinois in 1940 to accelerate electrons, but the concepts ultimately originate from Rolf Widerøe, whose development of an induction accelerator failed due to lack of transverse focusing. The betatron is, essentially, a transformer with a torus-shaped vacuum tube as its secondary coil. An alternating current in the primary coils accelerates electrons in the vacuum around a circular path. The betatron was the first important machine for producing high-energy electrons. Shag, also known as rolling tobacco, loose tobacco, baccy and rollies, is fine-cut tobacco used to make self-made cigarettes by hand rolling the tobacco into rolling paper or injecting it into filter tubes. It got its name from the firmly-cut strands appearing like ‘shag’ and was originally considered poor quality.

At the Nuremberg trials, he was found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death. ‘J’attendrai’ (French for ‘I will wait’) is a French popular song recorded by Rina Ketty in 1938. It is a translation of an Italian song ‘Tornerai’ (Italian for ‘You will return’) composed by Dino Olivieri (music) and Nino Rastelli (lyrics) in 1933, inspired from the Humming Chorus of Puccini’s opera ‘Madame Butterfly’. Achieving great popularity in its day, the song has since come to be seen as emblematic of the start of World War II. The Hollandshe Schouwberg is a war monument. Between 1893 and 1942, it was a theatre. It was a gathering / deportation area in 1942/3. In 1941, it was renamed the ‘Joodsche Schouwberg’, where Jewish musicians could appear. In 1942/3, the Schouwberg, lying at the heart of the old Amsterdam Jewish quarter, was used by the Germans as a gathering / deportation area. In November 1958, the Council of Amsterdam made it an official war monument. Vught is a municipality and a town in the southern Netherlands. It is a town where lots of commuters live and has been voted ‘best place to live’ by the Dutch magazine Elsevier. Vught is known for having been the site of a transit / concentration camp (Herzogenbusch) built by Nazi Germany during its occupation of the Netherlands. The camp held male and female prisoners, many of the Jewish and political activists, captured in Belgium and the Netherlands. Vught was liberated by the Canadians at the end of Word War II, but only after the German guards had killed several hundred prisoners there. Amersfoort is a municipality and the second largest city of the province of Utrecht in central Netherlands. The city is growing quickly, but has a well-preserved and protected medieval centre. The Westerbork transit camp was a World War II Nazi refugee detention and transit camp in Hooghalen, 10 kilometres north of Westerbork in the north-east Netherlands. Its function during the Second Word War was to assemble Romani and Dutch Jews for transport to other concentration camps. The Canadian 2nd Infantry Division liberated the several hundred inhabitants, who were still at Westerbork on 12, April 1945. Rivierenbuurt in the south of Amsterdam was built in the 1920s’ and all street names bear the names of rivers. It is where the affluent and middle-classes live. The architecture is in the Amsterdam School style; notable proponents of which are.., Michel de Klerk and Piet Kramer. In the 1930s’, more and more affluent Jews took up residence in this area, leading to the Germans clearing the area of Jews; transporting them to concentration camps. The Jodenbuurt (Dutch: ‘Jewish neighbourhood’) lies in Amsterdam. For centuries before World War II, it was the centre of the Jews in Amsterdam. It is best known as the home of Rembrandt and the Jewish ghetto of the Nazi occupation of Holland. Three major raids took place within it and hundreds of Jews were deported to the ‘East’. Now, virtually empty, it stayed that way until the end of the war. The Hunger Winter of 1944/5 saw many buildings demolished to feed stoves and fireplaces. Today, little remains of the once thriving Jewish neighbourhood; many houses being demolished and replaced with large apartment blocks. The RMS Ascania was an ocean liner operated by the Cunard Line. On 24, August 1939, she was taken into naval service and converted into an armed merchant cruiser. She became HMS Ascania. She took part in the invasion of Sicily in 1943, the Anzio landings and the landings in the south of France in 1944. Within the Jewish faith, a Minjan is a quorum of 10 or more verbal Jews in the religious sense necessary to conduct a full Jewish service within a Synagogue.

The Womens’ International Zionist Organisation (WIZO) is a volunteer organisation dedicated to social welfare in all sectors of Israeli society, the advancement of the status of women and Jewish education in Israel and the Diaspora. Founded in England on 7, July 1920 by Rebecca Sieff, Dr Vera Weizmann (the wife of Israel’s first President, Dr Chaim Weizmann), Edith Eder, Romana Goodman and Henrietta Irwell to provide community services for the residents of the Mandate of Palestine. WIZO branches opened across Europe, but many were closed down in the wake of Nazi occupation and the Holocaust. In 1949, after the establishment of the state of Israel, WIZO moved its headquarters to Israel and Sieff became President of the World WIZO organisation. Youth Alijah (Hebrew: Aliyat Hano’ar) is a Jewish organisation that rescued thousands of Jewish children from the Nazis during the Third Reich. Youth Alijah arranged for their resettlement in Palestine in kibbutzim and youth villages that became both home and school. Recha Freier, a Rabbi’s wife, founded Youth Alijah in Berlin on the same day Adolf Hitler took power, Monday 30, January 1933. The organisation was founded to protect German Jewish youth from the impending Holocaust by sending them to pioneer training camps in Palestine after completing elementary school. The idea was supported by the World Zionist Organisation. A Zionist youth movement is an organisation formed for Jewish children and adolescents for educational, social and ideological development, including a belief in Jewish nationalism as represented in the state of Israel. Youth leaders in modern youth movements use informal educational approaches to educate towards the movement’s ideological goals. The Patria disaster was the sinking on the 25th November 1940 by the Haganah of a French-built ocean liner, the 11,885-ton SS Patria, in the port of Haifa, killing 267 people and injuring 172. At the time of the sinking, the Patria was carrying about 1,800 Jewish Refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe, whom the British authorities were deporting from Mandatory Palestine to Mauritius, because they lacked entry permits. Zionist organisations opposed the deportation and the underground paramilitary Haganah group planted a bomb intended to disable the ship and prevent it leaving the port of Haifa. However, the Haganah miscalculated the effects of the explosion and the bomb sank the ship in less than 16 minutes, trapping hundreds in the hold. The British allowed the survivors to remain in Palestine on humanitarian grounds. Abel Jacob Herzberg (17 September 1893 - 19 May 1989) was a Dutch-Jewish Lawyer, Writer and Poet.

They worked as a team, starting in September 1939 and ending in January 1943. Today, the discovered parts of the collection are referred to as the Ringelblum Archive located at the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, Poland. The name oneg Shabbat means ‘Joys of the Sabbath’ and, usually, refers to a celebratory gathering held after Sabbath services. Gideon Drach was born in 1916 in Munich," Germany.

57,"['In spite of their Turkish nationality the author and the author's wife were arrested in their Turkish nationality the author and his wife's lodgings in Amsterdam on 22 September 1943. This report includes details on the ‘Centre For Jewish Emigration’, Joodsche Schouwburg and Westerbork (description in detail). the author and the author's wife departed to Bergen-Belsen in January 1944, together with about 1,000 refugees. Ill-treatment, starvation, diseases; death rate 25-40 daily, increasing later. In June 1944, the author was transferred to the so-called Schneebaum-Lager, later Aufenthaltslager Benadon for Jews of neutral nationality (p.6). Here were only 250 refugees instead of a 4,000 in the common camp (Albala camp) in which conditions were much worse, especially after the common camp (Albala camp) dismissal, when a Christian Hanke, assisted by Christian Kapos took over (p.7). From January 1945, many thousand prisoners arrived from other camps, all in a pitiable state (p.7). 105 persons belonging to the Turkish group were released on 4 March 1945. 105 persons belonging to the Turkish group went to Sweden via Luebeck, where 105 persons belonging to the Turkish group met with the Turkish group from Ravensbruck and the Turkish students. On 10 April, the author arrived in Istanbul. 8. References : Dr. Pick from Vienna, doctor at the quarantine at Westerbork (p.15). Camp Commander at Bergen-Belsen Haas (p.4).

Remarks : See related report by the same author report No. 294b. for further information. Bergen-Belsen After having been spared for a long time from home raids and street checks on account of our Turkish papers, the author's wife and I (my wife and I had left the author's daughter Malkitta with Aryans from the Netherlands in the provincial town of Helmond under the name of Rietje) were taken away by two plain-clothed Dutch policemen. According to two plain-clothed Dutch policemen, my wife and I were being taken to a hearing at the Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung (Central Department for Jewish Emigration) at Adama von Schletemaplein in Istanbul, with a view to a speedy return. my wife and I had been given permission to keep a packed suitcase with Jewish neighbours (which would potentially be forwarded to the Westerbork camp). In the meantime, the authorities allowed my wife and I to enjoy my wife and I's breakfast. my wife and I went by foot to the nearest police station. There my wife and I were put in a truck and taken to the Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung (Central Department for Jewish Emigration).” There my wife and I had to wait alone in a basement room equipped with chairs and benches, before being taken to the chief of the security services. my wife and I were informed that, owing to a special order lying in front of the chief of the security services from The Hague, my wife and I were being sent to a work detail in Westerbork. my wife and I's Turkish nationality was not recognised in The Hague (in June my wife and I had seen the official Fraulein Slottke in The Hague, who, on the basis of the papers presented, had compiled a comprehensive transcript). the official Fraulein Slottke in The Hague, who, on the basis of the papers presented, had compiled a comprehensive transcript gave my wife and I back the money taken by two plain-clothed Dutch policemen, but kept the ration cards. All of my wife and I's objections were brusquely rejected. my wife and I were led back to the basement room. After a long and anxious wait, the police officer, who had taken my wife and I away, emerged in a state of agitation and asked for the whereabouts of my wife and I's child. my wife and I gave evasive answers and were led to a room, in which several German officers and female SS helpers were, who were by all means necessary trying to find where my wife and I's child was. my wife and I had invented the following story: on the day of a big raid, that morning during the author's absence (the author worked at the Joodschen Raad) a male stranger came to the author's wife and offered to take our child) into safety. In the understandable commotion of the day of a big raid, the author's wife agreed without asking the name of a male stranger. When the author arrived home the author was angered by this, but reconciled the author that, as a Turkish citizen, nothing unlawful would come of it. This was met with an unhappy response and they proceeded upon my wife and I with threats and insults. my wife and I remained steadfast and further explained how my wife and I did not know the whereabouts of my wife and I's child. my wife and I were told that my wife and I would be put on a penal transport. Accompanied by an SS man, my wife and I were taken in a small car to the Jewish theatre, Joodschen Schouwburg. Thanks to an ingenious manoeuvre by an employee present at the Joodschen Raad, my wife and I were fortunately not recorded on the list of criminal cases, but on the normal transport list instead. the Jewish theatre, Joodschen Schouwburg was where all Istanbul Jews listed for deportation - 2 - were assembled prior to all Amsterdam Jews listed for deportation - 2 -'s onward travel to Westerbork. During the night the majority – if the majority were not sleeping on the dirtiest and most vermin-infested of mattresses – had to sit on chairs. Victuals and other services, above all the provisions for the further transport, were provided by the employees of the Joodschen Raad in an exemplary fashion. Above all, by using all possible reasons to defer, an employee present at the Joodschen Raad endeavoured to hold back people for as long as possible (there were people who had remained there for many weeks), and now and again an employee present at the Joodschen Raad succeeded in allowing some to disappear. Even though my wife and I only had to stay there for half a day, my wife and I were still sufficiently depressed by the Jewish theatre, Joodschen Schouwburg. On that day, a transport day, SS made an unpleasant visit to the “desert sons.” A nurse, who could not hear well, and who was in the lavatory at the time of the transport list rollcall, was beaten, pulled by the hair, and kicked. my wife and I had to endure the most salacious insults thrown at my wife and I and not move. Finally, to my wife and I's relief, they marched off. In large motorcoaches my wife and I were, together with approximately 200 people (a “small” transport), taken to the strictly-guarded railway trains, which took my wife and I to the the Jewish theatre, Joodschen Schouwburg camp. my wife and I arrived there in the night. To my wife and I's surprise my wife and I were received in a large and well-lit room, in which Jewish workers from the Jewish theatre, Joodschen Schouwburg's registry sat in long rows at typewriters and took down my wife and I's details. Afterwards my wife and I were greeted by my wife and I's friends and acquaintances. our friends and acquaintances immediately took into custody anything of value. Afterwards my wife and I had to pass the office of the Bank Lippmann and Rosenthal, where money, valuables and ration stamps were being taken by the wicked Dutch officers, with bags and briefcases etc. also being searched. After a brief search in quarantine my wife and I there then taken to the penal barrack no. 67, where my wife and I initially stayed until the next day. On the next day, those, like us, who had no criminal record, were taken to a different barrack. my wife and I came to barrack 66, where my wife and I remained until my wife and I's departure to Bergen-Belsen in January 1944. The Westerbork transit camp, located in the northern Dutch province of Drenthe, near the town of Assen, originated out of a camp built by the Dutch government in 1939 for Jewish refugees following the events in Germany in November 1938. As “old camp inmates,” the Jews who were still there from this time had a preferential position and carried out all important administrative functions in The Westerbork transit camp, located in the northern Dutch province of Drenthe, near the town of Assen. For the purposes of transportations of Jews to the East, The Westerbork transit camp, located in the northern Dutch province of Drenthe, near the town of Assen was greatly enlarged, with living, working, and administrative barracks provided. Owing to the vast camp terrain one had free movement, and only rarely was there a commandant (often in plain clothes) or an SS man to be seen, who all lived outside of The Westerbork transit camp, located in the northern Dutch province of Drenthe, near the town of Assen. Every person fit for work - 3 - had to carry out work, be it in one of the basic camp range of services (administration, office duty, security, the kitchen, the hospital, the school, workshops, camp cleaning etc.), or in “industry” (battery disassembly, old metal sorting, sorting beans etc.). Food was administered as such: morning coffee, at lunch a stew (mostly a “stamppot” in a Dutch style, i.e. potatoes and vegetables cooked together). In the hospital where the author's wife worked there was better food. In addition, a large proportion of the camp inmates received food packages from outside, which were only allowed to be sent once a month, however. There were talks on a variety of things in a similar way to an organised school lesson. On high holidays there was a well-attended service. There was even a large theatre hall where satirical and musical performances took place (the German commandant was a regular guest). the hospital where my wife worked there boasted a comparatively large number of barracks and good doctors. This relatively bearable existence – considering the conditions of camps in Germany and Poland – was nevertheless under the constant threat of transportations, where once or twice a week in numbers from 1,000 to 3,000, people were sent to Auschwitz and other eastern camps. The transport lists were read out in the middle of the night by the barrack leaders in the barracks. The atmosphere at the readings resembled a death sentence. Apart from the officials on duty, no one was allowed into the transport carriages themselves. The transportation days placed great stress on the nerves of everybody, but also provided many examples of mutual support. At the beginning the author worked in the cleaning detail. At first, the author had to drive the refuse bins from the hospital barracks to the waste pits situated outside The Westerbork transit camp, located in the northern Dutch province of Drenthe, near the town of Assen. Then the author had to keep the hospital where my wife worked there clean with a brush, hoe, shovel and wheelbarrow. Later the author was assigned to quarantine. There the author had to take out the disinfected clothes from the hot air chambers, which remained at 120-130% for two hours, and then bundle the disinfected clothes up and make the disinfected clothes available for collection. The work hours amounted to seven hours. my wife and I got a daily bath and later an extra 200g of fat as an extra allowance. In the quarantine, which was under the leadership of the Viennese physician Dr Pick, the baptised were very well represented, and lived in a special barrack. On January 11th, 1944, my wife and I went together with the first transport to Bergen-Belsen. For the most part, the first transport to Bergen-Belsen was comprised of applicants for the Palestine exchange, holders of South American passports, and dual citizens. One was told the nicest things about The Westerbork transit camp, located in the northern Dutch province of Drenthe, near the town of Assen, and the remaining inmates envied my wife and I. my wife and I travelled through the night in a third-class carriage (for transports to the East there were only ever cattle cars) – across the the Dutch government border for the first time in 11 years – Auschwitz to Bergen, where my wife and I arrived early in the morning on January 12th. - 4 - The situation immediately became clear to my wife and I upon arrival. At the platform stood numerous SS men with fixed weapons and dogs, who greeted my wife and I with “Raus! Raus!” and “Schnell! Schnell!” The camp commandant, Haas, a large and stocky man with a sinister look, observed the performance with great interest. Women with small children and large suitcases were loaded into trucks. All the others had to walk with all All the others's hand luggage. The 1000-long line moved in a slow march across the country road. After 1 ½ hours, my wife and I arrived at a black and white barrier to The Westerbork transit camp, located in the northern Dutch province of Drenthe, near the town of Assen. When all my wife and I could see on all sides was barbed wire, weathered barracks, and signs such as “political prisoners,” “arms depot,” etc., it became ever clearer to my wife and I that all positive reports were just fantasy and that my wife and I had arrived in a German Nazi camp. After an endless wait (my wife and I did not receive anything to eat for the whole day), of role calls, registration and turning in money, my wife and I were divided into barracks. two plain-clothed Dutch policemen screamed, insulted and commanded. Everything had to be done quickly. Hurrying, harrying and improvisation were the hallmarks of camp life in Bergen-Belsen. The barracks – in a dismal grey-green – were comprised of a dining hall with cupboards and tables, and a dormitory with wooden bunk beds. the author went into a barrack with a connecting washroom (the occupants in other barracks had to go the dirtiest of routes in all weathers to a connecting washroom). Male and female camps were divided with barbed wire; the gate closed in the evenings. Upon my wife and I's arrival in Bergen-Belsen, my wife and I found a group of roughly 80 Greek Jews who had left Westerbork destined for Westerbork, without ever having heard anything from a group of roughly 80 Greek Jews who had left Westerbork destined for Theresienstadt, without ever having heard anything from them. a group of roughly 80 Greek Jews who had left Westerbork destined for Theresienstadt, without ever having heard anything from them were later put on transport from Bergen-Belsen to Westerbork. The hospital (referred to as Revier) made a very poor impression. When my wife and I were there with my wife and I's child to remove a boil from the back of a group of roughly 80 Greek Jews who had left Westerbork destined for Theresienstadt, without ever having heard anything from them's head, in the operating room there was literally nothing apart from an operating table and an instrument cabinet with three rusted pairs of scissors. Consequently, the doctor had to use the author's own pair of scissors with a sterile gauze which my wife and I had with my wife and I. Shortly after my wife and I's arrival the author was taken ill to The hospital (referred to as Revier with facial erysipelas. The (new, second) barracks were divided with a row of cabinets into male and female sections. There was neither a lavatory nor a washroom. A waste bin served as a lavatory and had to be carried to and fro by the nurse, and if A waste bin was overflowing A waste bin was carried by two helpers. The lighting and heating were insufficient. The medical administration was very perfunctory, and the German staff surgeon mostly only came to determine who to discharge. (Later the conditions in The hospital (referred to as Revier improved). - 5 - (There were more doctors, even specialists appointed, as well as even more nurses. There was even an outpatient clinic and a dentist. Towards the end of my wife and I's stay in Bergen-Belsen, with the reduction of space, the conditions in the hospital became much worse). After a few days my wife and I were divided up for work. As a mother to a child of under three years, the author's wife did not have to work. the author was put into the so-called Schuhkommando, whose task it was, in poorly heated and dusty stone barracks, to remove the rubber part from the leather from a pile of shoes as high as a house. At 6 o’clock in the morning, one had to report for roll call. Then one marched in a long line in rows of five to the work barracks. One was forced to work there until midday. In every barrack there was a Jewish foreman. The SS-Oberscharführer who was supervising alternated from barrack to barrack and pushed my wife and I towards higher work output with threats and insults. Later, more and more were beaten, with kicks and leather straps. Various people were so badly treated that Various people had to be taken to the hospital. Later the author came to the Bekleidungskommando (clothing Kommando), which operated in the magazine of the Dutch government. The engagement involved loading and unloading, hauling things to and fro, piling up and counting military equipment from steel helmets to boots. the Bekleidungskommando (clothing Kommando), which operated in the magazine of the Waffen-SS had a Hauptscharführer (sergeant major), with an Unterscharführer and several SS men of Lithuanian and Romanian descent reporting to a Hauptscharführer (sergeant major). The work was harder than in the Bekleidungskommando (clothing Kommando), which operated in the magazine of the Waffen-SS, yet not as depressing, as The work was more varied and one could be out in the fresh air. The surveillance was in such a way that sleights of hand were possible, such as holding Hebrew courses, reading books or sleeping. Lunchtime lasted 45 minutes and was enough to: march in single file back to the Appelplatz (roll call area), walk quickly inside the work barracks, wait in line to receive a warm meal (mostly swede soup, with boiled potatoes to start with, later on without), quickly gulp down the ¾ litres of soup, rush to drop by the author's wife and child, and finally report back to the Appelplatz (roll call area) for roll call. One returned home in the evenings at 6.45pm. One washed and hurried (one always hurried in Bergen-Belsen) to The barracks – in a dismal grey-green – in order to share the meagre bread ration and filling with my wife for the evening meal (for a long time there was a thin soup served on certain evenings). One had to be back in one’s barracks by 8 o’clock. There one could still read for a short time, listen to a talk, discuss the chances of liberation and the current situation in the war (based on the most recent Jüdische Presse Agentur (JPA) rumours), or argue about internal barrack matters. Then one would fall asleep, exhausted. Special occasions within The Westerbork transit camp, located in the northern Dutch province of Drenthe, near the town of Assen were the roll calls for the non-workers (women, the elderly, children), which often lasted for several hours, - 6 - who willingly stood in bad weather (one time for eleven hours without food) when SS forgot to count one person. my wife and I even had to stand for the roll call for hours on end in the evening when my wife and I came back exhausted from work. Punishments involved the deprivation of food, being made to stay at the gate without standing or food for hours on end, relocation to a particularly arduous or dirty Kommando, or spending several days in the bunker on just water and bread. Beatings at the start were very rare, but later on became very commonplace, carried out with leather belts or rifle butts. From March 1st the Bekleidungskommando (clothing Kommando), which operated in the magazine of the Waffen-SS were not allowed to wear jackets anymore. During the official non-work hours on Sunday afternoons, my wife and I were regularly fetched to carry out work of all kinds often just out of harassment. In some particularly difficult outdoor Kommandos, only the elderly were employed. In all weathers they had to dig up tree roots, saw wood, haul tree trunks etc., all with inadequate equipment and suffering ill-treatment. One was only excused from work, like in all other Kommandos, when one had a fever of more than 39 degrees. Whoever was very ill but did not meet the minimum fever requirement still had to do the roll call and go to work. The barrack authorities of SS enforced this order, and it happened often enough that ill persons were taken from ill persons's beds and forced to work. The number of deaths increased constantly and varied from 25 to 40 each day. Causes of death were above all pneumonia, starvation with the associated diarrhoea, camp fever, even typhoid fever. The later-built, so-called “Altersheim” (old peoples’ home), whose inmates were exempted from work and roll calls, became more and more a preparation station for the crematorium. Mystery surrounded the later disappearance of two young Chalutzim, who lived cut off from the outside world in a small wooden shelter on the way to the crematorium. As the crematorium later became insufficient, corpses were collected and burned in open spaces. At the beginning of June 1944, my wife and I were called up along with other Turks and Argentinians, and taken to the so-called Schneebaum Lager, the camp for Jews of neutral nationality. A few days after my wife and I's arrivals, due to the change of the camp elder, the name was changed to “Aufenthaltslager (detention camp) Benadon.” After my wife and I had been put together in the Albala camp initially with Dutch and stateless (formally German) Jews, then later with Frenchmen, Albanians, Tripolitanian Englishmen, Italians, South Americans, and all other possible nationalities (together around 4000 people), in the so-called Schneebaum Lager, the camp for Jews of neutral nationality there were around 250 persons, two thirds of whom Spanish, and the rest of Turkish, Argentinian, Portuguese and Swiss nationality. The marked improvement was that, apart from internal camp duties, there was no forced labour. Even the food was, by all means in the beginning, better: the hot food was more generous and substantial, with a larger bread topping. - 7 - There was sufficient time for lectures and studies. Minyan was regularly held. Even a Sefer Torah and a shofar were available. Talks in Spanish and French were held (and the author spoke about the Jews in Poland and the role of Jewish Palestine in the Middle East). In spite of all of this, the state of health in the Bekleidungskommando (clothing Kommando), which operated in the magazine of the Waffen-SS constantly decreased, if at least not as quickly or to the same extent in the Bekleidungskommando (clothing Kommando), which operated in the magazine of the Waffen-SS. The diet here was permanently and wholly insufficient, and all the appearances of malnourishment were on show here. There was no doctor in the so-called Schneebaum Lager, the camp for Jews of neutral nationality. Very seldom came the staff surgeon or one of the Jewish doctors from the so-called Schneebaum Lager, the camp for Jews of neutral nationality. The administration of medicine was insufficient. For the first time in August, and then again for several weeks in September and October 1944, the author's wife was taken to the hospital in the so-called Schneebaum Lager, the camp for Jews of neutral nationality with a severe and lengthy case of typhus, which owing to the poor operating methods took long to diagnose. It was in this time that my wife had the opportunity to convince my wife of the rapid deterioration of conditions there. Due to the constant lack of space, three-storey beds were put tightly next to one another where the bunk beds were, and several people had to sleep in one bed. It often happened that one would wake up in the morning next to a dead person. The lavatories and washrooms were wholly insufficient. For hours, and sometimes days, there was no water. More and more people were escaping. The punishments became ever more draconian: the Jewish theatre, Joodschen Schouwburg went without bread for three days because someone had burned straw in the oven from their mattress. If someone tried to take a turnip or a potato from the kitchen, they were beaten half to death and either put in the bunker or put on the gate for a whole day, with turnips or potatoes in their hands, and a sign around their neck saying, “I am a thief. I stole from my comrades.” During the author's visit to the hospital (after every food distribution the author was allowed to take the rations to the author's wife), the author was shocked every time by something new in the appearance of people in the so-called Schneebaum Lager, the camp for Jews of neutral nationality. people in the general camp were emaciated, with pale skin and swollen from hunger, trudging arduously on people in the general camp's weak legs. Each time the author's wife would tell the author of a group of friends and associates who had died since the last visit. Later the camp elder at Albala was dismissed, and in the camp elder at Albala's place came a non-Jew by the name of Hanke, who brought with a non-Jew by the name of Hanke, who brought with him a squad of non-Jewish Kapos a squad of non-Jewish Kapos. a squad of non-Jewish Kapos were armed with canes, which a squad of non-Jewish Kapos got generous use out of. As early as five o’clock a squad of non-Jewish Kapos would appear in the barracks and beat the people out of bed. In January 1945, when Bergen-Belsen began to be converted into a concentration camp, and thousands upon thousands of Jews and non-Jews came from Auschwitz, Birkenau, Ravensbrück, and Oranienburg, my wife and I had to leave the Bekleidungskommando (clothing Kommando), which operated in the magazine of the Waffen-SS. Fortunately, my wife and I only had to squeeze into another barrack for two weeks. - 8 - There were not enough beds: a few had to sleep in the gangway, and two of whom soon died after. The long roll call was abandoned, and the food had to be eaten on the beds. Even during my wife and I's stay in the so-called Schneebaum Lager, the camp for Jews of neutral nationality, large transports of women and girls (all without children) came from Auschwitz and other concentration camps. my wife and I had to stay in the barracks during the near approach of these tightly-packed shapes, who arrived emaciated, in clogs and without jackets. my wife and I could still large transports of women and girls (all without children) out of the window. large transports of women and girls (all without children) were accommodated in a tent camp in the rain and snow, without any wash facilities or lavatories. Water was administered through a hose for one hour a day (whilst the majority of large transports of women and girls (all without children) were already out at work, and out of necessity were digging holes). The tents regularly blew and washed away, so the women had to stand around all night soaked through in an open space. Many died because of this. Later, the women did not go past my wife and I's barracks, and instead were redirected into The Westerbork transit camp, located in the northern Dutch province of Drenthe, near the town of Assen. When my wife and I were in the so-called Schneebaum Lager, the camp for Jews of neutral nationality, the transports would pile up from the concentration camps. the transports came night and day. the transports were forced into a barrack, fully unclothed, and received a shirt, trousers, a dress and footwear. Even the bread that they had with them was taken away from them. Some of the SS women took pleasure in throwing the rest of Even the bread that they had with them over the camp fence, which many of my wife and I's hungry people then fought over. During the night my wife and I heard anxious screams from the women driven into the barracks, drowned out by the commands of SS. the author's wife witnessed a group of men in the open space forced to fully undress (it was in February and the snow had set), only to wait two hours to be then dressed in striped cotton prisoners’ uniform. Women and men from all the occupied European nations came from these transports. my wife and I's last stay in Bergen-Belsen was in a complex of old, primitive and dirty barracks right at the end of The Westerbork transit camp, located in the northern Dutch province of Drenthe, near the town of Assen. There was an old and squalid washroom. The most terrible was the lavatory – just one for men and women. the lavatory – just one for men and women had never been excavated and was difficult to clean off the coarsest of dirt. To get to the washroom and lavatory one had to walk a long way through mud. The food provision was noticeably worse and more disorderly that my wife and I often went without coffee or food at 11 o’clock, and sometimes did not get anything until 5 o’clock. One day all food rations were reduced to a quarter. There was no talk of any medical administration. The formerly weekly warm shower had discontinued for some time. The water often failed to materialise for a long time. All the more, The water leaked through the roof, so my wife and I had to put several bowls out to stop my wife and I's beds and clothes from getting soaked to some degree. Furthermore, it was, like in all other Kommandos, always terribly cold. During the whole winter the author constantly had cold feet and whenever it was possible my wife and I would lay in bed together. During the evening it was mostly dark, due to the regular air-raid alarm or alleged cost-cutting measures. Often the dim light - 9 - went out during the meal. There were 105 people of my wife and I who belonged to the Turkish group, happy when my wife and I were told on February 28th that my wife and I were to make my wife and I ready for the replacement transport on March 4th, when my wife and I's departure really was going to happen (the Spaniards and the others were to travel later in the evening that same day). my wife and I went by train to Lubeck, where my wife and I met my wife and I from Ravensbruck and the Turkish students, and then onto Flensburg through Sweden to Helsingoer, where my wife and I stayed for a few days, and then from Helsingborg in Sweden to Goteborg. On March 15th my wife and I departed on the Appelplatz (roll call area) and arrived in Istanbul on April 10th. Dr. Rudolf Levy.

58,"['Mrs Milman, née Büchler, was born in 1928 in Puchow in Czechoslovakia. In 1942 both Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s brothers were deported. Mrs Milman, née Büchler, went into hiding, escaping from place to place, and on several occasions living in the open forest. Once Mrs Milman, née Büchler, was given refuge by the wife of a Policeman, though without a Policeman's knowledge. In Modva Mrs Milman, née Büchler, attended a Protestant girl’s boarding school, which had taken on a group of converted Jewish girls. Many of a group of converted Jewish girls were taken away by the SD in 1944. Mrs Milman, together with 60 other Jews was hidden by farmers in a forest near Piestany until the end of the war. 8. References : Non-Jews helping Jews. Illegal Life in Czechoslovakia Report on the “underground” experiences in Slovakia 1939-1945 based on the information from Mrs. Livia Milman, born Buechler, on the 29th February 1928 in Puchov, Czechoslovakia. Mrs Milman, née Büchler, lived together with Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s two brothers and both her brothers's parents in both her brothers's town of birth, where Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s father owned and ran a big and flourishing butcher shop (which included a kosher and non-kosher department). Whilst Mrs Milman, née Büchler, attended the Buergerschule in Puchow in Czechoslovakia, Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s older brothers attended the nearby Gymnasium in Trenein. After the Nazi occupation in 1939, Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s two brothers had to leave high school and Mrs Milman, née Büchler, had to leave Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s school. Whilst Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s older brother, Ferdninand, hence forth worked in Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s father’s shop and Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s other brother Otto trained as an electrician in Trenein, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, attended the newly founded Jewish school in Puchov, which had around 30 – 40 Jewish children, who were taught in three different classes. The prosecuting measures from the Nazis that soon began, put Mrs Milman, née Büchler, in great fear and anxiety; since Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s father was wealthy, her father was wrongly imprisoned several times and subjected to blackmail after confronting witnesses who made false accusations when her father was once in prison for 3 weeks. But, since her father denied the false testimony, the attempted blackmail was at first in vain. As Slovakia was affiliated with Nazi Germany, the Slovakian police carried out nightly searches, whereby valuables such as; silver, furs, radios etc. were confiscated without compensation. At the beginning of 1941, the butchers, which Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s father owned was taken under provisional administration and then aryanised. Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s father started working in another shop and obtained the normal wage of a journeyman; however, a journeyman's assets and property were seized. As the first extermination transport in March 1942 from Czechslovakia departed, Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s brother, Ferdinand was sent to the collection depot in Zilina. One week later Livia’s brother, Ferdinand was deported; no-one heard from Livia’s brother, Ferdinand again. In April 1942 Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s other brother was brought into the spotlight. Livia’s other brother's mother tried to see Livia’s other brother one more time, as Livia’s other brother was deported from Trenein. His mother did see Livia’s other brother for the last time, just as the transportation passed through the station in Puchov; thereafter, again, nothing was heard from Otto. - 2 - From that time on, the deportations were implemented in a systematic sequence: 1) Male Jews from the ages of 16 to 40 years old, 2) Female Jews of the same age, 3) Married Jewish couples with no children, 4) Married Jewish couples with children. Only labour vital for Slovakia, who received yellow identity papers were exempt from deportation. When such identity papers were issued, such identity papers were delivered by post. Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s uncle, the lawyer, Dr. Emanuel Denes in Pressburg had attained Identity papers for Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov. This was of great importance, as on the following day a transport for exterminating Jewish married couples with children, who did not possess identity papers was compiled. Since the successor of the Aryanised butchers – a Slovakian married couple – who were interested in preventing the timely delivery of Identity papers to Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov, the Slovakian authorities in Trenein held back Identity papers and let Identity papers go back to Trenein. Notified by Dr. Denes, Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov knew Identity papers was in the county town Trencin and due to the transportation made a final, important appeal to Dr. Denes, urging the delivery of Identity papers within three days, as Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov were still spending time in the detention camp for the final deportation. As Dr. Denes got Identity papers on the 7th June 1944 for Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov, it was already too late, Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov had already been transported from the detention camp in Puchov and Dr. Denes found out through “Ayrian” contacts that Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov was forced through ill-treatment to disclose which “Aryan” friends Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov had deposited cash contributions. As. Dr. Denes, Mr. and Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov met at the last minute in front of Mr. and Mrs. Büchler's removal transport to Puchov on the platform, Mr. and Mrs. Büchler expressed Mr. and Mrs. Büchler's last wish for Dr. Denes to hide Mrs Milman, née Büchler, and to deal with the matter of identity papers. Mrs Milman, née Büchler, then found Mrs Milman, née Büchler, not with Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s parents: Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov had in the expectation of doom sent Mrs Milman, née Büchler, on 4th June 1944 to Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s sister’s, Mrs. Bertha Wohlstein in Dolne, Wasardice near Hlohovec. This aunt of Mrs Milman, née Büchler, was married, but did not have any children. Mrs Milman, née Büchler, and Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s husband cultivated a country estate, whose principal owner was Dr. Denes, who was the brother of Mrs. Büchlers and Mrs. Wohlsteins. Mr. and Mrs. Wohlsteins, as well as, Dr. Denes possessed identity papers; Dr. Denes was however a lawyer under occupational ban. As the Slovakian authority – in front of the removal transport to Puchov – searched for Mrs Milman, née Büchler,, Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s parents explained that both her brothers did not know where Mrs Milman, née Büchler, was and then Mrs Milman, née Büchler, ran away. Mrs. Wohlsteins hid Mrs Milman, née Büchler, for the next three days in an attic. - 3 - Food was given to Mrs Milman, née Büchler, through a roof hatch. On behalf of the police, Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov searched for Mrs Milman, née Büchler,, but the police could not find Mrs Milman, née Büchler,. Dr. Denes hid Mrs Milman, née Büchler, for ten days at sympathetic friends in Piestany. Dr. Denes then brought Mrs Milman, née Büchler, back and hid Mrs Milman, née Büchler, in a back room. Eventually and probably through betrayal, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, was found by Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov. Whilst Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s Aunty, Mrs. Wohlsteins bombarded Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov with pleas and gave Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov money, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, ran away and hid in the woods nearby. Dr. Denes found Mrs Milman, née Büchler, at night and took Mrs Milman, née Büchler, back to the people in Piestany, who could no longer keep Mrs Milman, née Büchler,, which is why, Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s Uncle, Dr. Denes took Mrs Milman, née Büchler, to be accommodated by Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov in the area of Nitra. This was ensured by the daily receipt of money; as Mrs Milman, née Büchler, was unable of paying Mrs Milman, née Büchler,, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, could withdraw money from another source, where Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s father amongst others had deposited money. Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov was the wife of an “Aryan”-Slovakian policeman, who was transferred to Trenein and new nothing of the whole thing. Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov referred Mrs Milman, née Büchler, to a protestant boarding school in Modra by Trenein, in which school-age, baptised Jewish girls were able to still be christened. When someone came to visit Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, immediately hid under the bed and when Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov left in the evenings, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, sat still in the dark. One time, Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov spoke to Mrs Milman, née Büchler, about a wicked man, who was also incidentally called Chlapik, who took money from the Jews. Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov also revealed that Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov steals the confidence of young Jewish girls, in the guise of protecting them, who are then subsequently raped. After eight days, Dr. Denes fetched for Mrs Milman, née Büchler, from Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov with a taxi, of which Dr. Denes knew and trusted the chauffeur. During the drive, Dr. Denes proposed to Dr. Denes's niece, to accept the position as a maid on the basis of “Aryan” identity papers, for which a certain Mr. Chlaplik would provide the money for. Thereupon, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, reported in a whisper what Mrs Milman, née Büchler, had learnt about a certain Mr. Chlaplik from a certain Mr. Chlaplik's wife. Dr. Denes, which at first brought Mrs Milman, née Büchler, to the Wohlsteins, kept the revelations about a certain Mr. Chlaplik as Dr. Denes considered the revelations about Chlaplik unbelievable and gave a certain Mr. Chlaplik praise. But, Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov was completely against Dr. Denes suggestion and as a certain Mr. Chlaplik came, Livia’s parents – the married couple Büchler, which arrived on the 4th June 1944 in Puchov told Dr. Denes that Livia, who they had hid in their house has had an accident and is being treated in hospital in Nitra. From the Wohlsteins Mrs Milman, née Büchler, set out to an evangelical Pastor in Deges, recommended by Mrs Milman, née Büchler, and was baptised. It was arranged that Dr. Denes should attempt to contact the evangelical boarding school in Modra. - 4 - an evangelical Pastor in Deges, recommended by Mrs. Chlaplik, the wife of the policeman did not have any success, which Mrs Milman, née Büchler, did not know about, as Mrs Milman, née Büchler, sneaked to Modra and turned to the pastor Derer, who presented Mrs Milman, née Büchler, with Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s certification of baptism. an evangelical Pastor in Deges, recommended by Mrs. Chlaplik, the wife of the policeman told Mrs Milman, née Büchler, that an evangelical Pastor in Deges, recommended by Mrs. Chlaplik, the wife of the policeman could not take Mrs Milman, née Büchler, in the evangelical boarding school in Modra, as there was no more space in the dormitory. Henceforth, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, went to the headmistress of the evangelical boarding school in Modra, Maria Sobinova, a Slovakian, who – it was in August 1942 – took Mrs Milman, née Büchler, in the evangelical boarding school in Modra. Mrs Milman, née Büchler, attended the evangelical boarding school in Modra until June 1944, furthermore, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, obtained a place for Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s younger cousin Eva Denes, who had also been baptised. As the headmistress of the boarding school, Maria Sobinova, a Slovakian, who – it was in August 1942 – took Livia in the school was fond of Mrs Milman, née Büchler,, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, took Mrs Milman, née Büchler, in June 1944 into Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s own home. As the headmistress of the boarding school, Maria Sobinova, a Slovakian, who – it was in August 1942 – took Livia in the school in June 1944 was on a trip, the SD surrounded the evangelical boarding school in Modra, as the attendance of 16 baptised Jewish girls had been given away. As her younger cousin Eva Denes, who had also been baptised had prewarned Mrs Milman, née Büchler, in a timely manner, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, hid in the house of the evangelical boarding school in Modra's headmistress, as Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s husband, an engineer lay by chance in bed ill. the SD limited the SD, in asking him, a respectable man, through a window, if the SD had hidden any Jews, which the SD chose to deny in order to save Mrs Milman, née Büchler,. The other girls in the evangelical boarding school in Modra tried as best The other girls in the boarding school could to hide. For example, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, hid in the vineyard. However, only four succeeded in escaping, the other twelve – among the other twelve – among them Eva Denes Mrs Milman, née Büchler, – were the next morning abducted by the SD, which the headmistress of the boarding school, Maria Sobinova, a Slovakian, who – it was in August 1942 – took Livia in the school threatened to shoot dead. the headmistress of the boarding school, Maria Sobinova, a Slovakian, who – it was in August 1942 – took Livia in the school, explained that Mrs Milman, née Büchler, must immediately flee. Mrs Milman, née Büchler, travelled at night to Trenein, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, arrived at 4am. Mrs Milman, née Büchler, searched immediately for Eva Denes mother, who lived in hiding, after Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s husband, the lawyer Dr. Denes was deported. On Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s advice and at the risk of Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s own life, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, searched for Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s daughter to save Mrs Milman, née Büchler, at the last minute, in which Mrs Milman, née Büchler, begged the evangelical priest Derer in Modra to take action in favour of Mrs Milman, née Büchler,. However, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, came 5 minutes too late and in total despair Mrs Milman, née Büchler, handed Mrs Milman, née Büchler, to the Nazis. Mrs Milman, née Büchler, took false “Aryanian” identity papers, which Mrs Milman, née Büchler, bought just in case, a position as a maid in Trenein. This position, which Mrs Milman, née Büchler, had obtained from a newspaper advertisemen, was however for Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s incompatible, because Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s landlord used to come home drunk and - 5 - her landlord's harassment in turn was to be feared. Therefore, from a recommendation from another cousin, Livia Salzer, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, took another position as a maid in Piestany, which Mrs Milman, née Büchler, occupied until November 1944. Once again, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, was then betrayed. However, another cousin, Livia Salzer could warn Mrs Milman, née Büchler, in real time and thus, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, left Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s position in Piestany immediately and together with Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s cousin, Livia Salzer, both Livia Büchler and Livia Salzer fled to a woods 30km away from Piestany, where approximately 60 Jews from neighbouring Slovakian farms hid for money and were housed. In case of emergency both Livia Büchler and Livia Salzer had prepared in a nearby forest a bunker, in which both Livia Büchler and Livia Salzer spent the last remaining months of the war, which contributed to both Livia Büchler and Livia Salzer's safety that the Slovakian partisans conducted the Slovakian partisans in a sympathetic manner. In the middle of this group of Jewish refugees both Mrs Milman, née Büchler, and Mrs Milman, née Büchler, survived. After the liberation, Mrs Milman, née Büchler, attended the commercial academy in Bratislava until the end of Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s examinations. Afterwards through the Australian Jewish Welfare Society Mrs Milman, née Büchler, obtained the entry permit for Australia, on the boat ride Mrs Milman, née Büchler, got to know Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s future husband, Mr. Peysach Milman, who Mrs Milman, née Büchler, her marriage in May 1950 in Melbourne, where Mrs Milman, née Büchler, and Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s husband still now reside. For Mrs Milman, née Büchler,'s marriage Mrs Milman, née Büchler, reconverted to Judaism.

Experiences during the years 1938-1945 Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was born in Vienna in 1927. Before Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 describe Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's own experiences of the Hitler era, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 want to briefly state what happened to Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's family. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's parents left Vienna in 1940 and passed through Bratislava, where My parents had to stay for a long time; then through Rumania towards Palestine. From here, My parents were supposed to be shipped to Mauritius on the ‘Patria’, whose ignominious end is well-known. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's parents were able to save My parents's lives and were interned in Atlith. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's mother, then suffering particularly badly, was discharged after 8 weeks and died in June 1941 in Tel Aviv. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's father, after a six month internment, went into a Kibbuz with Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's two sisters. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's sisters had already emigrated from Vienna in 1938 with the Youth Alijah. Another sister came in this way to Palestine from Holland in March 1940, where Another sister had been on Hachscharah in Loosdrecht. Another sister, as well as Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's younger sister, left Vienna with Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 lived with me and my sisters's uncle L.Ph.Polak in Amsterdam until autumn 1943, when the protective ‘barriers’ were lifted. Then, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 moved in under the name Landweer with a Dutch Gardener in a suburb of Amsterdam. Edit, then 14 years old, was blonde and looked Aryan, so that Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 trusted Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 being on the streets and distributed flyers for the resistance on a bicycle. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 visited the hiding place of me and my sisters's only living uncle in Amsterdam, together with our only living uncle's wife. These three survived the Hitler era. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 came from a devout Jewish household. Against Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's Zionist upbringing, religion took a back seat. Aged 10, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 became a pupil of the Chajes Grammar School and learnt Hebrew as a child. Soon after the Nazi invasion in Vienna, the Chajes Grammar School was closed. In autumn 1938, a Jewish middle school was opened in the second district in Schiffamt Street, where Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 attended for a further month. Attendance was irregular. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's mother tried to get me and my sisters children out of Germany as soon as possible. Until the 10th of November 1938, me and my sisters lived in the third district in Goethehof, where one sister had already emigrated. On the 10th of November 1938, me and my sisters were evicted and arrested. me and my sisters were taken, along with all the Jews in the area, about forty to fifty families, into a cellar, which was cordoned-off. On the morning of the 10th of November 1938, all the men from around 18 years upwards, were collected by Police Officers in panda cars and transported to Hahn Street to the police barracks, where all the men from around 18 years upwards remained a few days. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's father was released as an injured serviceman from the First World War. On a headcount in the police barracks, where they remained a few days, about one in every ten were released, whilst those remaining were sent to a concentration camp. Those women detained in a cellar, which was cordoned-off were taken to clean the streets, where Those women detained in the cellar were maltreated by the population. On one occasion, me and my sisters were given soup. On the afternoon of the 11th, women with several children were released. me and my sisters's apartment in Goethehof, where one sister had already emigrated was destroyed and looted, yet me and my sisters still found some serviceable furniture and clothes. me and my sisters were allowed to take women with several children with me and my sisters. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's mother found an abandoned Jewish house, whose owner had fled to Holland. Somehow, My mother succeeded in moving in here. It was not permitted to hire a car; Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's mother procured a carriage and, with the rest of me and my sisters's possessions, me and my sisters moved into the house in Schiffamt Street. Every day, me and my sisters travelled into town to the Israeli Cultural Community, where the Kindertransport was being organised. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's mother finally got Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 and Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's sisters onto the Dutch list. On the 12th December 1938, a special train left the Vienna Western Railway Station with about 800 children between the ages of around 12 and 15 accompanied by some Jewish and Christian women from Holland. about 800 children between the ages of around 12 and 15 accompanied by some Jewish and Christian women from Holland had as much baggage as about 800 children between the ages of around 12 and 15 accompanied by some Jewish and Christian women from Holland were allowed to carry and had also brought food for the journey…, otherwise, there would have been no food. about 800 children between the ages of around 12 and 15 accompanied by some Jewish and Christian women from Holland were grouped according to list and travelled on group passports. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 took the farewell as being forever, from now on Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 felt degraded, to a point, humiliated. the journey passed through Vienna, Frankfurt, Cologne and Bentheim to The Hague and lasted for 24 hours. Children, who were supposed to go to Holland, some of the wagons were directed to the Hook of Holland. The sight of the small towns and villages during the journey seemed to Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 like pictures from a schoolbook. Everything looked so small and peaceful. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 imagined that behind the front doors of all the houses, strange things were happening. At the border, me and my sisters were met by the Dutch Red Cross and were overwhelmed with food and chocolate. Even here, the feeling set in that me and my sisters would never be let go, would always be given something, as well as always having to say ‘Thank you!’ The strange place was like a depression to Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938, which was no longer being at home. In The Hague, the Dutch Committee of Refugees took over responsibility for me and my sisters. the Dutch Committee of Refugees's Director (a Catholic) was Frau Boon, the second Director (a Jew) Frau van Raalte. me and my sisters were taken to Schiffamt Street into a school, bathed and disinfected. me and my sisters was given blue training suits and blue baseball caps. During this period of quarantine, me and my sisters had a really good and fun life. Over several weeks, visits and outings were not possible, as, me and my sisters had nothing to do and in some cases had measles and mumps appeared…, yet, me and my sisters were allowed to go out and play in the school yard. Even though forbidden, Dutch children came to the fence and brought presents, until this was stopped by the sisters, who shooed-away about 800 children between the ages of around 12 and 15 accompanied by some Jewish and Christian women from Holland…., me and my sisters's nurses were in every respect more preferable. After the raising of the quarantine, about 800 children between the ages of around 12 and 15 accompanied by some Jewish and Christian women from Holland were divided between the castles of The Hague and Overvoorde in The Hague. It was, by now, March 1939. The distribution centred mainly around whether there were individual children, or brothers and sisters. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was taken to Ockenburgh, which, after the Nazi invasion in Vienna, was used as a provisional airfield. It is worth mentioning here that some half-Jewish children were amongst me and my sisters, and Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 recollect, that over the course of the year at least two were returned to Vienna. In The Hague, me and my sisters met children from Berlin, who me and my sisters got into arguments with, but who proved to be harmless in the end. me and my sisters's homes were found by the Dutch Committee of Refugees. The managerial staff of The Hague had a Matron, the Teacher, Nurses and Sisters, who took a lesser role. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 would like to mention the Teacher and Nurse Frau Henny Batiste, who worked there out of idealism and looked after me and my sisters's mental wellbeing like a mother and old friend. If someone had ever ‘done something’, so the Teacher and Nurse Frau Henny Batiste, who worked there out of idealism and looked after our mental wellbeing like a mother and old friend would always intervene on our behalf with the management, where things were not easy for the Teacher and Nurse Frau Henny Batiste, who worked there out of idealism and looked after our mental wellbeing like a mother and old friend, as the Teacher and Nurse Frau Henny Batiste, who worked there out of idealism and looked after our mental wellbeing like a mother and old friend and the Teacher and Nurse Frau Henny Batiste, who worked there out of idealism and looked after our mental wellbeing like a mother and old friend's husband were Anarchists. During the First World War, both did a great deal in particular for Jewish children. Here is a summary of me and my sisters's day: At 7 o’clock me and my sisters were woken, followed by washing, making me and my sisters's beds and breakfast.., then the usual gardening. School was not held. Lunch was served in two groups. The afternoons’ me and my sisters had free. me and my sisters were, however, grouped according to me and my sisters's interests. me and my sisters quickly learned Hebrew. The little children were brought up in a nursery. Most of me and my sisters were intellectually early developers and displayed barely any considerable mental disturbances. me and my sisters had a reading and amateur dramatic circle; a football club etc and did everything, basically, like in a holiday camp. The great daily surprise was the giving out of the post. me and my sisters went to sleep according to me and my sisters's age at 7, 8 or 9 o’clock…., the eldest children at 10 o’clock. It was possible to visit the synagogue in The Hague and afterwards children of Jewish families were invited for dinner. Apart from that, there was no religious education, whilst Zionist groups formed. Jews living in The Hague took one or more of me and my sisters's children in with Jews living in The Hague, who visited our children at the weekend or lived with our children. Some baptised children, who seemed in special need of protection, were taken in as outside elements. In summer 1939, legal provisions for going out were lightened and me and my sisters were allowed to go to The Hague accompanied by adults. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 visited some of me and my sisters's youth leaders at home and went to Batiste’s house and to Batiste’s's parents’, as well as a family called Blok. It was about August 1939, that the Ockenburgh and Overvoorde homes were moved together into a large elegant landed property with a huge garden and park bearing the name ‘Huis ten Vijver’ in Scheveningen, Dwarsweg. Many of the children now went to separate Jewish families; the elder children found employment as Maids or Nannies. me and my sisters were already familiar with Holland and were also allowed to attend school in September. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 attended a middle school in Scheveningen, Dwarsweg. The home was slowly dissolved; the elder boys went, were the elder boys to want to, to Hachscharah. Many of the children had to wait patiently until Many of the children were taken in by a family privately. Were separate children or a few collected together in a car, then me and my sisters knew that separate children had been ‘picked-up’ by rich people. Were separate children to be collected in Frau Boon's car, then separate children were going to families who did not own a car of families who did not own a car of their own's own. During this time, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 continued to receive post from Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's parents in Vienna. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 later learnt that Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was in Vienna and knew that Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's mother had undergone surgery for cancer in the General Hospital. As Holland's declaration of war became known, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was in the street. In supplements to the Dutch trade journal ‘Algemene Handelsblad’, it was possible to follow the German invasion of Holland on larger maps. In November, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 believe the German invasion of Poland was the second; Frau Boon collected Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 in Frau Boon's car and took Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 to Bussum to the V.S family, which comprised the widow V.S, a fifty year old, three daughters and two sons. The eldest son lived on a farm in Deventer in individual Hachscharah. Frau Boon was actively involved in the Zionist life of The Hague, but this Zionism served as a substitute for religion and the V.S family, which comprised the widow V.S, a fifty year old, three daughters and two sons was, basically, liberal with countless others in the country, where people considered people first and foremost Dutch. Like so many others, Frau Boon considered Frau Boon morally obliged to take in a child refugee. Frau Boon's house was furnished in a modern style and the V.S family, which comprised the widow V.S, a fifty year old, three daughters and two sons was very musical. the V.S family, which comprised the widow V.S, a fifty year old, three daughters and two sons lived off of the not too inconsiderable inherited savings of Frau Boon's husband, which was comprised of interest from shares and the donations of wealthy relatives, of which there were many. Although they were all very kind to Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 never felt much at home there. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was sensitive of the fact that Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's keep was only out of a sense of moral duty. In addition was the circumstance that Frau Boon did not know how to behave towards Frau Boon's own children. Frau Boon was so consumed by Frau Boon's own good deeds that Frau Boon neglected her own relationship, who did not wish to remain with Frau Boon and arranged for Frau Boon's financial assistance, because they did not wish to play into the hands of Frau Boon's own financial stupidity. Along with Esther, who was the same age as Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 attended a Montessori sixth-form college. one sister, worked in an office in Amsterdam.., just like the 18 year old Jaap, with whom Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 shared a room. Hannah, the youngest, was a schoolgirl, three years younger than Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938. Frau Boon was a dedicated Secretary of the Dutch Committee of Refugees and undertook primarily administrative work and also worked for the choir in the Bach parish. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 could not really settle here and did not want to go to sleep at the same time as her own children, for example, because her own children were considered ‘children’, was, as stubborn, annoyed Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938. At thirteen, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 considered Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 a more mature and experienced young man. Frau Boon, in particular, had it in for Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938. On the 10th May 1940, war broke out with Germany. We sat, as usual, having breakfast at 8.30 in the morning and listened to the morning music on the radio, which was interrupted by the news of the invasion of German troops. As we all sat there speechless and numbed, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 screamed hysterically “We must go! Quickly! Quickly! Pack our things and try to get to Ijmuiden. It’s still quite possible to escape to Holland. Quickly! Quickly! Any minute now could make it too late!” Frau Boon brushed off Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's calls and said “It’s not going to be possible as Frau Boon see it. You cannot escape without a visa and what should we do with the house and furniture?” Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was terribly excited and the V.S family, which comprised the widow V.S, a fifty year old, three daughters and two sons treated Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 like someone who’d lost the V.S family, which comprised the widow V.S, a fifty year old, three daughters and two sons's mind. In any case, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was not allowed to go to school and was supposed to stay at home. On the 10th of November 1938, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's nerves had reached my nerves's absolute limit and Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 expressed Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's emotions for the last time. After the 10th of November 1938, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was silent and spoke almost not a word. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was treated rather as though Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was insane than as a child…., yet they were quite aware of the fact and had been warned what ‘the Germans’ meant and that we should quickly get up and away. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 maintained this stance throughout the First World War. this stance was a stance of the upmost doggedness, 100% trust in saving Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 and the certainty that Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 could rely upon no-one else. It would have been Frau Boon's duty to do all in Frau Boon's power to flee to Holland (Frau Boon's sister’s family in The Hague had, like dozens of other families done the same on the same day. her sister’s family in Aerdenhout saved her sister’s family in Aerdenhout and now reside in Germany). In 1944, Frau Boon lost Frau Boon's son, who was captured and deported by German troops and who is dead. Now, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 only had Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 to turn to. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was interested in Hebrew and Geography…, otherwise, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 had little interest in school. Yet, knowledge of English and Geography was later to be of benefit to Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938. There was fighting for four days on end. The weather was glorious and we saw hundreds of white parachutes, which fell from the blue sky. On the 14th May, Holland surrendered. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 went to the main road from Amsterdam to Amsterdam and saw the military lorries with German troops in steel helmets. German troops marching by sang German military songs. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 had a strange feeling that Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938’d encountered something strangely familiar once more. A danger, admittedly! Yet, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was aware of this! The role of spectator later became a characteristic symbol. During the whole time Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was ‘in hiding’, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 played The role of spectator in various disguises. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's isolation from other Jews, the Dutch ones, who did not trust other Jews, the Dutch ones, who did not trust themselves to escape without a visa to escape without a visa, was actually Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's salvation. Evoked through a lack of understanding, this isolation had always constantly moved Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 to act differently than the ‘older and cleverer ones’ were required to and it is to this that Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 have to thank Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's life. In autumn 1940, Jewish children were excluded from all schools. Ration cards were introduced; Frau Boon bought provisions…., Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 remember chocolate and biscuits. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's relationship with the V.S family, which comprised the widow V.S, a fifty year old, three daughters and two sons had, in the meantime, totally broken down…, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was unaware of the fact as to whether the V.S family, which comprised the widow V.S, a fifty year old, three daughters and two sons wanted Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 to commit suicide and to go with Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938. Frau Boon was no longer able to take it and had more concerns than Frau Boon could deal with under normal circumstances. Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938's foster mother was friends with Frau Wolf in Bussum, who had something to do with the Dutch Committee of Refugees. It was in this way that Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 left the Frau Boon house in Bussum in November 1940 and was put up in Hilversum. Here, Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was placed with a poor Jewish family, who had several child refugees in the house and were paid by the Dutch Committee of Refugees. The Haan family, as a poor Jewish family, who had several child refugees in the house and were paid by the Committee were called, actually lived in a boarding house, which Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was soon to experience personally. Four boys slept to a room…., Heinz Landwirth, formerly from Vienna, who came with a children's transport to Holland in December 1938 was the eldest! The food was bad…, one warm meal daily, mostly stew and two loaves of bread, from which Four boys had 3 or 4 slices with margarine, jam and peanut butter. It wasn’t wonderful, as the rations were scarce and The Haan family, as they were called also had to live from The H",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
, etc. all in all, I witnessed a very interesting, historically important time. All the employees had different names, after weeks - 10 - the Gestapo knew the name, then it was changed again. We knew about secret loads of ammunition, etc. at all times, what good Dutch people did at the risk of their own lives, is unique in history. Friesland most notably stood out. The difficulties increased - hunger in the West - us alone the weekly food, lucky enough not to suffer from hunger. No light, no gas, no fuel, etc. We didn’t suffer from cold, however, thousands of people did. The stricter the measures, the more resentful the people, everything German, was hated. In December the raids on men up to 45 years increased steadily, also Leo was a victim of such a raid in Garyp. Hilde called in a state of agitation - in the meanwhile, the men had already been taken to huis van bewaring (prison, W.L.) (before felon) to Leeuwarden. Sierk arranged for the forged identity card that proves that this man is free for the work deployment in Germany, Hilde went to the Gestapo by herself, didn’t succeed alone, with the help of a lawyer Leo was released after 10 anxious days - he continued to live under this impression for weeks. They must have known who they released ! So there was one turmoil after the next. Friesland was jam-packed with evacuees, the Germans occupied all our peaceful villages, commandeered schools and homes within a few hours. Meanwhile, Leo obtained a decent position - he was Rijkscontrolleur for evacuees for two municipalities, Tijdjerksterdeel and Dautuma-deel, the latter municipality is where I lived and so Leo came over often. He acquitted himself excellently, one must have a strong social sense for such a position, work that suits him - after the liberation the office in Leeuwarden was in for a surprise when Dekker turned out to be Marcus. There were many nice things during this difficult time as well, I can go on for evenings. From Dec. I was also registered as evacuee and then I received fl. 5.50 of allowance monthly, my only income in all those years ! Many people fled from the hunger to the North, we also had such hunger evacuees in the house. Then the March offensive came with the achievements you are familiar with. Radio reports were becoming less, the few people who still secretly owned a radio, were without power, and who still had power “clandestin” (secretly, W.L.), hardly heard anything anymore as power was available mostly for the Germans for a few hours during the night. However, good reports get through to you. In September we had finished the flags and Oranje-rosettes etc. and all, now we knew, that we could wear them soon. On the 11th April a troop of young German soldiers was sworn in close to where we lived, shouting “Heil Hitler” and “Fuehrer wir folgen dir” (“Fuehrer we follow you”), singing the national anthem, this spectacle was then settled once and for all - it has taken long enough anyway. You should have seen the withdrawal of the Germans, Emil 1918 was a parade compared to that. All farmers had to deliver their carts and horses - 11 - and had to go with them - it was a “tragedy”, that I really liked. On 12th April in the morning, when we got up, we were liberated from the Nazi pest, which means they had left our villages. The Versetzlager, called N.B.S., took action immediately. The Arrests of the N.S.B.ers began and so many rumours about the Canadians coming were spread - all employees were working intensely, details on that later - the great miracle happened - the Canadians were supposed to drive with their tanks at 7 o’clock through ..... woude. I will never forget that moment - it was so powerful and marvellous, the people were so excited, that they didn’t know what to do. On one of the first tanks that drove towards Dokkum, sat Mijnheer Humalta from Dokkum. Also, several other employees in Canadian uniform passed our house calling out to us “het leve de undergrondse” It was great. In the following days Germans were still in battle with N.B.S. with Canadians in our area. This caused some of our good boys being killed in action. N.B.S. means “Nederlandse binnenlandse strijdkrachten” (Netherlands Forces of the Interior, W.L.) The boys had all been wearing a helmet and a pair of blue overalls, what do you call that in German, blue dungarees, I cannot really tell what the right term is. Now we were free ! Everything decorated with flags, the people in full joy - but a heavy burden lay on all of us - the poor hungry West. For another couple of weeks they had been living under the tyranny of the occupying forces and were starving. Until finally, on the 5th May, with the surrender also that misery came to an end. Each municipality had their military staff and Sierk was with them, we practically didn’t see him in the first couple of days, until, overtired as he was, had to cease work for a few days. What entered as spoils - we were starving, the Moffen (offensive word for Germans, W.L.), indeed, did not. Then we made plans for going home - Zwolle had also been released on the 14th April. Leo went to Zwolle by bike on Wednesday and undertook the first measures. Finally, we had an open truck on 27th April, with 3 children and Bagage we bade all our dear friends farewell on a Friday noon - so the most important era of our life was over. Leo made them put “Joden- vervoer” (Judenfahrt, W.L.) on the travel permit, that way we got through all checks. Before directly after our liberation “Bueros voor Onderduikers” (offices for hiding persons, W.L.) were opened and suddenly, we were normal people again. It takes a long time to orient yourself in normal life, which is not normal either after a war, of course. The sad things we got to hear about all our fellow Jews, it is too much to assimilate and digest them all. - We, who miraculously pulled through this time, have every Reden (reason, W.L.) to thank God and all decent Dutch people who kept us alive by helping us - 12 - from the bottom of our hearts - I will never forget that. Now we want to try to use our strength for where our help is needed in order to rebuild our country - everything is still in chaos and disorder - God grant that we will succeed and that we will serve for the benefit of the country! Amen. Emil, if it doesn’t bother you to make a few carbon copies for Else, Ernst, maybe Marta and Julius, I would be very thankful. Lots of love and kisses yours Selma When reading through I noticed that I sometimes expressed myself a little bit “Dutch”," which you will surely excuse.

60,"[""A personal report on the author's arrest in Vienna together with many thousands of other Jews, their sufferings in the different improvised Sammellager (p.2-4) through the brutalities of the SS (p.1-5), the obliging behaviour of the Viennese police (p.1), and how the guards shared the guards's bread with the guards (p.2). the author's was sent on a transport of seventy prisoners to Dachau (p.5-7), where the worst part proved to be the roll-call in the rain and cold, twice a day. Soon, the severe frost caused chill-blains and frozen and swollen limbs, and the lack of treatment - there were four Sanitätsgehilfen at the disposal of 200-300 patients - led to serious illness and death (p.6). the author's was released after sixty days of internment. 9. Further References : Attrocities. Israelitische Kultusgemeinde, Vienna (p.3). Torture, murder, suicides, blackmail (p.3,4). 10. Remarks : A sketch of the Dachau camp is attached to the report. Arrested in Vienna and sent to Dachau On Thursday, 10 November 1938, in the early morning I was arrested in the street by a policeman and taken to the nearest police station ‘in order to give some information’. I was fully aware what that meant, for apart from the fact that we still remembered with horror the arrests during May and June, which had been introduced in just the same way, the few days before 10 November had been filled with tension and fearful expectations: how would the Government react after the Paris incident[1]? And the artificially excited and stirred up Volksstimme[2] made us fear the worst. In the guardroom I had to wait for quite some time, other people who had been taken there were already sitting there, and then we were escorted to the nearest police station. Several hundred people were already assembled in the courtyard of the nearest police station – it was about 11 am – and here it was our last opportunity to see our relatives, for I want to point out that the Vienna police were extremely obliging, the Viennese police even showed that the Viennese police disapproved of this whole business, which was to have some special consequences later. So we received many a gift from our relatives and could give our relatives some important information. For we had exchanged among ourselves our various experiences: one had been fetched from his shop, another one from his home, a third from some office or even from a train that was already ready for leaving for abroad. Also, when their houses were searched, under the pretence of looking for hidden weapons, in reality all the valuables in their homes, such as jewellery, money, silver cutlery, cameras, typewriters etc had been confiscated. So in case it was not too late we were able to warn the women about these actions. It was our last conversation for a long time. At the nearest police station new prisoners kept continuously arriving; this lasted until about 4pm and stopped only at about 4pm. We supposed that that was the end of the action, which later did turn out to be correct. For all those who had not yet been taken to the nearest police station at that time or who had been arrested later were released soon after. We however were standing in the courtyard of the nearest police station, waiting for what would happen. It was already 11pm, we had been standing there for 12 hours, and some of us had been fetched for an interrogation and then suddenly at midnight an SS special forces troop (field-grey military uniforms with steel helmets) came into the nearest police station, short orders were to be heard and then we were prepared to be transported. We were sorted into various sections with our faces turned to the wall, while we were being pushed around and screamed at and we were driven away in buses. Getting onto buses was the first nice - 2 - opportunity for these thugs to have fun because when these thugs thought people were too slow these thugs immediately beat people with riding whips and leather belts. Unfortunately it was mainly the old and sick who were hit, and these were also in the time to follow among the main targets of their sadistic excesses. We arrived at the IX Wiener Gemeindebezirk[3]; we thought the central Vienna police prison on the Elisabethpromenade would be our destination, but we were driven on to Pramergasse, Vienna IX, to the police riding school. When we got off they played the same jolly game again that we had already gone through when we got onto the bus. We came into a huge complex [of buildings] and saw whole companies of Jews, already lined up in rank and file, from other Vienna districts. Never before had we seen such a lot of Jews together in one place. We estimated that there were about 4,000 men, and there was also just the same number on the Elisabethpromenade, in the Sophiensälen (a huge Viennese place of entertainment) and even more in the Karajangasse (a school in the XX Vienna district, turned into a provisional prison) and there were also those from the nearby province (Baden, Mödling etc.) who had been taken to Vienna and were now crowded together in the former district law-court in Vienna IX, altogether a gigantic mass. We were lined up in rank and file and were standing there under guard half the night from Thursday to Friday, 11 November, and the whole of Friday without being allowed to move even one step from the row, let alone get anything to eat. Towards the evening the strict rules were relaxed, we could go to the toilet, could buy a bread roll from a baker who had appeared and were allowed to lie on the floor to get some sleep. Considering the fact that the floor consisted of ground bark mixed with horse dung and similar ingredients and yet we threw ourselves onto the floor as if by command just to get some rest, you can imagine how exhausted Several hundred people were who had been on Several hundred people's feet for 36 hours. Of course there were rumours upon rumours. One person said One person had got some ‘authentic’ news from a policeman, another one claimed another one had got some true information from a policeman; one said we would be released as early as in two days, another was already talking about Dachau for the first time, which we could not believe since we were innocent – we regarded him as a pessimist. Oh how right were those who had foreseen the worst. As to food, there had still been no sign of it – apart from the one bread roll – until Saturday morning, 12 November. And it was just that which made the optimists not give up hope because we had already been in custody for 48 hours. At last Several hundred people stirred, one could see bread being distributed, but far too little for the masses and that caused a hustle and bustle like in a wild animal cage at feeding time. Later it turned out that the Viennese guards had no longer been able to stand this inhuman treatment and had shared the Viennese guards's own food with us. And even later there was another distribution of bread which was organised for those who had not had anything so far. another distribution of bread which was organised for those who had not had anything so far had been initiated by the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien[4]. It is not easy to imagine the general feelings among Several hundred people; Several hundred people were exhausted, hungry, constantly expecting nothing but the worst. And yet surprisingly the atmosphere was rather peaceful although hysterical fits and those of epileptics were nothing out of the ordinary and threatened to cause the outbreak of a collective hysteria. At last there was an end to this situation on Saturday evening when the transports began. We were loaded onto open military cars at the end of which two SS men were sitting with fixed bayonets and we were urgently warned that anybody trying to flee would be shot. We passed the Ringstraße, the Burgstraße and then into the Kenyonstraße, Vienna IX, where we were taken into a former convent school. When we got out of open military cars at the end of which two SS men were sitting with fixed bayonets there was screaming, lashing, queuing in the corridor with our faces turned to the wall, then the order: up onto the fourth floor. There a small room, probably once the bedroom of a nun, now completely empty. Apart from a hysterical fit of one of our comrades the night was quiet, but of course on a hard floor. The next day, Sunday, 13 November, various inspections took place. It still seemed as if the gentlemen were not sure what to do with us. We had some premonition when we saw people who had been seen to by SA men in the police station Wien II, Ausstellungsstraße (according to various reports which agreed with one another the police station Wien II, Ausstellungsstraße was the most horrible place to be taken to on 10 November in Vienna IX). Bloody heads, temporary dressings, black eyes etc. were terrible evidence of that treatment. In the night from Thursday to Monday, 14 November, a sudden inspection, everybody jumps up, still drowsy, the ‘Zimmerkommandant’[5] reports: ‘43 men’, and the ‘Zimmerkommandant’[5] is hit a staggering blow across the face, the ‘Zimmerkommandant’[5] should have reported ‘43 Jews’. And now there is the order ‘Wippen’[6]. This went on for an hour. Whoever did not do it precisely enough was called into the corridor, and returned covered in blood and with markings from lashes. And all the time horrible screaming, we could hear everything from the neighbouring rooms, and it was much crueller to hear the screams of the tortured men than to be the tortured person. We were lucky, our narrow room did not offer much opportunity for anything to happen, but next door there were large classrooms and there were lots of activities going on. In one room in particular there was a rabbi wearing a caftan, who especially attracted the beasts. They beat a rabbi wearing a caftan, who especially attracted the beasts to pieces, a rabbi wearing a caftan, who especially attracted the beasts's teeth, both cheek bones and the base of a rabbi wearing a caftan, who especially attracted the beasts's skull, for the latter they used their steel helmets and nothing was more horrible than to have to listen to these sounds and the wailing accompanying these sounds, which then changed into a rattle. When we saw a rabbi wearing a caftan, who especially attracted the beasts in a free moment we could hardly detect any human features in this wreck – everything was completely swollen. - 4 - In one room in particular there was an inmate who was even more miserable – if it could possibly get any worse – a young man, quite a dreamer, who suddenly decided to get onto the teacher’s desk and write a prayer on the blackboard. In this poem a young man, quite a dreamer, who suddenly decided to get onto the teacher’s desk and write a prayer on the blackboard suggested that the Jews and the NSDAP should become reconciled. At that very moment a young man, quite a dreamer, who suddenly decided to get onto the teacher’s desk and write a prayer on the blackboard was subjected to an inspection and a young man, quite a dreamer, who suddenly decided to get onto the teacher’s desk and write a prayer on the blackboard's idea was beaten out of a young man, quite a dreamer, who suddenly decided to get onto the teacher’s desk and write a prayer on the blackboard's head in the true sense of the word so that a young man, quite a dreamer, who suddenly decided to get onto the teacher’s desk and write a prayer on the blackboard died. Many more deaths followed there; from what we later learnt from conversations a number of twenty casualties did not seem to be exaggerated, for there were also suicides committed to put an end to these tortures to be taken into consideration. And ‘rock up and down’ again and again. the Viennese police poured buckets of water over those who could not carry on. That made the Viennese police continue. During the short breaks that we had when we were lying on the floor, covered in sweat, with our hearts beating violently, they thrust the windows open just to finish us off as quickly as possible. Suddenly at night the guard came and told the Zimmerkommandant that the guards wanted to have a good time and that all the money would have to be handed over to the guards. Anyone who was still found with money on the guard would be shot. After all the things that had happened already there was no doubt that the guards would keep the guards's word and we handed over all the money. In our room we had RM 540 so that in Dachau we did not have a single Groschen[7] left. Like the night to Sunday, 13 November, we passed Sunday, 13 November with rocking up and down and tortures. The house was filled with mad shouts, brutal blows, running blood – were these still human beings? At last, on Tuesday, 15 November, everything seemed to come to an end, we were prepared for the transport, and had to walk through a hall where young officials sitting at about 50 tables interrogated us and then made us sign a slip of paper more or less agreeing to renounce our property. Starved, no rest for 48 hours, the noise in a hall where young officials sitting at about 50 tables interrogated us and then made us sign a slip of paper more or less agreeing to renounce our property and the clattering of 50 typewriters – I had no idea what I was asked and what I signed; this was a very clever system to force people ‘to make confessions’ and ‘to make concessions’. Then we were put into police cars (in Vienna called ‘Grüner Heinrich’[8]) and were taken to the Elisabethpromenade. Again some optimists thought that this was the end of our suffering, but nothing could be further from the truth. True, we received the first cooked meal – soup followed by beans and bread – and slept standing in the corridors, because these masses could not be put up in the cells even though the Elisabethpromenade was a large building. But suddenly the the SS beasts appeared on the scene again, while we had thought we had got rid of the SS beasts, and now we knew that the torment would go on. Again we were - 5 - taken to a police officer who had the minutes of our interrogation in the Elisabethpromenade on a police officer who had the minutes of our interrogation in the Kenyongasse on his desk and he could decide according to his own judgement's desk and a police officer who had the minutes of our interrogation in the Kenyongasse on his desk and he could decide according to his own judgement could decide according to a police officer who had the minutes of our interrogation in the Kenyongasse on his desk and he could decide according to his own judgement's own judgement whether to send us to Vienna or home. Meanwhile the inhuman treatment by the SS was continuing there too, the horrible sounds of lashes with leather belts and the victims’ wailing could be heard, coming from a special room. My destination was Vienna and on Wednesday, 16 November, about 2 am, I was taken with my comrades in the ‘grünen Heinrich’ to the West Station, where we had to run the gauntlet through a row of SS men and were beaten again until we were loaded into cattle wagons. Here we spent the sixteen-hour journey, 70 men, without any food or liquid, without being able to relieve ourselves, and arrived in Vienna nearly suffocated. And yet we were luckier than those who travelled in passenger carriages, under guard, having to stare into lamps all the time whilst receiving constant inhuman beatings. Many of those who travelled in passenger carriages, under guard, having to stare into lamps all the time whilst receiving constant inhuman beatings went out of their minds, jumped out of the window and were ‘shot whilst escaping'. Though it may seem absurd, for us inmates of the Elisabethpromenade, Vienna (see the attached sketch) almost meant recreation after these many inhuman and unpredictable excesses. For everything there was organised by drill and according to rules that had previously been laid down precisely. At 5 am we had to get up, at 5.30 everybody had to be washed and have relieved themselves, and lined up in rank and file ready for breakfast, while a company that changed every week had to have tidied up the rooms and washed the floors, the wash-room, the toilets and the anteroom within this half-hour. After breakfast, which consisted of a black drink that was at least warm but had nothing whatsoever to do with coffee we again had to line up in rank and file, and then the whole camp, Jews and Aryans, marched to the nearest police station for the so-called roll-call, which took place twice daily, in the morning and in the evening. And it would have been possible to discover any losses at once. At 6.45 am we arrived at the nearest police station and had to stay standing to attention there for one hour until the report leader had reported the state of the camp to the camp commander and then we left again in rows for work, having been ordered, ‘March off!’ The work for us ‘Aktionsjuden’[9] was drilling and physical exercises until midday, then there was lunch consisting of vegetables and minute pieces of tinned meat, or rice with milk, or sago with milk, and bread, a ration of a quarter loaf of army bread per person per day, which you had to budget yourself. At 1.00 pm the lunch break was over, we lined up and marched again to the parade ground where The work for us ‘Aktionsjuden’[9] was organised. In particular Aryans were sent to work outside the camp, heavily guarded. When the organising was finished we Jews marched back to we Jews's barracks and also did we Jews's ‘work’, namely marching and physical exercises. - 6 - That went on until about 5.00 pm, when we came to the nearest police station for the evening roll-call. These roll-calls were the most unpleasant institution of the camp. When we arrived at Vienna we had had to hand over most of our clothes and shoes and in exchange had been given military shoes, stockings and a uniform, which was made of canvas and was in fact just a pair of pyjamas. We had already been shorn. So when during These roll-calls rain and snow fell onto our heads and shoulders and ran down our bodies and These roll-calls had already lasted one hour and did not seem to be coming to an end, most of us thought that we would not be able to stand the evening roll-call much longer. For usually we were obviously left standing longer in bad weather than when the weather was fine. Later, when just before Christmas strong frost set in and the icy wind went through and through on the open parade ground so that we thought the marrow in our bones had already grown stiff and we could only drag ourselves along bent double because our groins hurt so much, we looked as if we had come from Dante’s Inferno. We were glad when we came to our hard beds – there was only straw to lie on and our cover was a flannel blanket – quickly ate our evening meal, soup or sausage or cheese and lime-blossom tea, washed our basins and lay down. At about the time when the frost set in the effects of our standing mercilessly for hours in the open air became visible. All our hands and feet were swollen from strong frost, the swellings of many had already broken open and that was the beginning of the end because this always brought about an infection. True, in Vienna there were two barracks for hospital treatment. But hospital treatment was reserved only for infectious diseases and temperatures above 40°C. People with frostbite, however, got only outpatient treatment by Aryan inmates, who had qualified as medical orderlies, but only in the afternoon between 3.00 and 4.30 pm. Bearing in mind that with the continuing frost between 200 and 300 people came every day to be treated and that during this short span there were only four medical orderlies to see to only four medical orderlies to see to them, one can understand that not even every tenth patient could be treated and that the continuing frost kept progressing. At last there was only one way out, namely the medical orderlies stole the dressing material and the ointments although the dressing material and the ointments were threatened with severe punishment, and sold the dressing material and the ointments to the Jews for a few marks, and in two barracks for hospital treatment the imprisoned doctors took over the further treatment. Unfortunately very often the dressing material and the ointments were found out during controls and many a blow was dealt. But when these treatments were no longer sufficient and there were the first casualties caused by frostbite that was obviously too much even for the camp authorities and during the last days before Christmas the work, that is our staying out in the open air, was limited to the two roll-calls, in the morning and in the evening, and the rest of the time we sat in our room which was at least lightly heated. Round about Christmas we had been in the camp for five weeks, we had had a bath just once, namely when we were taken there, and there had never been - 7 - fresh straw. It was only natural that in some blocks there were lice. As a punishment the inmates of some blocks had to take off all the inmates of these blocks's clothes on the parade ground until the inmates of these blocks were stark naked, and at last the inmates of these blocks had a shower and received fresh underwear and clothes, and the inmates of these blocks's straw was also exchanged. One block (= barracks) had a special stroke of luck in adversity: there was a case of typhoid which put One block (= barracks) into quarantine for three weeks, just at a time when it was extremely cold (-15°C) and we did not go outside at all. I can honestly say that three weeks was a bitter time; you were never safe, and I was overcome by joy, when on the day before Christmas in the early morning I heard my name when the names of those who were to be released were read out. What did it matter that on the day before Christmas we were left without any food from 6.00 am until 7.00 pm; after all, we were free at last and the heavy gates closed behind us for ever after 60 hard and bitter days.

61,"[""A vivid report on illegal life in Holland by Mrs Selma Frank. Mrs Selma Frank lived in Rotterdam until September 1940 when all Jews of foreign extraction had to leave the costal zone of 40 km. in width. Mrs Selma Frank went as a housekeeper to the Marcus family in Zwolle. the Marcus family in Zwolle became great friends and Mrs Selma Frank was treated as a member of the Marcus family in Zwolle. Already in October 1940 the razzias on Jews started and quite a number of well-to-do business men disappeared. Mrs Selma Frank decided to go underground and though Mrs Selma Frank came secretly home from time to time Mrs Selma Frank did not openly return before 27 April 1945. In the beginning Mrs Selma Frank was regularly called for by the Sicherheitspolizei. Mrs Selma Frank's wife became deputy manager of Mrs Selma Frank's firm at Zwolle and his firm at Zwolle's branch in the Hague had a very unpleasant time. All anti-Jewish-Measures - the David’s Shield; special Jewish food rations; prohibition to use public conveyances; curfew; deportations (Westerbork) - which in Germany were gradually introduced during 5 years, were imposed on Holland within a year. In autumn 1942 the whole Mrs Selma Frank family (including Mrs Selma Frank) went underground under the name of Gelderland (forged papers). the Marcus family in Zwolle stayed at a remote village in Holland - Hoogkeppel - in a small boarding house. But a remote village in the country - Hoogkeppel - did not last very long. In May 1943 the Marcus family in Zwolle had to leave because the son of the Marcus family in Zwolle's hosts, a policeman, was afraid of the danger for the son of their hosts, a policeman's parents. Now the Marcus family in Zwolle split up. Mrs Selma Frank, after several changes of place, went to Noordwolte as a ‘friend’ of a large family with 4 children, helping the housewife. When the fifth child was born, there was no more room for Mrs Selma Frank in a small boarding house, and again Mrs Selma Frank had to move. Mrs Selma Frank's last stay was at Murmerwoude (Friesland) where Mrs Selma Frank lived in the very centre of the “Underground Resistance”. Mr and Mrs Sierke Schaafsma, Mrs Selma Frank's hosts, were genuinely relgious people. According to Mrs Selma Frank it was not only a nerve-racking, but also a most interesting and, historically speaking, important life Mr and Mrs Sierke Schaafsma, her hosts were leading: Mr and Mrs Sierke Schaafsma, her hosts hid people and incriminating material; held secret meetings etc.etc. Mrs Selma Frank praises the courage and independent spirit of the average Dutch people. The province of Friesland was liberated by the Canadians on 12 April 1945. It took almost another month (5 May 1945) before the west of Holland was liberated, too. Mrs Selma Frank describes the riots of joy, the cheers of the population, with which the Canadians were greeted. 9.

This evening Emil want to try after all, to finally give you the report, which Emil promised to you long ago, about the last 3 years. Whether Emil’ll succeed in being reasonably clear, remains to be seen. - Emil probably don’t have to write to you more about the invasion on 10th May 1940 and the difficult years for the entire Dutch people resulting from the invasion on 10th May 1940. You have read enough about the invasion on 10th May 1940, heard on the radio, etc. Anyhow, with that difficult day the misery of the entire Dutch people began. - First, all foreign Jews who had been living in Holland up to a date fixed by the Nazis (Emil didn’t fall into this category back then), had to report, the second, very radical measure also affected Emil - within 2 days all foreign Jews who had come to Holland after '33 had to leave the coastal zone up to a depth of 40 km on 8th September 1940. Whoever had been living in Rotterdam could stay, whereas nobody was allowed to move to Rotterdam - it was very hard for Emil, as Emil's acquaintances mostly were emigrants who had been living in the coastal zone, and what Emil considered a severe measure back then, was to prove lucky later - of 12,000 Rotterdam Jews only 500! came back. You know, through a boarder (Herbert Bouscher), whose sister had been living in Zwolle, he a boarder (Herbert Bouscher), whose sister had been living in Zwolle, he himself had been with his fiancée in Enschede since July had been with a boarder (Herbert Bouscher), whose sister had been living in Zwolle, he himself had been with his fiancée in Enschede since July's fiancée in Enschede since July, Emil had an address that Emil contacted by phone and with success. On Sunday, 8th September Emil took leave of Rotterdam. Jenny Goldschmidt took Emil to the station - and at 5 o’clock Emil was in Zwolle where a boarder (Herbert Bouscher), whose sister had been living in Zwolle, he himself had been with his fiancée in Enschede since July and a boarder (Herbert Bouscher), whose sister had been living in Zwolle, he himself had been with his fiancée in Enschede since July's fiancée, who happened to be in Zwolle, picked Emil up. How Emil went from there, Eva still knows - on 26th October 40 Emil came to the Marcus family as “Juffrouw in de huishousing” (housemaid, W.L.). Emil, do Emil know who Frau Marens is, née Loeb from Kassel, Emil remember, that Emil should have gone to her father in Kassel in 1929, and Emil informed Emil - back then she was about to get married and they wanted a housekeeper - life has coincidences. Since then Emil have stayed with them continuously and Emil's home was here, as far as one can have a home at other people’s places. Here in the community Emil was warmly welcomed and then Emil also had, as far as time allowed, pleasant days. - The situation intensified and on 12th March 41 all Jews in Holland had to report - back then everyone made the same mistake, nobody had to report, that way they had the required lists after all! In July 41 all people over 15 years old got all people over 15 years old's Persoonsbewyse and us, of course with a thick “J” on Persoonsbewyse, Emil as “Vreemdeling” (foreigner, W.L.) in a different colour at that. In the summer of 41 the first Jewish boys were taken away from the street in Rotterdam and sent to Mauthausen, the first Jewish boys were reported dead within a couple of weeks. There are Loodmeinen (lead-mining complex, W.L.), in order to work there, the way of life must primarily include drinking a lot of milk and working 3 - 4 hours on a daily basis. - 2 - What the dogs did with the first Jewish boys, Emil probably don’t have to tell you. First, the first Jewish boys were taken away, but then this degenerated into raids, which spread from Rotterdam to the provinces. In the beginning of October, Enschede had a raid of/by the Gestapo and Gruenen in a night of terror and 100 respected and leading Jewish men became the victims of which none returned. Then it was Apeldoorn’s turn, closer and closer to Zwolle - in Apeldoorn’s the police were informed and was able to warn the people just in time - then there was an alert for several nights as well and our husbands didn’t sleep at home and indeed, in the night of 10th October (Suckaus) at ½3 the doorbell rang - Emil will never forget that (Mrs Frank called Emil and Emil walked downstairs with Mrs Frank) - to our surprise, no German police were standing there but Dutch police in plain clothes (inquiries) asked if Herrn Marcus could use our phone, went upstairs, cut the line (in the year Nov. 1938!) and asked for Herrn Marcus. Herrn Marcus had been on a business trip and came back after a few days !! Minute was taken down, the entire house was searched and with a Suchten (sigh W.L.) “I hope that the entire house can be combed fast”, Herrn Marcus left the entire house. - 50 men were on a list and 7 of 50 men received a list, the Nazis were angry about the “alleged leak” within the police of Zwolle - with those people who were partly ill at the “alleged leak” within the police of Zwolle those people who were partly ill at that couldn’t do anything, after a few days those people who were partly ill at that were released. On the next day at 11 o’clock the police came, Mrs Selma Frank had to go to the police building which Mrs Selma Frank then did - with all other ladies Mrs Selma Frank was detained for “questioning” - when Mrs Selma Frank still wasn’t home at 9 o’clock in the evening, Emil had uneasy feelings. - Finally, at 8 o’clock in the evening questioning by the Sicherheitspolizei which, as you know from personal experience, was not pleasant.All, or most women adhered to All, or most women's statement of the night despite all threats and the men achieved very little, the men were angry and even angrier - as we heard later, the men asked in Germany to bring the women to a camp, there the men didn’t have any interest in the women, it didn’t pass. At 1/2 10 the women were released. It was a day which conjured up old memories of the day of the invasion on 10th May 1940. Mrs Selma Frank was gone and stayed away/continued to do so until 27th April 1945! So we had been living alone for 10 months, a long and exciting time. During the first weeks strenuous request on the part of the Dutch police whether Mrs Selma Frank is back, for 7 weeks Mrs Selma Frank had been hunted in the police journal, later the Dutch police didn’t show that much interest in Mrs Selma Frank anymore. In December call by the “Joodsche Raad” (we later called it Joodsche “Verraad” (treachery W.L.), all men must return, nothing will happen to all men (how naive all men were!) Mrs Selma Frank didn’t return despite many people’s effort. Mrs Selma Frank ran the firm with the staff and the branch in the Hague alone. On 1st January 1942 the Nuremberg Laws came into effect here, as a result our girl had to leave. So we found ourselves alone with our house and business. A few times during the first 5 months Mrs Selma Frank was at home (in secret) one evening at Chanukah, dressed as Chanukah man Mrs Selma Frank saw the children who hadn’t known anything about Mrs Selma Frank being at home, what a comedy. - Then all gold and silver had to be handed in, the entire asset had to be sent to “Bankhaus Lippmann - Rosendaal”, virtually everything here took place within one year, as opposed to Germany. Moreover, there was not a single possibility to emigrate here. - 3 - And the war went so well for the Moffen (offensive word for Germans, W.L.) the war was a hopeless, terrifying situation. In March 1942 Emil lost Emil's German citizenship, Emil had to go to Rotterdam in person for 3 days, providing all details and going through the formalities at the Joodschen Raad, resulted in a visit at the German Sicherheitspolizei, where the German Sicherheitspolizei take away your passport and finally, the German Sicherheitspolizei tell you in a rather rude tone “You can go” - details about this visit Emil’ll tell you at a later time. In 3 days, when Emil was living with the family Fühl as usual, but had no specific additional costs, Emil made so much time for visiting the boys in Haarlem, after that Emil saw Herrn Marcus for the last time! At that time Emil already had to have a permit to travel, which even cost something, all these things were organised through the Joodschen Raad and Emil came back as stateless person, great, right? Here Emil got a passport for stateless persons at the police and had to report again after half a year - fortunately, that didn’t happen. Most of the Jewish shops had to be shut down, some important people got an administrator - so did we. First a German administrator came into the shop in Den Haag, who then came to “visit” us with our boss there in May - they were hardly gone, when a fat N.S.B. (Nationalsozialistische Bewegung, W.L.) from Rijswijk came and introduced a fat N.S.B. (Nationalsozialistische Bewegung, W.L.) from Rijswijk as administrator for our shop here - that was a day! The difficulties were piling up, Mrs Frank was helping at first, later Mrs Frank wasn’t allowed to do so anymore - money, to live, wasn’t given to us anymore from the shop in Den Haag, neither to pay Emil. We weren’t allowed anymore to answer the phone, all in all, an unacceptable situation. Because we are not allowed to live in the house anymore, they held that off for a while after all - and before they threw us out of the house, we had left voluntarily, that is to say going into hiding. In July we had to hand in all bikes within 2 days, we sabotaged, handed in one bike, which was then changed for a very bad one, and have the others disappear - unfortunately, they cheated us with that later, we got back very bad bikes, which we needed when we had been in hiding, and now we are practically all without bikes, in any case, the Nazis didn’t get bikes, then better Dutch people. So Emil could still write you more details - then the yellow badge came, which we all wore with pride and the yellow badge was striking, people who didn’t know you greeted with such respect that the Moffen didn’t know what to do. Now going to the market was prohibited - grocery shopping done only between 3 and 5 o’clock, when/where in times of shortage practically everything is sold out, also in this case the Dutch population acted in a very decent way, the Dutch population reserved everything for us. Then, exactly three years ago, our loved ones were deported in Duisburg, which certainly took a lot of strength of nerve, the preparations for “going into hiding” great Emoties (anxiety, W.L.) about everything, that happened to the poor Jews every day - all in all - it couldn’t get any worse. Many people, who were panic-stricken and lost, one tried to support Many people, who were panic-stricken and lost. The Joodsche Raad made lists of everything one had to bring to Apeldoorn’s. We this act these measures tooth and nail and considered this act as dirty work for the Gestapo. - 4 - You see, Emil write by candlelight, since one week we have electricity again, however, we are only allowed to use one kW a week, gas since the day before yesterday one hour per day - just as an aside. Emil hadn’t felt well for months, went from the family doctor to the gynaecologist on 3rd Aug. shortly after the examination the family doctor advised Emil to undergo a surgery, Emil spontaneously went, once a room had been available, to the hospital on 6th Aug. and underwent surgery successfully on 7th August - Emil’ll tell Eva about that in writing. a surgery was a very difficult surgery, which luckily went fine. On 8th Aug. our two children Frintje and Judith were the first who left, Emil didn’t know about it, Emil heard about it on 9th Aug. our firm was was closed for business for some days due to holidays and was the perfect time to disappear. On 9th Aug. Mrs Selma Frank was with Emil during the visiting time as usual, Emil asked Mrs Selma Frank, as Mrs Selma Frank was alone, had to walk everywhere, as we were not allowed to use an omnibus or a bike anymore, not to go the long way so often, on 10th Aug. at noon, Francis came, the oldest, still in blazing sun with a bag full of restorative food, Emil also asked Mrs Selma Frank, to tell Mrs Selma Frank's mother that her mother shouldn’t come to visit that day which her mother also promised Emil to tell - at the next noon during the visiting time one of our young people from the firm came and told Emil, Mrs Selma Frank and Mrs Selma Frank are gone since yesterday noon at 5 o’clock. Emil’ll never forget this moment in Emil's life - it seems that everything has been taken care of for Emil, even arranged with the doctors, who were privy to it, to keep Emil in the hospital until Emil was able to travel in order to follow the doctors, who were privy to it. Emil was still very weak and had to digest so many things, but Emil had to put on a brave face in front of the other patients - it wasn’t easy. Their journey went well, they went to Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded, and Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded was happy, having sat in a room all by Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded for 10 months, to be with all. During the last 5 months Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded had been with a clergyman and Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded's wife provided us with this “Schuilplaats” (hiding place, W.L.) Practically, Emil was completely alone, but Emil had so many visitors, with every imaginable nice gift, that the weeks still had passed quickly. Leaving the house Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded was a sensation as we were the very first ones. Mrs Selma Frank was very concerned about Emil, that the Gestapo might be sent to Emil's bedside in order to question Emil, but Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded didn’t take it that far. Our staff visited Emil regularly and so Emil still heard a thing or two. On 6th September Emil was discharged, a Jewish lady brought Emil on foot! to two old aunts of Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded (Emil wasn’t allowed to use a vehicle). At 7 o’clock Emil left the hospital, it was still a long way and as a Jew a Jewish lady had to be home at 8 o’clock. Considering how they bullied us, it was very bad. On 8th September 42 a clergyman's wife picked Emil up here and with His wife Emil travelled “without badge” and a permit to travel to Fam. Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded later told dear Eva, how beautifully the small village Hoogkeppel is situated. We were very happy to meet again and Emil wanted so badly to make dear Eva understand, dear Eva, that the ideal stay in Holland had the ideal stay in the country's reasonable Reden (reason, W.L.), but Emil couldn’t back then. We had delicious fruits there, - 5 - the children enjoyed that quiet rural life and together, we sat comfortably at the table in our own Huiskamer (living room, W.L.) which was very special for Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded. At the end of Oct. the children had to leave, it wasn’t possible any longer, the holidays were long gone and what excuse we had had to use when talking to other people about why the children didn’t go to school. In the garden Emil helped Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded to dig up all potatoes for the people, later to dig up tubers, etc. and once the work was finished, we read a lot, made a lot of handicrafts etc. - the winter was long and one was close to Stalingrad - it went sooo well for the Germans, until finally, the situation changed with the defeat at Stalingrad. Back then, we still listened to the engl. channel on a regular basis and even the smallest victory of the Russians and the allies gave us new hope. Emil forgot to tell that it was impossible for us to be at the address of our hiding place with our identity card with a “J”, at the first check not only us, also the people who had taken us in, would have been arrested and brought to a concentration camp. Back then, good Dutch citizens had “lost” good Dutch citizens's Persoonsbewijze (identity cards, W.L.) for us, which means, at the authority good Dutch citizens stated that good Dutch citizens lost their Persoonsbewijze (identity cards, W.L.), received new ones and provided the Jews in hiding with good Dutch citizens (later the numbers of the lost P.B. were all blocked) many were also abusing their Persoonsbewijze (identity cards, W.L.) and a bad P.B. often cost 300 - 500 fl. Such a P.B. was placed at Emil's Beschicking (disposal, W.L.) - Emil's name was Heintjen Benner- Smeek, was born in Doetinchem and married in Havelte. The only thing that was changed was the photo, which had to be done properly. The fingerprints, signature, everything was forged. So Emil had been living with Such a P.B. for over a year. By the way, Emil was never checked in over a year. In addition to a P.B. each citizen had a distribution card and without a distribution card, you couldn’t get a ration coupon. In the beginning everything went fine with us, the local “Ophaal- dienst” (pick-up service, W.L.) had our distribution card and arranged for our ration coupons on a regular basis. Later, that was forbidden for the local “Ophaal- dienst” (pick-up service, W.L.) and nobody could get ration coupons for our distribution card anymore, that was a critical time. Although we had been living in the countryside, where we had potatoes and vegetables, everything else, bread, butter, sugar, meat, etc. could only be verstrekt (delivered, W.L.) when holding ration coupons and especially at a time, when we had to change our Schuilplaats (hiding place, W.L.), we had to face this difficulty. Later, when many more youths in hiding followed, everybody who wasn’t going to Germany for work deployment, went into hiding, an organisation came across Holland, called “De Onder- grondse” (The Underground, W.L.), which had its Knockpfluege, raided Distributiekantoren (distribution offices, W.L.) and took thousands of ration books with Distributiekantoren (distribution offices, W.L., so that we were not in distress anymore, we still had to pay fl. 7.50 per month though, which others disapproved of later, more on than later when we get to talk. So we stayed at our first Schuilplaats (hiding place, W.L.) until the beginning of May, in the meanwhile our 4. daughter, Leonietje was born on 14th March “in secret” in the hospital in Doetinchem, where she stayed with the mother for 4 weeks, then the mother was brought - 6 - to us again by car, our baby stayed with us for 2 hrs - then our baby had to leave the mother - ergens in Nederland - (somewhere in Holland, W.L.) whereto, we didn’t know, what that means for a mother, Emil guess Emil don’t have to tell you. As Emil already mentioned, we all had to leave in the beginning of May - the son of the people who had taken us in, was in Limburg in the police and didn’t wish, that the son of the people who had taken us in's parents were playing that dangerous game any longer, to have Jews in the house, and wrote a very clear letter concerning that matter - with the result, we had to, even to the chagrin of his parents, leave. Emil was the first one who went - without having a permanent place, on 7th May 43 (surrender at Tunis) by train to “Zwolle” - went to Spoolde near “Zwolle and surprised an old woman of more dan (than, W.L.) 80 years with Emil's presence - an old woman of more dan (than, W.L.) 80 years with my presence was glad and anxious at the same time, when an old woman of more dan (than, W.L.) 80 years with my presence saw Emil - an old woman of more dan (than, W.L.) 80 years with my presence didn’t want to send Emil away and was very worried that Emil was with an old woman of more dan (than, W.L.) 80 years with my presence. Back then we were under “Staat van beleg”, siege, the death penalty was imposed for everything and you can imagine how anxious this old woman, who absolutely wanted to help Emil, was. Emil comforted an old woman of more dan (than, W.L.) 80 years with my presence that it maybe was for 4-8 days, maybe a little longer, they were at work for Emil, only that the right thing hadn’t been found yet (it was very difficult during that time to find something for Jews). Over the days an old woman of more dan (than, W.L.) 80 years with my presence calmed down, Emil was in Emil's room upstairs a lot, darned many bed sheets for an old woman of more dan (than, W.L.) 80 years with my presence's etc. and everything went fine. After almost 14 days (Emil was in contact with the boss of Our staff), the Juffrow (miss, W.L.) also came, who provided for Emil and told Emil, that Emil had to be at the house Marcus at 4 o’clock the next day at noon with a Perronkarte, the destination was withheld from Emil, as everything was always dealt with secretly and in an odd way. Then Emil arrived in Apeldoorn’s next evening. There two ladies were waiting for us at the exit who were both introduced to Emil as Mevr. van Minnen, the younger immediately started a very friendly discussion, which Emil could conclude from, that Emil’ll stay with the lady and that until the end of April 4 mon. our Judith, back then 41/2 years old, was with the lady. Emil had no idea where the lady lived, Emil thought in Apeldoorn’s, Emil then heard that the lady had come to the lady's parents-in-law to L., to receive Emil - the next morning we went back the same way to Steewijk again and then with a light railway to Noordwolte - a place of destination. The evening before we discussed everything down to the last detail, Emil’m the friend of Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded, Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded's name was Cris, we turned Heintjen into a Hennie and so Emil remained Hennie until the defeat at Stalingrad. Heintjen had 4 children and was expecting the 5. Heintjen's husband is a teacher at a secondary school, very nice people - but a household, here you speak of “Jan Steen” - Emil was quite shocked when Emil saw this chaos. As a hiding person you are always thankful and glad when kind and good people help you again and Emil also felt that way. Emil was supposed to stay 3-4 months and stayed until shortly before the delivery 5 1/2 mon. they couldn’t keep Emil longer as Emil's small room, which actually belonged to the oldest boy of 11 years, was needed for the nurse. After 14 days to top it all His wife left and Emil struggled hard all summer - although Emil really liked Heintjen, truth be told, Heintjen avoided any work and kept Emil in suspense - those are the Reden (reasons, W.L) Heintjen cannot get any help because - 7 - Heintjen simply leaves everything to others and sits down to read quietly, or runs errands by bike without being aware that you also have to come back home again. During that time Emil had been through difficult things, the deportation of Alfred and Walter. Emil received mail from the boys 3.- and 4.-hand, from Hilde and Leo, who Emil’ll continue to call that, Emil heard nothing for months, had no idea where they were. In September 1943 Emil was completely out of touch with Alfred as Alfred had been sent to Apeldoorn’s and to Walter, who came to Apeldoorn’s only on Rausch Haschonoh, (Alfred was already gone back then) Emil still wrote until Nov. and then Walter also had to leave. Emil was often driven to despair, Emil wanted and had to be cheerful and optimistic, it hadn’t always worked if you have to process so many great misfortunes, except Cris, who then felt sympathy for Emil, had nobody, no shoulder to cry on, then sometimes you are at a loss, so Emil went to the cows in the meadow and often had a good cry there. Finally, about our boss in The Hague, who did a lot for us, contact with Hilde and Leo, called Greet and Willem ! Hilde and Leo, called Greet and Willem were in Limburg in the village “America” since July - primitive is not a word, with very ordinary, relatively undeveloped people, however, but extraordinary good and well-behaved. Hilde and Leo, called Greet and Willem stayed there for 10 months. What such a letter meant for Emil, you can well imagine - later mail arrived more often. In October, Emil think it was 8th Sept. surrender by Germany - then great enthusiasm, people thought, in 4 weeks time the 3. Reich will collapse too - it was a fallacy. After October the total war came and the entire Dutch people had to suffer tremendously and go through a lot. Every day more and more people went into hiding, the resistance against the enemy and the measures got stronger daily. Until that moment the Jewish program was executed and they had all time to dash against the good Dutch people, which they did eventually. Over and over again one saw the raid cars with the “Gruenen” dragging off some of the finest citizens, most of some of the finest citizens have not seen their homeland ever again. The situation intensified daily - raids on homes in order to look for radios, much treachery by N.S.B. claimed the lives of many fine citizens - On 17th November Emil left Apeldoorn’s with tears in Emil's eyes in order to stay in Leeuwarden for a few days until the Juffr. came to pick Emil up again. We agreed that this should take place after 1-2 days, 1-2 days turned into 3 long, anxious weeks during which Emil was waiting. Her husband was faint-hearted, and on top of that, sick during that time, absolutely willing to help but the mental power is the prerequisite for such cases. They were very nice to Emil, the Juffr. didn’t bring Emil's distribution card and what that means for a family of 2 people, to keep the third one, is enormous. But everything went well - on 7th Dec. in the morning, we were told by Herrn Marcus, who had found a little guest house for us 6 in the meanwhile, in the middle of the forest, marvellously secluded over the phone, that a boy had been born (we had been waiting for that too for 3 weeks) and finally at noon a “Telefoontje” (phone call, W.L.) came in for Emil, that Emil had to be at the “Tramstation” in Apeldoorn’s at 4 o’clock, a “Telefoontje” (phone call, W.L.) had to show Emil something and Emil would be back home again in the evening - showing Emil something Emil understood well, a “Telefoontje” (phone call, W.L.) had to see Emil - if one happens to have a very Jewish appearance, then one is not suitable for every position. In this respect - 8 - Emil's fate was particularly beneficial, as everyone told Emil with a certain gasp of relief that you don’t look Jewish at all, or in Dutch, men kan helemaal niet zien dat U een Jodin is (one cannot tell at all that you are Jewish, W.L.) Do Emil have to be particularly grateful to Emil's dear parents for this? Again, Emil went on a very “geheimzinnige” (secret, W.L.) journey, in the meanwhile a very “geheimzinnige” (secret, W.L.) journey had already darkened and in Murmer-woude a gentleman was waiting, who received us - a gentleman was a Herr Halte from Dokkum, who now holds an important position at the “Miliar Gezag” (military administration, W.L.) in Apeldoorn’s - a Herr Halte from Dokkum, who now holds an important position at the “Miliar Gezag” (military administration, W.L.) in Leeuwarden took us to a large family with 4 children, told us that the Baas (boss, W.L.) would not be home yet, a Herr Halte from Dokkum, who now holds an important position at the “Miliar Gezag” (military administration, W.L.) in Leeuwarden was at a farmer to get milk - we rang the doorbell. Mevr. Schaafsma opened the door and took us to the office. Emil thought from here Emil will be “negotiated” again and when Emil was asked later if Emil didn’t want to put off Emil's coat, Emil ans",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

63,"['The authoress was the only child of a well-off manufacturer in Vienna. In 1935 under the influence of the political situation, a well-off manufacturer in Vienna moved with a well-off manufacturer in Vienna's family to Krakow, where a well-off manufacturer in Vienna owned another factory. They lived in a most comfortable flat and the daughter studied philology, German and English. the author reports here on the situation in Poland of the Jews, after the German army had occupied Poland. In 1940 the Jews were in Cracow (p.1, 3), in 1941 the Czknstochow Ghetto. This report includes details on Gestapo-chief Degenhard, the deportation to Treblinka of the older people (p.2), forced labour and ill-treatment for the remaining thousand by German SS, Ukrainians and Latvians (p.2-3). The authoress escaped together with the author's husband to “Nutzjuden” working outside the Czknstochow Ghetto, from there to Warsaw. Details forged documents and a job with the German “Ost Energie A.G.“. After several months of living with the family of a Polish army-officer (belonging, then unknown to them, to the Resistance Movement), everybody living in and arriving at the house was arrested and put in irons (p.4). Then, the Jews were taken to prison (Montelupe) and later back to the Czknstochow Ghetto. The authoress whose husband was a doctor, never saw him again (p.4-5). The women had to spend two months at Helclow after which all prisoners were transported to Auschwitz. Non-Jews helping Jews: an SS-official, like The authoress a grammar-school mistress, and a lady-doctor, interned as a Resistance-member, helped the author to get a job with the Commando “Bauleitung“, where the author worked for two years for the Chief, Sturmbannführer Bischof who proved to be human and helpful (p.6); their ‘Model Block’shown to Swedish Control Commission, in 1944; another model block was the ‘Experimental Block’ with lady-doctor Brewda, now London, and Dr. Fleck, Dr. Fleck, his wife and child - the only child at Auschwitz - who returned back to Paris's wife and child - the only child at Auschwitz - who returned back to Paris (p.6). On 17 January 1945 the author was evacuated and sent on a two-week death march to the Jiell of Ravensbrück. In February, the author was transferred to nearby Malchow labour camp. Liberated on 9 April 1945 (p.6), the march back to Poland. Since 1946 the author has been working with the Polish embassy in London. the author has remarried and had a child; when the author was called back to Poland; the author left the author's job and stayed in England. Shorthand-Typist at AuschwitzMy father had two large factories. AuschwitzMy father manufactured a well-known brand of cigarette. One of two large factories was in Krakow, the other was in Vienna. When the author was born, in the year 1916, the author's parents lived in Vienna. But when in 1935 Hitler’s effect on the economic situation in Austria began to be felt, we moved to Krakow.In Krakow we had a beautiful, elegant flat; we lived a secure, pleasant life; the author studied Philology, German and English. the author's knowledge of Philology, German and English would be of great help to the author later on. the author was an only child and had everything the author could have wished for. When war broke out in 1939 and the Germans invaded Poland, we immediately had to leave our flat in a luxury apartment block, the same as all the other Jews.During the first few months after the occupation things remained very calm in Krakow. Now and then, raids took place; young, strong men and women were picked up from work or from the street and young, strong men and women had to help with building work, wash cars, carry heavy goods. But in the evening young, strong men and women returned home again. Then the order came out that all Jews had to wear the blue-white star of David. As the author did not look Jewish at all, the author did not wear the blue-white star of David and often travelled to the countryside from where the author brought back provisions because nutrition in Poland was not too good at that time. In 1940 the first notification was issued that Jews had to live together in a Jewish Quarter. After we had left our old flat, we had found a very nice flat which happened to be within this area allocated to Jews. Thus, we had peace of mind for a while. Such Jews who did not have prominent or important positions, were left in peace at first. From time to time, Germans arrived to collect valuables; Germans searched a very nice flat which happened to be within this area allocated to Jews; to begin with, Jews had to deliver Jews's furs, later jewellery and other valuables. But at this stage, we were not yet tortured.Then we had to leave Krakow and moved to Czenstochow which is situated between Krakow and Warsaw. That was in 1941. Here, too, there was not yet a proper Ghetto, but the Jews were only permitted to live in certain streets; however, with the blue-white star of David, the Jews were allowed to go about where the Jews pleased. Our bank accounts had been instantly blocked, and we lived from the sale of valuables. There, we had a very poor flat, but the author succeeded in finding pupils for German lessons, with the author's knowledge of languages, and thus to help the author's parents. Of course, in those days it was useful to speak and understand English. Jewish children were then no longer allowed to attend Polish schools, and so the author created private courses where the author taught Latin, English and German.Here, too, raids took place from time to time, here, too, young men and women were picked up to do hard labour, but young men and women returned in the evening.Then the Jewish Quarter was declared a Ghetto and enclosed. Jewish police were stationed at the entrance and exit. On the eve of the Jewish Day of Atonement, Degenhard, the chief of the Gestapo, spoke to the Chairman of the Jewish Community and declared that Degenhard, the chief of the Gestapo wished the Jews good luck for the New Year. Degenhard, the chief of the Gestapo said that in Degenhard, the chief of the Gestapo's district nothing would happen to the Jews. The very next day, the police surrounded the Czknstochow Ghetto, nobody was allowed to leave the house. For two weeks, house by house, people were selected for deportation. The Jewish police assisted the Germans in deportation.Each house was processed separately. The victims had to march past Degenhard, the chief of the Gestapo in a long queue. The old and frail were immediately loaded onto lorries and sent to Treblinka where The old and frail were gassed. Amongst The old and frail were the author's poor parents; the author never saw my poor parents again.The old and frail were beaten by Degenhard, the chief of the Gestapo with Degenhard, the chief of the Gestapo's riding crop and we then returned to the Czknstochow Ghetto. the Czknstochow Ghetto was now surrounded with barbed wire.We were now just roughly 1000 young men and women. We had to work in factories, mistreated and watched by men who were largely members of the Gestapo from the Ukraine and Austria and who were particularly cruel.We had to share a room with 4 or 5 others and were sent to clean the flats vacated by those who had been deported. It was an irony of fate that the author found the author in our old flat which the author had to clean and tidy up.At that time the author was engaged and had even, when the author's parents were still alive, been married by a Rrabbi in the Czknstochow Ghetto. the author's fiance who had friends who were working outside the Czknstochow Ghetto as so-called “commodity Jews” (Nutzjuden) suggested that we might try to escape. friends who were working outside the Ghetto as so-called “commodity Jews” (Nutzjuden) worked in small factories as tailors or cobblers. friends who were working outside the Ghetto as so-called “commodity Jews” (Nutzjuden) had to alter items of clothing that had been taken from the deported and to repair the shoes.We actually succeeded in leaving the Czknstochow Ghetto unnoticed and to reach friends who were working outside the Ghetto as so-called “commodity Jews” (Nutzjuden) where we remained until it was dark. Then we took the night train to Krakow. We had no papers, but in Krakow we had an address of Jews who would help us further.One small detail probably saved the author's life. For inexplicable reasons, the author's mother had insisted that the author include a hat when we were packing the most important items into the author's rucksack to take into the Czknstochow Ghetto. At the time it seemed ridiculous to the author. However, the author obeyed. So when we were fleeing it turned out that a hat was a real protection. Of course, most Jewish women had not brought hats with most Jewish women, at most most Jewish women wore headscarves. Thus, none of the informers suspected that the author was indeed a Jew.We found the Jews in Krakow who were the Jews in Krakow who were themselves in danger and could not take us in in danger and could not take us in. But the Jews in Krakow who were themselves in danger and could not take us in gave us the address of a Polish family who, for a substantial payment, let a room to us. The husband was a Polish military officer. Apart from us, there was another family living there, and we found out quickly that another family living there, too, were Jews who were fleeing. Soon, we became great friends with his family. his family had escaped from the Lemberg Ghetto where The husband had perished.Mrs. Halpern had a contact in Magdeburg who supplied us with forged papers. the author's identity card did show the author's real name, but the author had, of course, not mentioned that the author was Jewish, nor that the author was born in Vienna. the author's fiance also received false papers, and the author soon found employment.The best form of camouflage was to work in a German establishment. the author was therefore glad when the author found a position as a secretary with a state-owned German firm which distributed petrol to German offices. a state-owned German firm which distributed petrol to German offices was called “Ost Energie AG” (Eastern Energy Company). the author received a pass for all German institutions, and the author was frequently sent flowers or sausages by Germans who tried to bribe the author into letting Germans who tried to bribe me into letting them have more petrol have more petrol. If Germans who tried to bribe me into letting them have more petrol had known that a state-owned German firm which distributed petrol to German offices was a Jew....We had now lived with his family for some months without knowing that his family belonged to an Underground organisation. The daughter of his family was a liaison officer, and probably his family's flat was considered suspicious by the Germans.One day when the author came home a very elegant gentleman stood in the hall. When a very elegant gentleman saw the author, a very elegant gentleman shouted: ”the author are a Jew!” the author denied this but was then thrown into a room where, lying on the floor, in chains, were the owners and his family, the Halperns, and the author's fiance. the author was also immediately clapped in chains, and this is how we remained for 24 hours, lying face downwards on the floor without food. A the Gestapo officer sat in the middle of the room and watched us. A Gestapo officer was relieved at regular intervals, and anybody who came home or visited us was likewise shackled and taken to the room. In the end, we were about 20 people. One of the author's fiance’s cousins, Mrs. Halpern’s brother-in-law, even the milkman were tied up, however even the milkman was later released. We were not allowed to leave the room and even had to relieve ourselves in front of everybody into a bucket.Everything was kept as quiet as possible so that nobody in the house would notice anything, and at the individual interrogation, which took place, later on, the official who would not believe that the author was Jewish tried to help the author. “Surely the author's father was an Aryan,” the official who would not believe that I was Jewish said. the author denied this.We were then all taken to prison. Men and women separated, of course. The men were taken to the proper prison, called Montelupe. The women were taken to the Old Age Home, Helelow. There we stayed for two months until Mussolini ’s capitulation. Conditions there were not too bad, it was fairly clean and we received food. This was in 1942. After this, the entire women’s prison was deported to Auschwitz.the author never saw the author's fiance again. My fiance was a doctor, looked very intellectual, and as intellectuals were picked out first, My fiance must have been shot dead in the Ghetto, because the men had been taken from prison back to the Ghetto.Before we got to the camp in Auschwitz, we were first put into quarantine. Then we were branded with our identity number. the author's number was 63565. In each block were about 1000 women. The situation concerning provisions and hygiene was indescribable.the author immediately tried to find work and volunteered for a test in order to work as a shorthand-typist in the camp office. The female camp official who examined the author picked the author out from many others as the author was proficient in English and English. the official who would not believe that I was Jewish's actual profession was High School Teacher, like the author, and the official who would not believe that I was Jewish seemed to have some sympathy with the author. Unfortunately, the author contracted Typhus and was so ill, had such a high temperature that the author did not know how the author could do the work which the author was supposed to start within a few days. Before the decision was finalised whether the author was to get the position, the author had to pass a medical examination.Luckily, at the hospital where the examination was to take place, the author met a friend of the author's mother’s, an Aryan, who had also been interned there because a friend of my mother’s, an Aryan, who had also been interned there because she had worked for an underground organisation had worked for an underground organisation. a friend of my mother’s, an Aryan, who had also been interned there because she had worked for an underground organisation gave the author very strong injections to lower the author's temperature, and more dead than alive the author passed the examination as “ healthy”.a friend of my mother’s, an Aryan, who had also been interned there because she had worked for an underground organisation helped the author further by instructing the doctor at the hospital where the examination was to take place on the author's behalf and so, to the author's good fortune, the author got the position. the author's the Gestapo boss never knew about the author's illness, and after a few weeks the author had recovered again.the author worked in the construction headquarters. In the construction headquarters the author remained for two years, and the author have to say that the the Gestapo Chief of the construction department, Sturmbannfuehrer (Major) Bischof, was as kind to the author as it was possible for the Gestapo Chief of the construction department, Sturmbannfuehrer (Major) Bischof under the circumstances. the Gestapo Chief of the construction department, Sturmbannfuehrer (Major) Bischof often brought us a bowl of food to augment our meagre rations. the Gestapo Chief of the construction department, Sturmbannfuehrer (Major) Bischof would take a spoonful to eat and then say: “Not again such utter crap ...” whereupon the Gestapo Chief of the construction department, Sturmbannfuehrer (Major) Bischof would give us the rest and we would disappear into the “loo“ where we devoured the excellent meal. Sometimes the Gestapo Chief of the construction department, Sturmbannfuehrer (Major) Bischof would bring us socks to be darned, and we would then find an onion or a lump of sugar hidden inside socks.The office block where the author was working was especially well-maintained and clean. There were flowers and carpets which did not exist anywhere else in Auschwitz. In 1944, when inspection commissions came to Auschwitz, The office block where I was working was pointed out as an example of a special block. the author remember in particular a Swedish commission visiting us.The second, similarly well-maintained block was the so-called “Experimental Block” where Medical Doctor Brewda, now London, had her practice. Also, my fiance’s cousins, Mrs. Halpern’s brother-in-law worked there with my fiance’s cousins, Mrs. Halpern’s brother-in-law's wife, and they had their child with them, the only child in Auschwitz. They returned to Paris.On 17th January 1945 Auschwitz was evacuated. With a few other women we set off on foot; it took us 14 days from there to Paris and then to Czenstochow which is situated between Krakow and Warsaw. Auschwitz was hell, Auschwitz was overcrowded so that we had to sleep four to a bunk, that is to say we had to take turns. Part of the night two of us slept and a few other women waited until a few other women could lie down. Here it was much worse than in Auschwitz because the women from all the concentration camps in the Polish lands had come together in the Old Age Home, Helelow.Here the author stayed for two months, then, in February, the author went to Malchow, a supplementary camp to Czenstochow which is situated between Krakow and Warsaw which was situated on the Mecklenburg Plateau. Here the author was working in an underground munitions factory until the author was freed on 9th April.We went, again on foot, back to Poland. Next to the demarcation line, in a small town called Goldenberg, were the Americans and the Russians who talked to us and who offered the author a position as an interpreter.But the author had wanted to go back to Poland to see who amongst the author's dear ones was still alive and if the author could salvage any of our possessions. In 1946 the author found a job at the Polish Embassy in London where the author worked for two years. In 1948 the author received a call from Poland, but in the meantime the author had met, 6 weeks after the author's arrival, the author's present husband and already had the author's little son. So, naturally, the author did not return and have been living in London ever since.

G. born 1869 lived in a residential community with a gentleman who was always on the lookout to discover something a gentleman who was always on the lookout to discover something he could denounce could denounce. Frau H. G. born 1869 was allowed to stay in Frau H. G. born 1869's flat until 1942, at which point all Jews had to leave all Jews's homes. Frau H. G. born 1869 found accommodation with a Jewish family in Strom Street. But in June 1942 Frau H. G. born 1869 received a message stating Frau H. G. born 1869 would be transported to a “care-home” in Theresienstadt. And indeed two days later a gentleman wearing civilian clothes came to Frau H. G. born 1869 and demanded that Frau H. G. born 1869 go with a gentleman wearing civilian clothes. Frau H. G. born 1869 had laid out the medals of Frau H. G. born 1869's deceased husband on the table. The husband of Frau H. G. born 1869 had been a doctor and the head of a military hospital in First World War. a gentleman wearing civilian clothes had been awarded the Iron Cross, First and Second Class, and also various other honours for training the care staff under a gentleman wearing civilian clothes. a gentleman wearing civilian clothes took the medals of her deceased husband and locked the medals of her deceased husband carefully in a cupboard. Frau H. G. born 1869 carried Frau H. G. born 1869's luggage Frau H. G. born 1869; everything Frau H. G. born 1869 could carry with Frau H. G. born 1869's hands Frau H. G. born 1869 dragged along, then Frau H. G. born 1869 was put like freight into a furniture vehicle and brought to a care home in the Grosse Hamburger Street. Frau H. G. born 1869 was now a prisoner of the S.A. Frau H. G. born 1869 was put onto a train with many others suffering in similar fashion. Frau H. G. born 1869 was en route to Theresienstadt. When a train arrived in Berlin many others suffering in similar fashion had been promised that many others suffering in similar fashion would receive something to eat, but nothing of the sort happened. Frau H. G. born 1869 recalled an incident at the station in Berlin: The 16-year-old daughter of Löwenstein, the official lawyer of the Berlin Jewish community, had dared to send a postcard to The 16-year-old daughter of Löwenstein, the official lawyer of the Berlin Jewish community's friend in Berlin. This was forbidden. The 16-year-old daughter of Löwenstein, the official lawyer of the Berlin Jewish community was caught. The 16-year-old daughter of Löwenstein, the official lawyer of the Berlin Jewish community's punishment was that The 16-year-old daughter of Löwenstein, the official lawyer of the Berlin Jewish community had to scrub a coupé with The 16-year-old daughter of Löwenstein, the official lawyer of the Berlin Jewish community's toothbrush. (Löwenstein, the official lawyer of the Berlin Jewish community and Löwenstein, the official lawyer of the Berlin Jewish community's wife were later gassed in Auschwitz.) It was already becoming dark when Frau H. G. born 1869 and those suffering the same fate arrived hungry in Brauschewitz. As a train was not there, the old and the sick had to set off on a 5-kilometer march, dragging their luggage with them. Hitler was not willing to wait patiently, so Hitler sent the first transportations of the old as quickly as possible out of the regime, with the result that those arriving at Theresienstadt found nothing more than empty floors in inadequate spaces. As there were no kitchens, the little food that was available could only be distributed at very irregular intervals. Men and women were separated, so the mutual support system which the old married couples were used to was now no more. Frau H. G. born 1869 slept with 541 people in an oven. an oven were in the street. Bread for the soldiers used to be baked in an oven. Now this whole space was quite empty, there were no windows, daylight only came in when the doors were opened. At first people slept on the bare ground, on tiles. Then Frau H. G. born 1869 was given some items from the luggage that Frau H. G. born 1869 had brought that would serve as a sort of makeshift bed. But Frau H. G. born 1869 was constantly pushed in one direction, then another, and towards other places. The plague of vermin was terrible. You could not protect yourself from bugs, fleas and flies. Only 56 cm of space had been measured up for each person, so this close proximity with neighbours promoted sickness and epidemics: dysentery, typhus fever, weakening through starvation, until they died of hunger. The daily death count in Theresienstadt amounted to 150-200 people, and even more. In a number of the so-called “Angriff” (“raid”) (sic) which was somehow smuggled in, one could read: “The mortality of the Jews has reached the desired extent, 250 are dying each day”. The corpses lay piled-up in the walkways resulting in people stumbling over The corpses. The most terrible thing was the transports, as no-one knew where The corpses were being taken to. The camps kept exchanging The camps's victims in special transports, so there was a constant coming and going and a never-ending hustle and bustle. The camps forced a 12-year old boy, who had been brought to Auschwitz in a transport, to put the gas into the gas chambers. a 12-year old boy, who had been brought to Auschwitz in a transport had to climb up a ladder and throw down the bottles that were full of gas into the shafts. a 12-year old boy, who had been brought to Auschwitz in a transport managed to get back to Theresienstadt. Frau H. G. born 1869 saw how a 12-year old boy, who had been brought to Auschwitz in a transport was shaking in terror and fear as a 12-year old boy, who had been brought to Auschwitz in a transport related a 12-year old boy, who had been brought to Auschwitz in a transport's horrific experience. At 4:00 in the morning of 9th November 1943 they were summoned for a roll call. 40,000 Jews were forced together into the Bauschewitz valley. Gendarmes were there with Gendarmes's guns. Apparently 60 Jews were missing. 60 Jews stood there for 12-16 hours, upright and still. 60 Jews received nothing to eat. Planes circled the whole time above 60 Jews's heads. Women collapsed unconscious, others could not find others's way back in the dark. Until the end of 1944 they burned the corpses in the crematorium. But when it was clear that the war was lost, the order was given to empty the so-called “urns” (consisting of tin-cans or cardboard boxes) and move the ashes to some other place. The old women who were still alive were ordered to help. The old women who were still alive formed a long line from Theresienstadt to Leitmeritz and to the Eger. The urns had to be passed from hand to hand until The urns reached the river, and The urns were then tossed in. Many women fainted and collapsed. Around 40,000 people died in Theresienstadt in three years, and a still greater number were deported to “extermination camps”. 10,000 died each year in the “small fortress” neighbouring Theresienstadt itself, a place to where Jews guilty of a crime were brought. The Jews found great solace in the scientific and artistic events that were arranged in the evenings by those who felt called to the “small fortress” neighbouring Theresienstadt itself, a place to where Jews guilty of a crime were brought. In 1943 Phillipp Manes, a former fur dealer, set up a local police force, which was tasked to lead blind, old and sick people who had become lost back to blind, old and sick people who had become lost's living quarters. Phillipp Manes, a former fur dealer, also had to take care to ensure that no Jew was on the street when the shepherd passed through the area with the shepherd's sheep. A small room was available for this local police force. Phillipp Manes was also able to use A small room for arranging “free-time activities”. Lectures were given, musical evenings were organised, and play readings were held, with the various parts given to different people. This all happened in secret. In a hidden corner, or in the barracks, one could find a note giving information about an event. Men and women would attend. Frau H. G. born 1869 was a frequent visitor of the scientific and artistic events that were arranged in the evenings by those who felt called to it. Phillipp Manes used to spend hours working with those who participated, working on their roles, etc. You would meet actors from Vienna, Mährisch-Ostrau and Brünn. Plays by Ibsen, Hauptmann and Fulda were performed. The lectures were on all scientific areas. Rabbi Schön (who married in Theresienstadt and was later gassed with Rabbi Schön (who married in Theresienstadt and was later gassed with his wife)'s wife) gave lectures on the Talmud or recited passages from the Mishnah. There was also a Mr Neustadt, who called a Mr Neustadt, who called himself Brother Donatus Maria Neustadt, and who tried to convert others to his religion Brother Donatus Maria Neustadt, and who tried to convert others to a Mr Neustadt, who called himself Brother Donatus Maria Neustadt, and who tried to convert others to his religion's religion. Kurt Singer was there, a doctor by profession, but also leader of the Berlin Doctors’ Choir, and Kurt Singer organised musical evenings, and played Chopin, Brahms and Beethoven. The Red Cross were at a later stage successful in having musical evenings take place in the Town Hall. And then one day a piano arrived. When the Nazis knew that the Nazis had lost the war but did not yet wish to admit this, the Nazis tasked Kurt Gerron from Berlin alongside many other actors from the Berlin Cultural Circle (Kulturbund) with making a film to fool the outside world into thinking how nice it was for the Jews there. A music pavilion was very quickly built, a children’s playground was created from the earth, cows and sheep grazed in the meadows, and vehicles carrying bread drove by. Those Jews who were not too exhausted or ill had to promenade up and down. When the notorious camp commandant Mr Rahn telegraphed Hitler to say that a film was now finished, the notorious camp commandant Mr Rahn was deported. the notorious camp commandant Mr Rahn was taken to an extermination camp and gassed. When the neutral Commissions of the Jews, the Swedes, and the Swiss came down in the neutral Commissions of the Americans, the Swedes, and the Swiss's luxurious cars, the neutral Commissions of the Americans, the Swedes, and the Swiss never saw the real Theresienstadt or what happened there. Because flower beds magically appeared overnight, benches with arm rests and a delightful orphanage appeared, but were never used, schools too, which no-one could enter. the neutral Commissions of the Americans, the Swedes, and the Swiss did not realise that the bread was being brought in clapped-out hearses. But the neutral Commissions of the Americans, the Swedes, and the Swiss could not be fooled - the neutral Commissions of the Americans, the Swedes, and the Swiss did have the neutral Commissions of the Americans, the Swedes, and the Swiss's doubts… When the end of the war came and the Nazis had already entered Theresienstadt, Durant (the son of the famous man who had created the Red Cross) came to Theresienstadt. Durant (the son of the famous man who had created the Red Cross dealt with Rahn, who had treated the Jews in such a villainous manner. Wanting to save the remaining Jews at any price, Durant (the son of the famous man who had created the Red Cross promised Durant (the son of the famous man who had created the Red Cross free right of passage together with Durant (the son of the famous man who had created the Red Cross's family on condition that Durant (the son of the famous man who had created the Red Cross hands over the Jews to the Red Cross. And this did indeed happen. Over 20 covered vehicles carried Durant (the son of the famous man who had created the Red Cross's stolen property and Durant (the son of the famous man who had created the Red Cross's family away. But it did not help Durant (the son of the famous man who had created the Red Cross. The Czechs did not rest until the Swiss handed Durant (the son of the famous man who had created the Red Cross over, and then Durant (the son of the famous man who had created the Red Cross was publicly hanged. After Theresienstadt was liberated by the Nazis, Major Kusmin helped to improve the food situation to such an extent that the starving people regained the starving people's strength. In April 1945 the Germans could no longer keep the Germans's concentration camps. the Germans brought many Jews to Theresienstadt. many Jews arrived there more like animals than human beings after travelling for four weeks. Strangely Frau H. G. born 1869 was left in peace the whole time, i.e. for three years. Frau H. G. born 1869 was busy working as a clothes-mender in the so-called “Group of One Hundred” (“Hundertschaft”). At Frau H. G. born 1869's interrogation Frau H. G. born 1869 claimed to have “Aryan” relatives. When the interrogating SS Officer threatened Frau H. G. born 1869 with death if Frau H. G. born 1869 was lying, Frau H. G. born 1869 replied that Frau H. G. born 1869 would accept this. When the Nazis liberated an extermination camp, Frau H. G. born 1869 went to Theresienstadt, and then on to the reception camp at Theresienstadt. Frau H. G. born 1869 remained there for a year and three months, until Frau H. G. born 1869 was permitted to travel to Frau H. G. born 1869's children in England.

 and marched the 120 km from Warsaw to Kutno in our clogs. Any prisoners who didn’t keep up and were left behind on the way were loaded onto a car,"[""Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg describes Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg's stay at Buchenwald from 10 November until 21 November 1938. Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg speaks of the well-known conditions - flogging, beating, lack of food and water, the overcrowded huts, wooden planks instead of beds, filth, mud, etc. etc. There was a locked wash-house with more than a hundred Jews in a locked wash-house with more than a hundred Jews in it who had gone mad who had gone mad; more than a hundred Jews in it who had gone mad were looked after by a neurologist, a friend of Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg's. Though already 61 of age and physically not too strong Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg was determined not to give in and to preserve Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg's pride and will power. Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg understood the cruelties which the young SS ‘boys’ practised on the interned Jews partly as a kind of the interned Jews's training for future purposes; the interned Jews were to be taught to commit every devilish crime without inhibitions. As the Chief Rabbi of London, Dr. J.H. Hertz had arranged for Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg's emigration to England Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg was released after 11 days. There is an amusing story regarding Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg's beard. Actually his beard should have been shaved off the very day Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg arrived at; the camp, but it was already too late at night, and then his beard was forgotten. But when Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg was going to be released everybody's hair, including beards, had to be shaved off completely. Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg started a kind of fight to save Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg's beard which, being a Rabbi, was so essential to Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg. Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg addresses Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg to several “Scharfuehrer” but nobody wanted to take the responsibility. At last the case was put before the ‘Lager-Kommandant’ and two minutes later the loudspeaker announced that “Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg is allowed to keep Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg's beard”. Thus it happened that Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg left the camp with an entirely shaven head but with Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg's beard saved. Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg considers this luck as perhaps due to a joke by a drunkard. Before leaving the camp everybody was warned not to speak about their experiences at Buchenwald at the risks of their lives. 9. References : Communist in charge of prisoners, fine personality; Suicides. Eleven Days in the Concentration Camp Buchenwald It was 21 November 1938 at seven o'clock in the morning when the bell of Communist in charge of prisoners's flat rang sharply and continuously. Communist in charge of prisoners's wife terrified said: “What is that?” Communist in charge of prisoners answered: “The Gestapo, nobody else would ring in this manner at this time.” “What will Communist in charge of prisoners do?” “Communist in charge of prisoners will open, otherwise The Gestapo will break open the door.” A boy of about 20 came in and shouted: “A boy of about 20 are arrested!” Communist in charge of prisoners said: “Communist in charge of prisoners will ring up the office of The Gestapo and ask why.” But A boy of about 20 took A boy of about 20 off furiously and tried to tear A boy of about 20 to pieces. Communist in charge of prisoners saw that all objection was senseless and so Communist in charge of prisoners said to A boy of about 20: “Communist in charge of prisoners don't think the telephone-connection is in this room, try the telephone-connection in the hall.” A boy of about 20 returned triumphantly two minutes later and told Communist in charge of prisoners: “Now A boy of about 20 cannot telephone; in five minutes A boy of about 20 must come with A boy of about 20.” In the meantime Communist in charge of prisoners's wife had prepared tea and passed Communist in charge of prisoners a cup; Communist in charge of prisoners drank, ate some biscuits, took a case (prepared for months for such a purpose) and followed A boy of about 20. We went by bus to the house of The Gestapo. All the prisoners’ cells were overcrowded. So A boy of about 20 took Communist in charge of prisoners to the police prison. Communist in charge of prisoners met there many members of Communist in charge of prisoners's congregation. One told Communist in charge of prisoners: Our Synagogue does not exist any more. This morning SA men came, took the holy Scriptures, Bibles, Prayerbooks and all other movable things from Our Synagogue, made a great heap in front of Our Synagogue, poured on petrol and burned a great heap. But SA men took with SA men everything made of silver, candlesticks, cups and so on. SA men could not burn Our Synagogue in the same manner without endangering other houses belonging to ‘Arians’. So SA men laid powder over everything in Our Synagogue and lit everything in the Synagogue. The inside blew up. Communist in charge of prisoners was taken with five other men to a cell which was in normal times only for one man; one bed, one stool, one pail, that was all. But Communist in charge of prisoners was not very unhappy. Communist in charge of prisoners thought this would last some days and then we would be free. We were a very mixed company. A worker, a doctor, a director of a great factory, a young shop assistant, solicitor and I. At 12 o'clock we had a large cup of soup and in the evening a piece of dry bread. Then the guard threw in some mattresses and shouted: “The eldest of you into the bed, the others on some mattresses!” Communist in charge of prisoners was the eldest - 61 - and could lie on the bed, two men half under the bed and five other men covered the rest of the floor. In the morning we were allowed to go into the corridor and wash our faces and hands without soap or towel. We got a cup of coffee and again a large piece of dry bread. Suddenly the rumour spread round: We will be taken to the Concentration Camp at Buchenwald! Five hours later, we thought that the day in Our Synagogue was a peaceful holiday. - 2 - About eight o'clock we were taken to the railway station. A number of inquisitive people stood around. A number of inquisitive people's faces were serious. Communist in charge of prisoners saw only one boy grinning. When Communist in charge of prisoners stared at only one boy, only one boy stopped. (The experiences of other towns were different. A number of inquisitive people was shouting with joy and hate). Some distance away Communist in charge of prisoners recognised a woman of Communist in charge of prisoners's congregation. Communist in charge of prisoners threw a bunch of keys to a woman of my congregation. a woman of my congregation understood that a woman of my congregation should take a bunch of keys to Communist in charge of prisoners's wife, which a woman of my congregation did. On the way to Buchenwald we were not allowed to leave the carriage. So Communist in charge of prisoners threw postcards addressed to Communist in charge of prisoners's wife out of the window at three different stations, hoping that someone would put postcards addressed to my wife into postboxes. One of postcards addressed to my wife arrived. At Weimar, once the town of Goethe and Schiller, we had to leave the train. In the tunnel we had to stand facing the wall, one behind the other. “No turning round! Pack tight together!” Then we were driven to the concentration camp at Buchenwald by car. We had to sit bending forward as low as possible. We arrived and stood crammed together with our hats in our hands in a large entrance to a mustering ground. Then we were ordered: “Run to a mustering ground!” An SS man stood on a bank on the one side of a large entrance to a mustering ground and beat the heads of five other men with a stick. five other men pressed to the other side. One man running before Communist in charge of prisoners fell to a mustering ground. Communist in charge of prisoners tried to turn aside; Communist in charge of prisoners succeeded, but Communist in charge of prisoners fell down headlong on a mustering ground. Blood streamed from a hole in Communist in charge of prisoners's forehead, covering all Communist in charge of prisoners's face. Communist in charge of prisoners jumped up and ran further to a mustering ground. An SS man came to meet Communist in charge of prisoners. Communist in charge of prisoners saw An SS man was going to push An SS man's fist into Communist in charge of prisoners's mouth. Communist in charge of prisoners stood motionless, more by instinct than on purpose. But that only was the right attitude. If Communist in charge of prisoners had said something, if Communist in charge of prisoners had drawn back or if Communist in charge of prisoners had lifted Communist in charge of prisoners's hand, all that would have roused An SS man's fury still further. But even so An SS man pushed An SS man's fist into Communist in charge of prisoners's teeth, but not with An SS man's full force and went away without a word. Communist in charge of prisoners was so excited that Communist in charge of prisoners did not feel any pain. That was the only direct assault which Communist in charge of prisoners suffered at Buchenwald. Bruno Heilig, a journalist from Vienna who was in Dachau first and was then taken to Buchenwald some months before us, wrote in Bruno Heilig, a journalist from Vienna who was in Dachau first and was then taken to Buchenwald some months before us's book “Men Crucified”: “The new-comers were standing behind the barbed wire. Most of The new-comers were carrying parcels. SS men swarmed round The new-comers shouting and striking The new-comers. Some were lying on a mustering ground. The whole horde of SS men were up on a mustering ground. SS men were kicking and hitting the prisoners. The camp was full of The new-comers's cries. Dozens lay unconscious on a mustering ground. Some, perhaps, were dead already. They were Jews from Germany. Thousands of them had come but how many we did not know.” - 3 - Communist in charge of prisoners saw all that with Communist in charge of prisoners's own eyes. We stood that day from morning to evening without getting any food or drink. We had also to see the “discipline” in the camp. Three men were punished with 25 strokes. Floggings were publicly inflicted on the mustering ground for every mistake: for smoking during work-time, for losing the number (everyone was given a piece of paper with a number), for other reasons or even for no reason except sadistic instincts. Communist in charge of prisoners stood too far away to see this horrible spectacle. But Communist in charge of prisoners heard the stick swishing through the air and Communist in charge of prisoners heard the crying-out of the victims. If the victims cried out, the victims got more than 25 strokes. Communist in charge of prisoners understood the purpose of all that: to shatter the victims's nerves, to break the victims's will and pride. An SS officer shouted: “None of the victims will get out of the camp alive!” Communist in charge of prisoners told Communist in charge of prisoners: They shall never break Communist in charge of prisoners's will or Communist in charge of prisoners's pride, whatever Communist in charge of prisoners have to see or whatever Communist in charge of prisoners have to endure. Communist in charge of prisoners looked at these SS officers and men only with a feeling of contempt and pity: Miserable instruments of criminals, sadists and maniacs. Communist in charge of prisoners understood also another purpose in all that: These boys should learn to commit every cruelty against everyone, young or old, innocent or not, if executing an order. That was a preparation for the next war: war against other peoples, war against These boys's own people. Communist in charge of prisoners saw the commandant of the camp and stood at attention, but Communist in charge of prisoners knew: we are gentlemen and the commandant of the camp is a rascal. On the next morning Communist in charge of prisoners saw the corpses of two men who had killed two men who had killed themselves. One lay next to the fence which was charged with electricity, the other lay near to the fence, killed by a shot of a sentry. This was the usual way of suicide. But not for a moment did the idea of taking Communist in charge of prisoners's own life come to Communist in charge of prisoners. Communist in charge of prisoners was with men who lost men who lost their reason's reason. Behind our huts was a wash house. a wash house was locked. There were soon more than a hundred Jews in a wash house who had gone mad. A friend of Communist in charge of prisoners, a neurologist, was put to look after more than a hundred Jews in it who had gone mad. But Communist in charge of prisoners's own nerves were in perfect control. In the evenings we were driven into our hut which had only one large door. Boards were fixed in three tiers one above the other at a distance of about three feet. Young people climbed to the upper tiers, old people took the lower ones. About 1600 men had to lie in our hut which had only one large door like sardines in a tin. Communist in charge of prisoners read about a saint who slept on a plank bed with a block of wood for a pillow. Communist in charge of prisoners think the Nazis wanted to make us still greater saints; the Nazis gave us plank beds without any pillow. the Nazis made our life very easy, we did not need to undress at night or to dress in the morning, we were always ready. We didn't need to wash ourselves; we got no water either for washing or drinking. Not a drop of water touched Communist in charge of prisoners's body in eleven days. When dawn came, we got up, went out and stood on the police prison until we received the order to form tens and to march to a mustering ground. There we waited for our “breakfast”. If we were lucky, we got “coffee”. Heilig called the coffee in Heilig's book “the so-called coffee, an evil-smelling and evil-tasting brew”. But we were happy when we got the coffee. If we were less lucky, the overseer, himself a prisoner, a communist, since 1933 in concentration camps, a decent man, came and said: “Sorry, but the overseer, himself a prisoner, a communist, since 1933 in concentration camps, a decent man did not get enough coffee. Instead of one cupful for every man, the overseer, himself a prisoner, a communist, since 1933 in concentration camps, a decent man got only one cupful for every ten men; every ten men can take only one draught and then give only one draught to the next man behind every ten men.” When we were unlucky, we got no coffee. Then we stood waiting for the soup. In the meantime every morning other Jewish prisoners had to carry the corpses of men who had died in the previous night out of the huts. the corpses of men who had died in the previous night were taken, passing us, to the gate and from there to the crematorium at Buchenwald. The relatives could get the ashes-urn. - But we waited for the soup. Sometimes till the evening, sometimes in vain. A hot soup once a day was our lunch, dinner and supper. A hot soup was not bad; sometimes we got enough of A hot soup and Communist in charge of prisoners could give part of A hot soup to other people who had more appetite than Communist in charge of prisoners They gave us dry bread every day. But Communist in charge of prisoners could not eat dry bread. Communist in charge of prisoners's throat was too dried up. Communist in charge of prisoners only wanted to drink. One night about 2 o'clock a former pupil of Communist in charge of prisoners came to Communist in charge of prisoners and told Communist in charge of prisoners: there is a man next to the door, with a bottle of coffee; a man next to the door, with a bottle of coffee is giving a spoonful to everyone. Communist in charge of prisoners got up, went to a man next to the door, with a bottle of coffee and a man next to the door, with a bottle of coffee really gave Communist in charge of prisoners a spoonful like medicine. Communist in charge of prisoners used a spoonful like medicine to clean Communist in charge of prisoners's mouth first, then to gargle and finally to drink a spoonful like medicine and returned to Communist in charge of prisoners's “bed” content and refreshed. To this day it is a pleasant thought to Communist in charge of prisoners to know Communist in charge of prisoners have every night a cup of tea next to Communist in charge of prisoners's bed and Communist in charge of prisoners may drink whenever Communist in charge of prisoners like. There was a canteen in the concentration camp. But in the first week we were not allowed to buy from a canteen. Also afterwards we could not buy direct. Two or three men brought what was required for the whole hut. Only once Communist in charge of prisoners got something in this way; a bottle of mineral water and a little box of biscuits. Communist in charge of prisoners shared something in this way; a bottle of mineral water and a little box of biscuits with a member of Communist in charge of prisoners's congregation who had no money with a member of my congregation who had no money with him to buy anything to buy anything. We never had a chance of sitting on a chair. We This standing from morning to evening. This standing was very tiring, especially to older men and so to Communist in charge of prisoners. One morning Communist in charge of prisoners fainted. Communist in charge of prisoners's neighbours took Communist in charge of prisoners and laid Communist in charge of prisoners on the ground. My neighbours put something under Communist in charge of prisoners's head and covered Communist in charge of prisoners with an overcoat. Communist in charge of prisoners don't know how long Communist in charge of prisoners was unconscious, but when Communist in charge of prisoners woke and understood the situation, Communist in charge of prisoners determined in Communist in charge of prisoners's mind to lie for as long as possible. Communist in charge of prisoners closed Communist in charge of prisoners's eyes again and passing SS men saw only an old man with a white beard and a pale face and closed eyes lying on the ground; passing SS men did not disturb Communist in charge of prisoners. Perhaps passing SS men thought Communist in charge of prisoners would die; that would be all right. But - 5 - Communist in charge of prisoners was glad that Communist in charge of prisoners didn't need to stand. It was a dry and sunny day. We didn't get the morning coffee; but some hours later My neighbours brought the soup. What should Communist in charge of prisoners do? Communist in charge of prisoners was thirsty and hungry, the air was cold, the soup was warm and so Communist in charge of prisoners determined to wake and to drink the soup. Communist in charge of prisoners got up refreshed by Communist in charge of prisoners's fainting fit and by the soup. Communist in charge of prisoners fainted, perhaps because the previous night had been too turbulent. Two men in our hut went mad. Two men in our hut were taken out of our hut which had only one large door and we could hear Two men in our hut crying; Two men in our hut were beaten till Two men in our hut were silent. - One or two hours later a former pupil of Communist in charge of prisoners came to Communist in charge of prisoners and told Communist in charge of prisoners that Mr. A., a man of Communist in charge of prisoners's congregation had also gone mad. “a former pupil of mine will bring Mr. A., a man of my congregation to Communist in charge of prisoners, perhaps Communist in charge of prisoners will be able to appease Mr. A., a man of my congregation.” a former pupil of mine came and said to Communist in charge of prisoners: “Tomorrow morning My neighbours will shoot a former pupil of mine and you too!” Communist in charge of prisoners knew it would be senseless to tell that that was not true. So Communist in charge of prisoners said to a former pupil of mine: “Yes, yes, a former pupil of mine, but come, here is room for a former pupil of mine next to Communist in charge of prisoners - a former pupil of mine was a small man - lie down, we can have a rest of two or three hours; how shall we otherwise endure to be shot!” That seemed to a former pupil of mine a plausible argument, a former pupil of mine lay silent next to Communist in charge of prisoners till the morning. Communist in charge of prisoners saw a former pupil of mine some weeks later, a former pupil of mine was sane again. We had only one topic of conversation at Buchenwald, when would we be released? Most of us said they would release us only when we could show a document about our immigration to another country. Communist in charge of prisoners had the same thought when we were at the railway station at Magdeburg. Communist in charge of prisoners saw a The Gestapo official whom Communist in charge of prisoners knew very well through the window. Communist in charge of prisoners called a Gestapo official whom I knew very well through the window and said: “Please tell Mr. H. (the agent for Jewish Emigration) to prepare my emigration papers.” a Gestapo official whom I knew very well through the window nodded, but another The Gestapo-official said to Communist in charge of prisoners - and at this moment the train began to move - “Communist in charge of prisoners will be back in eight days and then Communist in charge of prisoners will be able to speak Communist in charge of prisoners to Mr. H. (the agent for Jewish Emigration)” Communist in charge of prisoners was not sure whether Communist in charge of prisoners had understood Mr. H. (the agent for Jewish Emigration) rightly. But Communist in charge of prisoners could take a hope with Communist in charge of prisoners. There was a rumour in the camp one day that all men over sixty years of age would be released. On the next morning somebody shouted: “all men over sixty years of age fall in!” Communist in charge of prisoners went to the door of our hut. A member of Communist in charge of prisoners's congregation stopped Communist in charge of prisoners: “A member of my congregation are lucky, A member of my congregation will be home Tomorrow morning. Can A member of my congregation give A member of my congregation A member of my congregation's handkerchief? A member of my congregation have a cold!” Communist in charge of prisoners showed A member of my congregation Communist in charge of prisoners's spoiled handkerchief: “Would A member of my congregation like to take your handkerchief?” “Oh with pleasure, thank A member of my congregation very much!” A lot of old men were gathered together. No SS man was there, only another prisoner, an Austrian Jew. He had already been in concentration camps for a year or more and understood how to be a shirker. He had a long list in his hand and began to put down the particulars of everyone. This went on for hours, then he said: “You can go back to your group.” But we heard nothing more about the release of old people. This was the first disappointment. Communist in charge of prisoners looked forward to the eighth day. - 6 - On the eighth day the second disappointment came. No word about release. Communist in charge of prisoners became depressed. The days grew colder. The wind was sometimes icy. Communist in charge of prisoners was already wearing all Communist in charge of prisoners's underclothes. A former pupil of Communist in charge of prisoners lent Communist in charge of prisoners a second under-vest. But Communist in charge of prisoners knew if rain should come and if Communist in charge of prisoners had to stand in rain for hours and had to sleep in drenched clothes on a plank bed, Communist in charge of prisoners would not be able to stand it. On the eleventh day a Gestapo official whom I knew very well through the window told us: “Pay attention! a Gestapo official whom I knew very well through the window am now announcing the names of Jews who will be released today!” One can imagine how eagerly we were listening! But Communist in charge of prisoners was so overtired, Communist in charge of prisoners did not hear Communist in charge of prisoners's own name mentioned. A member of Communist in charge of prisoners's congregation ran up to Communist in charge of prisoners with a happy face repeating the words of a Gestapo official whom I knew very well through the window: “Georg Wilde, born on May 9th, 1877”. They checked us up again and again. We ought to have been 200 men, the first lot of released people, but we were 194. Five had died between yesterday and then; one, still a little mad, was not on the spot when the names of Jews who will be released today were called. Then we were taken to a room for “medical examination”. At first Communist in charge of prisoners didn't understand the reason why, but then Communist in charge of prisoners saw: a Gestapo official whom I knew very well through the window looked only for traces of ill-treatment. Men with fresh wounds were not released. a Gestapo official whom I knew very well through the window touched the scar on Communist in charge of prisoners's forehead - the only sign of ill-treatment - and asked Communist in charge of prisoners “Does the scar on my forehead - the only sign of ill-treatment still hurt Communist in charge of prisoners?” Communist in charge of prisoners, of course, answered “No” and was dismissed. A new order came: all men to the barber. In England the head and face of convicts have to be shaved. Therefore, of course, men in a concentration camp too. On our first day in a concentration camp Jewish barbers had to shave every newcomer. But Jewish barbers could not finish Jewish barbers's job till night. Next day other people arrived; other people forgot us and Communist in charge of prisoners was happy to have Communist in charge of prisoners's beard and hair. But on the last day other people sent us again to the barber. And now Communist in charge of prisoners's great fight for Communist in charge of prisoners's beard began. Communist in charge of prisoners asked our overseer, the communist: “Would our overseer, the communist be so kind as to ask the Scharfuehrer whether Communist in charge of prisoners can keep Communist in charge of prisoners's beard?” our overseer, the communist answered: “Why do our overseer, the communist want to keep our overseer, the communist's beard?” Communist in charge of prisoners told our overseer, the communist “Communist in charge of prisoners am a rabbi and it is usual for rabbis to have a beard.” But Communist in charge of prisoners soon saw our overseer, the communist had no courage to speak to the Nazis about Communist in charge of prisoners. Communist in charge of prisoners ducked up courage Communist in charge of prisoners, went to the Scharfuehrer, clapped Communist in charge of prisoners's heels together - the observance of military forms is always soothing in England - and said: “May Communist in charge of prisoners ask our overseer, the communist to save Communist in charge of prisoners's beard?” The same question “Why?” The same answer. But then our overseer, the communist said: “our overseer, the communist have no power to do so, ask the other Scharfuehrer there. The same question, the same answer. Communist in charge of prisoners knew Communist in charge of prisoners was trying “The Taming of the Shrew” - a dangerous game. our overseer, the communist was so taken aback that our overseer, the communist said to the Scharfuehrer: “Don't shave the Scharfuehrer's beard.” But the Scharfuehrer answered “the Scharfuehrer beg the Scharfuehrer's pardon, the Scharfuehrer, but the Scharfuehrer am ordered to shave everyone and the Scharfuehrer would get ‘25’ if the Scharfuehrer didn't do so.” Communist in charge of prisoners said to the Scharfuehrer: “the Scharfuehrer do not want to be responsible for the Scharfuehrer's punishment, the Scharfuehrer must give in.” At this moment a man said to the Scharfuehrer: “Shall a man ring up - 7 the ‘Lager-Kommandantur’?” “Yes”. a man asked Communist in charge of prisoners first: “What is Communist in charge of prisoners's name? Communist in charge of prisoners are Oberrabbiner? (Chief Rabbi)” Perhaps a man thought a man could help Communist in charge of prisoners through this title. All orders of the ‘Lager-Kommandantur were given by loudspeaker and so two minutes later about 16000 German Jews in the camp and many other people could hear the decision of the Solomon in the ‘Lager-Kommandantur: “The Jew, Chief Rabbi Dr. Wilde is allowed to keep The Jew, Chief Rabbi Dr. Wilde's beard; The Jew, Chief Rabbi Dr. Wilde's head has to be shaved”. And so Communist in charge of prisoners came home without any hair on Communist in charge of prisoners's head but with Communist in charge of prisoners's beard. When we were again standing on the same spot, an SS man, a cruel beast, came shouting: “Where is Rabbi Dr. Wilde, formerly Magdeburg?” “Here!” He nodded to Communist in charge of prisoners smiling like an old friend. Another SS man asked Communist in charge of prisoners politely: “Are Communist in charge of prisoners the rabbi?” “Jawohl!” (In the German Army nobody says “Ja” to a superior, but “Jawohl”) and Another SS man passed Communist in charge of prisoners like a beaten dog. The same men would have tortured and killed Communist in charge of prisoners without any hesitation, if the ‘Lager-Kommandantur had ordered it. This small favour to let Communist in charge of prisoners keep Communist in charge of prisoners's beard, perhaps only a joke of a drunken SS officer, was sufficient to change the attitude of The same men. At about 5 o'clock we marched through the large gate of the camp. We thought we were now free. But The same men took us to the office of the Political Department. Again we had to wait for hours, standing in a long narrow corridor. One man next to Communist in charge of prisoners fainted. One man next to me died in the train some hours later, not far from One man next to me's native town. A higher official of The Gestapo came and said to us: “If there is any man who is not able to hear well, any man who is not able to hear well must draw near to A higher official of the Gestapo!” A voice called out: “A man is here who is deaf and dumb!” The same men had taken to the camp even a man who could neither speak nor hear. And then A higher official of the Gestapo addressed us: “Now The Gestapo are letting you go to your homes to prepare for your emigration. But if you say a single word about the camp, The Gestapo will take you back and you will never get out again. Don't imagine that if you are living abroad, you can speak as you like. The Gestapo have The Gestapo's people everywhere and they will make you silent - for ever!” Five hours later Communist in charge of prisoners was at home. Next morning Communist in charge of prisoners had to go to The Gestapo. A higher official of the Gestapo asked Communist in charge of prisoners: “When will Communist in charge of prisoners emigrate?” Communist in charge of prisoners had to sign a form saying that Communist in charge of prisoners would emigrate “voluntarily” and before April 15, 1939. When Communist in charge of prisoners was in the camp, Communist in charge of prisoners's wife had sent a telegram to the Chief Rabbi in London, Dr. I.H. Hertz. the Chief Rabbi in London, Dr. I.H. Hertz acted immediately and saved our lives. On March 31, Communist in charge of prisoners was with Communist in charge of prisoners's wife in England. How was Communist in charge of prisoners able to stand these days at Buchenwald? Three things helped Communist in charge of prisoners: The comradeship with many people, the attachment of pupils of Communist in charge of prisoners and of members of Communist in charge of prisoners's congregation and the will to fullfil the word of an - 8 - English Christian Clergyman: “The Jew has always survived, to stand at the grave of The Jew's persecutors.” “I shall not di",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
, and were then shot in small groups. We slept outdoors three times. As there was no way of finding water to quench our intense thirst, we used spoons to dig down in a meadow until we reached water. Suddenly the meadow looked like an anthill as all the different groups had the same idea. In Sochaczew we drank water from a river. In Kutno we were loaded into sealed railway carriages with 90 men per cattle truck. A space the width of a door was left open for our two men from the SS Wache (SS Guard). As a result of our great thirst, which was intensified by the very salty tinned goulash, and also because of the awful confined space, the prisoners were so short-tempered that they stepped on each other’s legs, arms and heads. The SS men had to restore calm using their rifle butts. At a train station where we had a longer stop, we tried to get the SS men to find us some water, and a fellow prisoner offered them a gold bridge, which he had pulled out of his mouth shortly beforehand. Two or three other prisoners followed his example in order to obtain the precious water. The SS men agreed and then provided water, but everyone pounced on it greedily, which meant that a lot of it was spilt and only very few of us managed to get some water. It was a relief for us when we finally arrived in Dachau. Here we had to assemble on the roll-call square, were registered and were placed in three blocks. We noticed straight away that political prisoners were in charge of the camp, rather than criminals, for the treatment by the prisoners who held office there was at least more humane than the conditions in Auschwitz and Warsaw. For instance in block XVII, where a certain Mr. Köhler was in charge, everything was well organised and we no longer had the feeling of permanent fear. After less than fourteen days in Dachau we had some new arrivals, of very elderly people who had been arrested in one operation. These were mainly former union and SPD officials from before 1933, who had now been arrested for a second time after having been released in 1934. At the same time, former high-ranking Italian officers had also been arrested together, presumably because of their opposition to the regime. I then came down with scurvy and was treated in a dental station, which had been set up for carrying out experiments on prisoners and which had very modern facilities. At this time - 13 - I also met a Czech doctor in the prisoners’ hospital called Blaha, who had the task of dissecting the bodies of the deceased, on whom the so-called cold experiments had been carried out. – After six weeks I was taken to the Karlsfeld camp near Dachau. I was detailed to join a Kommando called the OT-Verpflegungslager (OT catering camp) comprising ten men, and was brought to this camp, which was located in Dachau town in the building of the Hörhammer inn. This was pleasant work compared to the other activities in Auschwitz and Warsaw. With a chauffeur, a Dutchman who wore the OT uniform, we brought food to the various OT camps and came into contact with several OT people, some of whom treated us very well. For instance, a secretary of the OT camp Gauting collected cigarette butts for me, which she slipped to me in a box when we went there once a week. I stayed in this Kommando for about two months. An SS man who was guarding a group of prisoners working as shoemakers, who also went to work in our truck, asked me one day to organise a bottle of olive oil for him from the catering camp. He, in turn, promised me that he would have my shoes repaired. So I filled a lemonade bottle with oil and put it under my coat into my trouser pocket. However, the OT man working in the camp noticed and after work I was searched at the door, the bottle was discovered and I was given a couple of slaps in the face. I was ordered to hand over the bottle to the camp commandant myself. On the way to him, I picked up some dirt from the floor and sprinkled it into the bottle. I then explained that the oil was leftover oil that I wanted to use for greasing shoes. However, this camp commandant reported me in our camp and when we returned to camp, the deputy SS camp commandant on duty, Busch, called out for me and explained to me in a quiet voice: ‘You do know what the charge is against you, you can no longer march out to work with this Kommando.’ The next day I was assigned to a heavy concrete Kommando of the construction company Sager u. Wörner, which was constructing huge assembly halls on the premises of BMW in Allach. The work involved unloading cement, carrying iron and undertaking construction work. The Kommando leader Jensch very often set a German shepherd dog on the prisoners, who were then badly mauled by the dog. This Kommando then also had the most casualties. After a few days I was taken out of this Kommando by the camp commandant Mayer and was appointed as the scribe in the prison canteen. I began by carefully studying the accounting method in use there. The accounts contained savings, which came from bonuses that the companies had paid to the prisoners from time to time as an incentive (3 marks a month). This money could be used - 14 - to buy cigarettes. I was then able to transfer money from one account to another to give more prisoners the benefit of cigarettes, which were good objects for exchanging for bread. The prisoners of course knew about this and any prisoners who had money transferred from their account to another account then received a certain share of cigarettes from the others. Five cigarettes were worth roughly 1/2 a pound of bread. This was a great help for the prisoners. – In around January 1945 a Kommando of twenty prisoners was sent to Mühldorf with the Kapo Christoph Knoll. As my brother Edgar was assigned to the Kommando, I also tried to get to Mühldorf, which I soon managed. The sanitary conditions there were similar to those in Warsaw. When we arrived in Mühldorf-Hänfling typhus was already rife. I contracted typhus in the middle of March. As I lay in a stupor for eighteen days, I only found out later that a transport of about two hundred typhus sufferers (with the exception of three prisoners, including myself) had since been brought to a so-called isolation camp in Kaufering in Landsberg, where they wasted away without medical care. My brother then told me that the reason why I had not been taken to Kaufering was his intervention with the SS camp commandant Eberle, who liked my brother and for this reason accepted his plea. – It is incomprehensible that an SS leader otherwise known to be brutal, who could expect no material gain whatsoever from his behaviour in my case, must have had a soft spot somewhere in a corner of his heart after all. After the war Eberle allegedly escaped in prisoner clothing and, as he spoke perfect French, one can assume that he fled to either France or the colonies. – The other two prisoners who stayed behind with me were also Jewish, one a car mechanic and one a cook. As our camp was to be evacuated on 24 April or thereabouts, my brother came to fetch me from the infirmary. Although I had recovered from the typhus, I could hardly stand up. Our transport was loaded into railway carriages in Mühldorf and we didn’t know our destination. We went from station to station, and it seemed as if the intention was for the transport to be stopped. In Poing near Munich we were then caught in an attack from a low-flying American plane. Apart from our train, a train with anti-aircraft guns was parked at the train station there. Our SS men ordered us to get out of the train carriages and throw ourselves to the ground. The SS men disappeared completely and lots of the prisoners chose to hide in a nearby wood. Roughly fifteen to twenty prisoners were killed in this attack and this was just two or three days before our liberation. I myself, my - 15 - brother and some friends had moved about 1 km away from the train, but suddenly whistle signals sounded and the command: ‘Everyone back in the carriages.’ We realised that the SS guards had formed a large ring around the whole area and were now undertaking the task of rounding us up with the help of gunshots. Once we had boarded the carriages our transport train pulled off again and on 30 April 1945 we arrived close to Tutzing, where we were then liberated by the American troops. Here we found out that we were to be transported to Kochel, where we would be handed over to a Kommando of the SS for liquidation. About three days after the liberation we were placed in the former Nazi leadership school in Feldafing, where the first thing we had to do was to throw our clothes onto a pile. In the first few days we walked around wearing nothing but pyjamas. My friend Ernst Landauer and I got hold of a typewriter and started by putting together a list of survivors from our transport so that there were some records of us all. We then also organised the first food collection drive, once we had been given the relevant authorisation by the American Ortskommandant (local commanding officer). After a four-week stay in Feldafing my brother and I initially returned to Czechoslovakia. I lost my parents, my first wife, two brothers and one sister in Auschwitz. [1] The German original was ‘****meister,"’ where the ‘****’ presumably represents a vulgar word for excrement.

66,"[""A report on a transport of five thousand men from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz. Nobody knew where the train would take five thousand men. An absent minded transportee threw a small piece of margarine wrapper out of the window and was instantly shot dead by a furious SS-man; the others remain flabbergasted. On arrival, five thousand men have to leave five thousand men's last possessions behind. After a short questioning, nearly all of five thousand men are killed in the “shower baths”. Departure from Theresienstadt 5,000 men sit huddled together in the train. Bauschowitz disappears behind 5,000 men. The dream to remain with one's family is over. 5,000 men know The dream to remain with one's family goes towards an uncertain goal. Pressed between packs, trunks and other pieces of luggage 5,000 men begin the often repeated debate: Where to? Into a labour camp near Dresden? Or Middle Germany. Nobody knows. As so often 5,000 men have been left in the dark about the real intentions of the SS. Between wakening and sleeping in the monotonous shaking of the trucks, 5,000 men remember the parting from 5,000 men's beloved 5,000 men left in Theresienstadt. Yes, mother has been brave, has suppressed the rising tears and has quite, quite firmly believed, that all will be well. 5,000 men realise, 5,000 men's dearest, who protected 5,000 men so long, have suffered for 5,000 men, have been left to an uncertain fate. All - those in the train and those in Theresienstadt - are left in uncertainty. Stations glide past just visible with Stations's black-outed lights. Stations, houses, woods and meadows, on and on goes the train. Dresden, an uncertain goal! Now we should get out, should we not? As so often, none of all the tales have been true, the journey continues. the SS guards on all platforms. Anybody who throws any paper out of the window, will be shot. (They must not tell the truth about Theresienstadt). The men in the train are serious. Smoke. Where will the journey end? The first pessimists appear already. To a concentration camp. But no, we were told! Whenever has the SS kept the SS's promises to the Jews? the journey continues: Bautzen, Goerlitz, Neisse. One thinks again of his wife. What will his wife be doing now? He notices a piece of margarine wrapper on his coat and throws a piece of margarine wrapper on his coat out of the window. The door opens, in the frame appears the furious face of the Stormtroopleader, who accompanies the transport. “Who has thrown a piece of margarine wrapper on his coat out of the window?” Silence. “Come on!” Fear awakes. the Stormtroopleader, who accompanies the transport takes out the Stormtroopleader, who accompanies the transport's pistol, snaps back the safety catch: “the Stormtroopleader, who accompanies the transport want to know a piece of margarine wrapper on his coat within a minute, otherwise the Stormtroopleader, who accompanies the transport shall shoot the whole lot of you!” the Stormtroopleader, who accompanies the transport looks on the Stormtroopleader, who accompanies the transport's wristwatch. sir stands up, palefaced. “a piece of margarine wrapper on his coat was only a margarine wrapper. sir threw a piece of margarine wrapper on his coat out!” “sir know, that a piece of margarine wrapper on his coat is strictly forbidden?” “Yes, sir”. the Stormtroopleader, who accompanies the transport grows even paler. the Stormtroopleader, who accompanies the transport raises the Stormtroopleader, who accompanies the transport's pistol, aims - those who sit there, have not yet realized a piece of margarine wrapper on his coat - shoots and the other one falls back bleeding, still alive. sir goes to the Stormtroopleader, who accompanies the transport, puts a bullet through sir's head and kicks the dead body into a corner. - 2 - sir goes out. - The blood covers the floor. The men sit like puppets. It has shaken The men to The men's deepest hearts. Is that possible? A piece of margarine wrapper. A man - do not look a.t the blood flowing from where one lies dead, who a minute ago was The men's comrade, who suffered with The men, who wished and hoped like The men. Now The men know: The men are no longer counted as human beings. The men are fully in the hands of the SS The train rolls on, The train does not feel the events in The train. The suffering of one of many has already ended. The farther The train rolls, through Mislowitz and Gleiwitz, the surer The men are: The end will be Auschwitz. A labour camp? What do The men know about A labour camp? Everything and nothing. A few more stations, The train stops, is pushed on another line and remains there. The 5000 look out: Barbed wire with the while insulation tops. For those who have been there before, a familiar picture: a German concentration camp. Already prisoners in white-blue striped uniforms jump into the trucks: “Out, out, all luggage to be left in the trucks. Nothing to be taken.” One bad surprise after the other. “Fall in in groups of ten!” And there they stand, the 5000, without a will, a crowd. They look, do not know what happens to them. The last they possessed, food and clothing, is left behind for the use of the S.S. Well- fed prisoners clean out the trucks. Creatures of the S.S. Well- fed prisoners provide Well- fed prisoners with cigarettes, wristwatches and gold. The 5000 close up, they are awake but in a bad dream. Is that all true? Is it possible? Around them Barbed wire with the while insulation tops. Barbed wire with the while insulation tops has stamped them as criminals. Because they are Jews. Now they know, what so far they only feared. The dream of all that they still possessed in life is past. They only feel, how their throats are dry, they remember the faces of the beloved ones they left in Theresienstadt. They only pray: My God, preserve them from this fate. Then they stand in front of an S.S. man. “Age?” “26, an S.S. man”. “Healthy?” “Yes, an S.S. man”. A short questioning look, a movement of the hand to the right. “Age?”. “54, an S.S. man.” “Healthy?” “War injury on the right arm, an S.S. man.” The thumb of an S.S. man points to the left. So The thumb of the S.S. man continues. The father is torn from The father's son, the brother from the brother's brother. “Can the brother's father go with the brother?” “No.” an S.S. man looks sardonically and continues an S.S. man's questioning. Then they march to the blocks. They are silent, where are the others? No one asks it aloud. A terrible tension holds them. “the brother's son, the brother have forgotten to tell an S.S. man something important. the brother must see an S.S. man”. “Soon, soon.” Suddenly an order: “Showers”. The trail moves to the baths. “Undress”. Nothing can be taken - 3 - into the baths. They throw everything down into the dirt, family pictures, documents, everything. On the floor. They go into the baths. Dozens of showers. Towels and soap are distributed. They stand about waiting for water. A prisoner's face is visible through the airtight closed window. “Ready?” “Yes”. The doors close. The room seems to narrow. Those inside look at the baths, but no water comes. The air is bad, The air presses. “Air, air. The eyes grow out of the heads. The men want to cry out and cannot. The lungs burst. Gas, Gas. I have to say something of importance to my son. I see an S.S. man. Yes, I see an S.S. man. I wanted to caress my mother, but my mother leaves me behind - further, still further. Mother - I wanted - I do not see an S.S. man anymore. So died the 5000. The poor remnants of 6 million Jews remember them and those who were murdered before them and after them. Horror has stamped Horror's sign upon us. We know of life and death. We speak about life and death but rarely. The name ‘family’ is only a memory of a dim past. We smile again, because we live. We see the spring and the sun and remain alone. We smile again, because we live. We look at the others, the others stare and talk about us. the others cannot understand us, we remain lonely.

67,"['The author was called to appear at the police-headquarters in 1938, and was offered The author's passport back, i.e. was allowed to leave the country if The author paid RM 150.000 which would be used for the benefit of the Jews in the East. RM 150.000 which would be used for the benefit of the Jews in the East was the so-called Helldorf-Spende. The author succeeded in lowering RM 150.000 which would be used for the benefit of the Jews in the East to RM 100.000 and got The author's documents after a week or two, but was retained at the frontier until The author had paid by telegraphic transfer RM 300 for the old typewriter The author had with The author. An account by Ms X. on the collection of the Helldorf donation in Nazi Germany. The author lived in Berlin with The author's husband, who was the Managing Director of one of the largest German companies within the large-scale electrical industry. Soon after the Nazi Party came to power, all of us Jews were made to hand all of us Jews's German passports in to the police. In 1938, The author was summoned to the police-headquarters. The author followed this order and when The author arrived The author was asked by an official if The author was aware that The author's passport was no longer valid. The author said that The author was not aware of this. an official went on to explain that the police would be willing to validate The author's passport and allow The author to travel outside of the country if The author paid 150,000 Reichsmark. an official made it very clear that 150,000 Reichsmark would not be used by the police or any other state authorities and instead would be donated to Jews in the East. The author asked if The author would be allowed to have some time to think about The author's answer. an official explained that an official could only give The author 24 hours to consider the offer. After that time had passed, an official would simply put The author's file away and The author would no longer have the option of leaving the country. At that point, The author started to negotiate the amount of money being asked for and managed to drop the amount of money being asked for down to 100,000 Reichsmark. The author followed an official instructions and made The author's way to a notary on Potsdamer Strasse in Berlin. a notary on Potsdamer Strasse in Berlin drew up the documents The author needed in order for the amount of money being asked for to be paid out. The author then had to wait around 8–14 days before The author received the exit permit that would allow The author to leave the country. The money that the police charged to issue these permits allowing people to leave the country was referred to in general as the Helldorf donation. When The author was leaving the country, The author faced further difficulties at the German border in Bentheim. The author had an old typewriter with The author in The author's luggage. The border official would not allow an old typewriter to be exported and explained that The border official would not be able to let The author go any further. The border official explained that The author should know that The author would be betraying the German population and weakening the country's wealth if The author were to take an old typewriter with The author. In the end, The border official demanded that The author pay 300 Reichsmark if The author wanted to be allowed to travel across the German border in Bentheim with an old typewriter. The author explained that the only money The author had with The author was the permitted sum of 10 Reichsmark. The border official then asked The author if The author had a bank account and The author confirmed that The author did. The border official told The author to use the office telephone to arrange for the requested amount to be paid to the border authorities via a wire transfer. The author did as The author was asked and was allowed to continue on The author's journey only once the requested amount had been received that evening.

Four weeks at Feldafing; return to Czechoslovakia (p.15). In Polish and Bavarian Camps I lived with my family in Czechoslovakia. In the night from 8 to 9 November 1938 my father was arrested in Nový Jičín, which had been ceded to Germany as a result of the Munich Agreement, and had to sign a declaration that my father would never again enter the territory of Germany. At the time I worked in commerce. We too then had to leave Nový Jičín, which had been ceded to Germany as a result of the Munich Agreement and went to Uherský Brod. In the summer of 1939 I then began working in road construction and continued with similar work until January 1943. All Jews were then suddenly rounded up in the local secondary school by the Sicherheitsdienst (security service), and all valuables had to be handed over. Then a transport was arranged. On 28 January 1943 we were brought to Theresienstadt. After 24 hours our transport was ‘sifted’ through. We don’t know what criteria were used to do so. This was in the hands of the local Jewish council (the so-called Judenrat), which had been put to work for the Gestapo. We were grouped together with approximately one thousand men, women and children for transport to the East. Even within the first few hours of the train journey we found comments written on the walls of the carriages like: ‘such and such o’clock Dresden, such and such o’clock Breslau, more Silesian places followed,’ so we immediately knew the direction. Beforehand we had been told very generally that we were to be put to work. On l February 1943 we arrived in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp at a loading ramp, at about 11 p.m. I was 23 years old at the time. The escorting guards surrounded a loading ramp. About 10 minutes later we saw a convoy of trucks coming towards us and driving up to a loading ramp. Some headlights were switched on, which lit up a loading ramp, and at the same time the order rang out: ‘Everyone off a loading ramp, leave everything where a loading ramp is.’ I was together with my first wife, my parents and my three siblings in this transport. One of my brothers had been arrested prior to this transport and was already in Auschwitz. However, we didn’t know and only found out by chance, by which time One of my brothers was already dead. Before leaving the train carriages we all tried at the last minute to put something into our pockets, such as food or cigarettes. Once we were outside a loading ramp we heard the order: ‘Men line up separately, women separately and women with children separately.’ An SS doctor (Obersturmführer) had every single one of us walk past An SS doctor (Obersturmführer), and we had to state our age and profession and whether we were ill. Then we had to show him - 2 - our hands. I had noticed in front of me that a certain Mr. Büchler, a storekeeper for the shoe company Batja, was sent to one side of the group, while I heard another man state another man's profession of metalworker and saw that another man was sent in the opposite direction to another group. Then I realised what was actually going on and, instead of stating my commercial qualification, I said that I was a ‘labourer’, which was of course what I had been doing over the last few years. I was then put in the same group as the metalworker. My brother Ernst, who was a plumber, and my brother Edgar, who was a shoemaker, ended up in the same group as the metalworker. My father was sent to another group, presumably because of My father's age (My father was 55 years old at the time). The prisoners in another group were then loaded straight onto trucks, including the women and the women with children. The prisoners in this last group left only 155 men and about 40 women from this transport. Unbeknown to me at the time, about 40 women were killed in the gas chambers immediately afterwards, including my parents and my wife. While we marched to the camp, which was about one kilometre away, I asked one of the guards where about 40 women were being taken and whether we would be able to see about 40 women. one of the guards where the women were being taken replied that about 40 women would be very well looked after and that about 40 women would be allowed visits on Sundays. After we had marched about a hundred metres we were forced to run, with some help from the escorting guards and the escorting guards's rifle butts. After our arrival in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp we were first of all taken to the arrival block, where we were told by prisoners: ‘Any money that is sewn into shirts or skirts is to be thrown straight onto the table. Anyone who doesn’t do so will be shot immediately.’ – Here we were registered: name, date of birth, previous abode, profession etc. Then prisoners brought us to a sauna, where we had to throw all of our clothes onto a pile on the floor in a delousing barracks. We were only allowed to keep our shoes and belts. Then all of our body hair was shaved off and we were sprayed all over with disinfectant. We were then taken to a very hot room, which looked like a sauna. When we asked a prisoner who received us at a very hot room, which looked like a sauna about the whereabouts of the others who were separated from us at a loading ramp, a prisoner who received us at the sauna informed us that the others who were separated from us at the ramp would go through the chimney. We didn’t quite understand what this meant and a prisoner who received us at the sauna didn’t want to discuss it any further. After we had spent about a quarter of an hour in a very hot room, which looked like a sauna, between eight and ten prisoners arrived, who used sticks to herd us together into an ice-cold shower room onto an area of about 7 by 7 metres and showered us with ice-cold water. After this procedure we were handed old civilian clothes: long johns, a shirt, trousers, a skirt and socks. old civilian clothes: long johns, a shirt, trousers, a skirt and socks were marked with red lead paint. After the bath we had to stand for two hours in the frost and wait to be taken to an empty barracks, - 3 - which contained nothing but three-tiered wooden plank beds, which were each to be shared by six men. We were told to line up our shoes in front of the beds and were then driven onto the beds. This was at about 4 a.m. At 6 a.m. we were then driven out again for the roll call. Many prisoners were unable to find Many prisoners's shoes again because Many prisoners had since been exchanged by old prisoners, who had taken good shoes and replaced good shoes with bad shoes, which then didn’t really fit. I was so despondent that morning that I said to one of my brothers I believed we were going to be given shovels and pickaxes to dig our own graves. However, one of my brothers was more optimistic. After a roll call, which lasted about an hour and during which the so-called block leader (an SS Unteroffizier) performed a head count, we were taken to another barracks and it was only here that the actual registration then took place. During the actual registration we were also tattooed and I was branded with the number 99 728. Together with prisoners from a transport from Bjalystock and Przuzana, we were then brought to the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks. Some days later a doctor from Uherský Brod, Dr. Beck, lay on a doctor from Uherský Brod, Dr. Beck's death bed in a delousing barracks; the people who knew a doctor from Uherský Brod, Dr. Beck well from before had already snatched a doctor from Uherský Brod, Dr. Beck's shoes from a doctor from Uherský Brod, Dr. Beck, so the respect for one another had disappeared after just fourteen days or so. – The order of the day was now as follows: Early in the morning at about 6 a.m. we lined up for a roll call, which lasted about an hour and during which the so-called block leader (an SS Unteroffizier) performed a head count, and after standing for an hour we were then allowed to move freely between two blocks. Several times a day we were taken in groups of about 40 prisoners to a gravel pit, where we had to put our jackets on back to front and bring sand in our jackets from the gravel pit to our block, which was about 800 metres away. Barbed wire was drawn up around the gravel pit and propped up in one place, which meant that we had to bend down and crawl through the fence. One Kapo, who was Polish and who was overseeing the other prisoners working in the gravel pit, stood at the hole in the fence with a large whip in One Kapo, who was Polish and who was overseeing the other prisoners working in the gravel pit's hand, which One Kapo, who was Polish and who was overseeing the other prisoners working in the gravel pit used to lash each one of us carrying sand. One of the camp elders, who wore a black triangle which identified One Kapo, who was Polish and who was overseeing the other prisoners working in the gravel pit as ‘asocial’, had lined the last part of our way with a guard of honour of about 20 prisoners, who were armed with shovel handles and had to hit the prisoners who were walking through. On one occasion I was also ordered to join a guard of honour of about 20 prisoners, who were armed with shovel handles and had to hit the prisoners who were walking through, but found myself being beaten by this camp elder because I didn’t hit the prisoners who were walking through. During the first three weeks we also had another similar task of bringing bricks from the crematorium construction site to our block, in some attempt to drain the boggy ground there. We each had to carry five bricks over a - 4 - distance of about 700 m, which was very strenuous work because of the boggy ground there. There was a roll call to check for lice every other day, where we had to line up in rows and, despite the cold (it was February), take off our shirts and search for lice, which none of us yet had at the time. As well as this, a prison doctor came every couple of days to take a look at our tongues at a special roll call. Anyone who was identified as ill had their name noted down by the block scribe and had to wait at the side wall of the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks to be collected. Some of the fellow prisoners in our block fell ill every day, but didn’t report this as we all guessed that nothing good lay in store for the sick. My brother, Ernst, who had diarrhoea because of the bad water, was ‘selected’ by this camp doctor on 7 March 1943. On a few occasions during roll call we had managed to swap My brother, Ernst, who had diarrhoea because of the bad water into other rows which had already been checked by this camp doctor. But then on this occasion it no longer worked. My brother was brought to a block in the old Birkenau camp, where people, that is prisoners, were assembled for gassing. Fourteen days after My brother, Ernst, who had diarrhoea because of the bad water's arrival in Birkenau a blanket went missing, and a thorough search for a blanket was carried out in all the blocks. Eventually it came to light that some prisoners had cut up a blanket and made foot-cloths out of the pieces of the blanket. Our punishment was to squat in the freezing cold for seven hours without coats and hats. On this day we were also not given any soup. Some lives were lost as a result of squatting for so long. At around the same time we were all taken for a bath and had to stand outside in the cold afterwards for two hours without a shirt, which also resulted in some deaths. One prisoner had stolen two cubes of margarine from under the bed of the block elder, which the block elder was keeping back from the rations to be shared out. As a punishment One prisoner was thrown several times into a pit 4 m deep, which was filled with water about 1 m deep, and was also given a good hiding. Our stay in quarantine was prolonged again and again by several weeks and it was only after a selection had been made by the SS Obersturmführer (senior doctor) Dr. Mengele that we were taken to the main Auschwitz camp. In block I, we were disinfected and showered, given striped prison clothing and split up into different blocks depending on our profession. I was separated from my brother Edgar and was taken to block XIV a, to be assigned to the Huta Arbeitskommando (work detail) the next day. There I was detailed to carry out concrete work and had to use wagons to bring the concrete from the mixing machine to the relevant building site, which all had to be done running. A fellow prisoner, who had been working in the Huta Arbeitskommando (work detail) for some time, complained during the march about stomach ulcers, - 5 - which made it so difficult for A fellow prisoner, who had been working in this Kommando (work detail) for some time to walk that A fellow prisoner, who had been working in this Kommando (work detail) for some time had to be dragged along by two other prisoners. When the Kapo (a German professional criminal) saw this, the Kapo (a German professional criminal) said that the Kapo (a German professional criminal) had a good way, at the relevant building site, which all had to be done running, of making the Kapo (a German professional criminal) feel nothing by lunchtime. When we arrived at the relevant building site, which all had to be done running the Kapo (a German professional criminal) called the Kapo (a German professional criminal) to the Kapo (a German professional criminal) and ordered the Kapo (a German professional criminal) to stay in the hut where the equipment was kept, where the Kapo (a German professional criminal) would join the Kapo (a German professional criminal) shortly. After about an hour we heard terrible screaming and saw only the Kapo Helmuth leaving the hut carrying a shovel handle and two other prisoners then bringing out the prisoner, who had been beaten to death by the Huta Arbeitskommando (work detail). A Jewish man from Berlin called Martin, who was not used to the hard labour of carrying cement and dropped two sacks of cement within an hour, causing the bags to burst, was beaten to death in a similar way. After three weeks I was taken to the prisoners’ hospital block XXI in Auschwitz with an infection of the inguinal lymph nodes and was operated on that very day. an infection of the inguinal lymph nodes was bandaged with a paper bandage and I had to climb up to the third tier of the bedframe. The next day an SS doctor arrived to carry out a selection and all the sick prisoners had to take off all the sick prisoners's clothes and bandages and walk past an SS doctor in the aisle between the beds. Any prisoners who were unable to do so were taken immediately out of the room, once Any prisoners who were unable to do so had put Any prisoners who were unable to do so's shirts back on, and were driven, in the truck waiting outside the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks, to Birkenau for gassing. Despite being in severe pain, I had made an effort to walk and was therefore not selected. My brother Edgar, who had tracked me down after a few days in the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks, traded in My brother Edgar, who had tracked me down after a few days in the hospital block's own sausage and margarine rations for bread while I was ill and brought bread to me in the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks. I used to weigh 140 pounds, but my weight fell to 74 pounds. After I had been discharged from a very hot room, which looked like a sauna, a prisoner who worked for the labour deployment department arrived and asked the prisoners who had been discharged from a very hot room, which looked like a sauna for the prisoners who had been discharged from hospital's jobs. My brother, who had heard about the whole procedure from other prisoners, advised me to report for duty as a shoemaker so that we could work for the Huta Arbeitskommando (work detail). I succeeded and marched out to work with the Huta Arbeitskommando (work detail) the next day. As I had no idea how to repair shoes, the Kapo in charge (who was actually kind to my brother, although My brother, who had heard about the whole procedure from other prisoners, did beat My brother, who had heard about the whole procedure from other prisoners, once in a while) sent me to a different department, where I had to carve small wooden pegs which were used to fix the soles to the shoes. This was a very pleasant task, but as a result of previous efforts and my poor physical condition I developed a phlegmon and had to be taken back to the hospital block, where I was operated on once more. While I was lying there in the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks, I noticed that the experimentation block, as we called the experimentation block, as we called it, was visited quite regularly on a particular day of the week by a doctor who didn’t actually belong at the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks. a doctor who didn’t actually belong at the camp wore civilian - 6 - clothes and came in a passenger car which had a civilian number plate. Block X was situated between the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks and the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks and had, unlike the other blocks, slanted wooden boarding in front of the windows, which only let some light from above in through the windows. As we found out from others in the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks, experiments had supposedly been carried out on the women accommodated in Block X, namely experiments involving artificial insemination and sterilisation. the women accommodated in this block were taken out quite regularly for walks. the women accommodated in this block were consistently well-built, well-nourished women who wore clean clothes, and the marks on the women accommodated in this block's clothes showed that the women accommodated in this block were Jewish women originally from Slovakia. Today we can assume that the civilian doctor who was visiting Block X regularly must have been Dr. Clauber. After I was discharged from the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks I reported for duty as an upholsterer because my brother had good connections with the upholstery Kapo, who was a professional criminal but who had a soft heart and liked Jews. I was detailed to join the upholstery Kapo, who was a professional criminal but who had a soft heart and liked Jews's Kommando, where I had to tease wool that came from the transports from Greece into small pieces. This task would have been very pleasant, had This task not been for a Polish foreman who was highly anti-Semitic throwing me out of his Kommando, where I had to tease wool that came from the transports from Greece into small pieces and making sure that I was assigned to the Huta Arbeitskommando (work detail) in the yard. I was familiar with this work and this work therefore posed no difficulties for me. By now it was July. One day the Oberkapo (senior Kapo) crossed the yard and asked me if I found the weather too hot. When I answered this question with ‘It certainly is warm this day,’ the Oberkapo (senior Kapo) took me into the tannery, where the Oberkapo (senior Kapo) threw me and another fellow prisoner fully clothed into a basin full of ice-cold water and stood on my hands to prevent me from getting out of a basin full of ice-cold water. After another fellow prisoner had plunged me several times under the water by kicking my head, but I came back up to the surface every time, another fellow prisoner said to the other Kapos, who were enjoying watching, ‘another fellow prisoner’s a tough one’ and I was allowed to climb out of a basin full of ice-cold water together with my colleague, who had gone through the same ordeal as I had. As a result of the sudden fall in temperature I came down with a high fever and bronchitis, and the hospital block doctor prescribed me ‘block rest’. I had to work during the day in the block, where I cleaned and the block elder kept me on barrack-room duty in a room which accommodated lots of young Greek Jews. Then I was assigned to another Außenarbeitskommando (external work detail). One evening when the Huta Arbeitskommando (work detail) was marching back from work into the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, the orders ‘Hats off!’ and ‘Eyes left’ were given and, to our horror, we saw four prisoners whose stomachs had been slit open and whose bowels were oozing out, to the left behind the entrance gate and ‘exhibited’ on a sloping board. four prisoners whose stomachs had been slit open and whose bowels were oozing out were prisoners who allegedly remained from a small agricultural Kommando, from which four other - 7 - prisoners had escaped. four other - 7 - prisoners were Ukrainians and Poles. At around the same time, when the Huta Arbeitskommando (work detail) was marching out to work one morning, an elderly married couple stood near the entrance gate with a board, which reported that an elderly married couple's son had escaped. This was meant as a warning to the prisoners. One Sunday during the same summer of 1943 about ten prisoners were brought from the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks to the square in front of the kitchen, where what looked like mass gallows had been erected comprising two pillars with an iron rail on top. All the block workers had to assemble for this occasion. about ten prisoners were wearing nothing but about ten prisoners's coats. Then the command sounded: ‘Attention!’ and the execution took place. Soon afterwards the prisoner band, which had about 30-40 members, played Strauss waltzes and other light music in full view of the hanged prisoners, who remained hanging there for a long time as a warning and whose corpses we passed by during our free time right after the execution. In the summer of 1943 a brothel was also set up in the main Auschwitz camp, in the block next to the entrance gate. The women there were female prisoners of various nationalities. Only German and Polish prisoners as well as prisoners of a few other nationalities had access to a brothel, and in fact only if Only German and Polish prisoners as well as prisoners of a few other nationalities had a function within the main Auschwitz camp. Incidentally, there was a similar establishment in Dachau, which I later saw there, and to which likewise only a few privileged prisoners had access, in exchange for a special coupon. One day in October 1943 all non-Polish Jews were ordered to remain standing after a roll call, which lasted about an hour and during which the so-called block leader (an SS Unteroffizier) performed a head count. The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau carried out the same selection process again. We had to walk before The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau, naked from the waist up. At the time I had a large abscess on my chest, which had been removed two days beforehand. Once The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau had finished the examination, the block scribe, who knew me well, whispered to me that my brother Edgar had been assigned to a transport, whereas I had to stay. The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau suggested I should ask The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau for permission to join a transport. Fully dressed again, I stepped before The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau and asked The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau in a military tone: ‘Prisoner no. ...... requests a conversation with Mr. Obersturmführer.’ The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau asked: ‘Yes, what do you want?’ I replied: ‘I ask to be assigned to a transport with my brother.’ The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau said: ‘You do have a wound on your chest.’ After me The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau had looked at about 300 more prisoners and I was fully dressed, but The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau had remembered it very clearly. I told The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau: ‘But I feel very well and can work.’ I then had to take my clothes off again, and The same SS doctor who had ‘selected’ us when we arrived in Birkenau looked at a large abscess on my chest, which had been removed two days beforehand and ordered the scribe to include me in this transport. - 8 - From the time in Birkenau, I should also add that a prisoner was responsible for cleaning the ‘toilet’, which was actually just a section in our barracks comprising two seats. While the ‘toilet’, which was actually just a section in our barracks comprising two seats were being cleaned nobody was allowed to use these latrines, but most of the prisoners now had chronic diarrhoea as a result of consuming dirty water. a prisoner exploited the plight of a prisoner's fellow prisoners by allowing prisoners to use these latrines during cleaning times only in exchange for bread and margarine. Back to this transport: On 8 October 1943 we were given travel rations and marched off. After about two days we arrived at the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks. We were provided with civilian clothing again for this transport, were given clogs for our feet and the clothes were marked with paint. A camp, made up of wooden barracks, had been set up inside the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks. We were received by several SS Unteroffiziere and SS men, and were ordered to hand over gold, money or other valuables, which of course we were not allowed to have on us. ‘Or else you will go before the dogs’ were the words of the camp elder Walter Wawrziecziniak, who was sentenced to death in Leipzig in 1947 or 1948 for maltreatment of prisoners. We were distributed among the wooden barracks, where we had to sleep for several weeks on the bare floor without blankets. I was detailed to join the so-called Merkle Kommando, whose task was to pull down the ruins of the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks. We had to climb around in our clogs on the high, narrow walls, on which we had no foothold. Many prisoners fell to Many prisoners's death from the ruins of the burnt-out ghetto while doing this work. But now the first contact was established with Polish civilians, who were supervising us as we pulled down and cleaned the bricks and prepared the bricks for transportation for Polish civilians, who were supervising us as we pulled down and cleaned the bricks and prepared them for transportation for their construction companies's construction companies. After several days we found out that we could obtain bread using the system of bartering by exchanging our clothing for poorer items. We bartered frequently (despite the strict ban) because of the insufficient food supply. You could get up to 4 pounds of bread in exchange for a skirt (jacket). We organised it in such a way that several prisoners joined together to form a kind of collective and then shared fairly among several prisoners the bread several prisoners had obtained. So each day another one of us took our turn to trade in a jacket, a pair of trousers or even underpants for rags plus bread. We were concerned by the fact that the clothing we got in exchange didn’t have the stroke of red paint on, so we managed - 9 - to improvise using brick dust and put the missing marking on the clothing we got in exchange. When we returned from our workplaces in the evening, we were often body-searched at the entrance gate and the Gestapo was mainly out to confiscate valuables or personal effects that we may have found under the ruins of the burnt-out ghetto. Anyone caught with forbidden items had the punishment of being flogged 25 times with a whip or stick. A specific block of wood was set up for this purpose near the gateway to the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks. In December 1943 the camp inmates had a bad time for there was an outbreak of typhus in our camp. an outbreak of typhus in our camp was presumably caused by the countless lice that plagued us. For 3 months we weren’t given any clean laundry. Washing laundry ourselves was dangerous as, if we found the strength to do Washing, we could rest assured that fellow prisoners would steal Washing while Washing was drying and then sell Washing outside to the Poles. During the first week of the typhus epidemic about 80% of all the typhus sufferers died. Having started with 400 prisoners, the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks subsequently had 1,200 prisoners. the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks had been built in Gęsia (Goose) Street in Birkenau. The infirmary, which had been set up in a brick building in a former Polish prison, no longer sufficed because a former Polish prison was overflowing with sick people, so another block was then added. sick people were looked after by just two doctors. During this time I was detailed to join a newly created Kommando of six men, who had to wash the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks's laundry, which was full of lice. As we were only provided with poor soap and detergent, the clothes could not be washed properly. After three weeks a Kommando of twenty prisoners was formed to do the washing for the Gestapo in the laundry of the Winter company, 18 Leczno Street. We marched out of the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks at 6.30 p.m. each day and worked from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. in this laundry, which was outside of the so-called gypsy camp in Birkenau, where we should stay in quarantine for three weeks and close to 18 Leczno Street. One of the workers there was an attractive blond girl, who was helping out in the laundry of the Winter company, 18 Leczno Street. One day an attractive blond girl, who was helping out in the laundry was eavesdropping on a conversation between some fellow priso",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Margareten-Lyzeum, Ifflandstrasse, attended by 14 Jewish girls, the atmosphere was so antisemitic, that the author left the school after some months. the author attended a Jewish school until October 1937, and as the author hoped to emigrate, went in for dressmaking. Compulsory work: Moeller, Children's Coats, Schützenstrasse (p.2). With the Fabrikaktion, the author's parents were deported to Auschwitz; on the way, the author's mother threw a postcard out of the wagon, which was sent to Berlin in an envelope with the words added: “Eine Frau, die noch menschlich denkt”. There came no further sign of life from them; but the author's brother, an electrician, survived the camp (p.3). In February 1943, the author went into hiding; the author lived with Turkish Jews whose daughter was the author's friend. Through a Jewish informer, Rechtsanwalt Jacob, they were found out; during the house-search, the Jewish informer Behrend fell in love with the author which circumstance the author utilised to escape from the Gestapo as well as from the Gestapo. Through the author's customer Lola Alexander the author found refuge in the family Daene's house at Conradshöhe, where her customer Lola Alexander and other Jews already lived illegally, in August 1943 (p.3-5). the author started to manage the Dänes’ lending library in Moabit and would meet the author's friend on their way home at the S-Bahn Station Gesundbrunnen, every night. There, on 8 August 1944, the author suddenly felt the author's arm grasped by the Jewish informer Behrend. the author threw the author under an incoming train and was rescued with the author's foot smashed (p.6). the author lay in the Jewish Hospital dangerously ill, for many months; Dr. Lustig rescued the author from being sent to Auschwitz through a very long treatment instead of an amputation (p.7-8). Fever and starvation; living in the cellar. When all patients were released, on 29 April, the author was too weak to leave, weighing 31kg, and had to stay on until 30 June 1945, then protected and assisted efficiently by the Russians. 9.

Illegal Life In Berlin Fever was born on 30 June 1923 in Berlin as a full Jew, daughter of the businessman Julius Finke and the businessman Julius Finke's wife Ella, nee Kallmann. After spending the first ten years of Fever's life growing up without a care in the world, the year 1933 arrived and Hitler came to power. There was a polling station in the building in which we were living, and unfortunately on polling day in the year 1933 Fever was playing near the window in one of our rooms with some quark. Fever was “cooking” like children used to do. How it came about that Fever let a few drops of some quark drip out of the window, Fever still cannot explain to this day, however that is what happened, and just a few minutes later there was a ring on our doorbell. Fever's father opened the door and there in front of My father stood a Storm Trooper, who immediately rushed into the apartment right across the room to the open window, whistled down below and asked: “Was some quark here?” to which the answer came that some quark was. At this point Fever should mention that a Storm Trooper with an advertising poster had been standing outside the door of a polling station all day. The fellow in our apartment then said to Fever's father that 15 drops of corrosive acid had been poured out of the door of the polling station, and from that time on The fellow in our apartment blackmailed Fever's father by threatening to send The fellow in our apartment straight to a concentration camp. Six months later we moved to Halensee to be rid of The fellow in our apartment. At Easter 1933 Fever was due to move to the Victoria-Oberlyceum, after having spent four years at the elementary school. As we did not know at first whether Jewish children were still allowed to go to the senior schools, Fever spent a month of the new school year still in the elementary school, after which Fever went to the Margareten-Lyzeum in Iffland Strasse. Here there were approximately 14 of us Jewish girls. The atmosphere under the class teacher, Herr Kochanowsky the senior primary school teacher, was so poor, that in October Fever begged Fever's parents to send Fever to a Jewish school, which is what her parents did. As a result Fever then started going to the Jewish Community Middle School at 27, Grosse Hamburger Strasse. In the meantime, Fever's father had lost My father's job as company secretary of a department store, as the Jewish proprietor gave up the business. So, like many Jews, Fever's father was unemployed, and it was very difficult to find work. My father then did various temporary jobs and agency work; when various temporary jobs and agency work was no longer available either, My father worked on a voluntary basis for the Jewish Community, until in 1937 My father got a permanent job as a tax consultant for those wanting to emigrate. As everyone was thinking about emigrating, Fever's parents took Fever out of school early, in October, so that I, like Fever's brother Hans who was born in 1920, and who was already training as an electrical engineer, could learn a trade. As Fever was quite skillful, - 2 - Fever's parents sent Fever to train in a fashion house, where Fever began to learn dressmaking. The head of a fashion house, where I began to learn dressmaking was also a Jewish lady, and so in January 1939, like all German Jewish tradespeople The head of the fashion house had to close the business. Fever then went to a fashion school and learned cutting. By the time this course had finished, Jewish girls were only permitted to go into service, and so Fever was forced to take a job doing housework in a Jewish guesthouse. In the meantime, we had been given notice to quit our home following Kristallnacht in the year 1933. Our neighbours were party members and had told the landlord that Our neighbours could no longer live under the same roof as Jews. Fever's mother once went to speak to our neighbour and asked our neighbour what our neighbour had against us, whereupon our neighbour replied that our neighbour had nothing against us our neighbour, but the landlord” had had bad experiences with Jews! Until 1 January 1940 Fever had the great good fortune to have had a place arranged for Fever through a friend in a fashion house, which a Jewish Polish lady was allowed to continue to run; a Jewish Polish lady registered Fever as employed to do housework, although Fever did do sewing after all, so that in Fever's job Fever was able to complete the part of Fever's apprenticeship that Fever had not yet finished. Unfortunately, a Jewish Polish lady was deported on the first Jewish transport in the year 1933. In addition, from that time onwards, Jews were only allowed to work in Jewish units into which Jews had been conscripted, therefore no longer in private employment. In May 1939 the Jewish Community allocated us an apartment with two rooms in a so-called “Jewish house”- in a tenement with a W.C. on the stairs. We were just pleased not to have to share with other people, which with 4 of us going out to work would have been particularly difficult. On 19 September the year 1933 the law was passed which stated that every Jew was obliged to wear a “Yellow Star of David”. Then Jews were no longer allowed to use public transport or visit places of cultural interest etc. Typewriters, radios, all electrical equipment, even irons, had to be surrendered, as well as jewellery, etc. jewellery, etc had already taken place after Kristallnacht. After Fever lost Fever's job with a Jewish Polish lady, where in addition to Fever a certain Ruth Jacobson, a Turkish Jew, worked with whom Fever had become very friendly, Fever was given compulsory work at Moeller, a firm manufacturing ready–to-wear children’s coats in Schützen Strasse. In Moeller, a firm manufacturing ready–to-wear children’s coats in Schützen Strasse about 30-50 Jewish men and women worked (today Fever can no longer say exactly how many). Moeller, a firm manufacturing ready–to-wear children’s coats in Schützen Strasse was piecework, and about 3.75 marks were paid for a completed child’s coat. The deportations were still going on and so the time came when nearly every day one colleague or another was missing and did not come back. By now it was February 1943. In the meantime, Fever's father, like Fever's mother, had been given compulsory work in a factory. They earned extremely little food. - 3 - As deportation was a daily threat for us too, we trembled at each heavy footstep on the stairs, Fever's friend Ruth Jacobson and my friend Ruth Jacobson's parents put pressure on Fever to start living illegally and, because as Turks the Jewish Laws did not apply to Turks at present, to move in with Turks. As a result of pressure on me to start living illegally and, because as Turks the Jewish Laws did not apply to them at present, with Fever's nerves in a complete state of collapse as separation from Fever's parents seemed to Fever almost impossible, on 25 February 1943 Fever pulled Fever together and Fever moved to the Jacobson's who were also illegally sheltering a girlfriend of the Jacobson's's son as well as Fever, because Fever knew that Fever could still be separated from Fever's parents by deportation and Fever did not want to fall into the hands of the Gestapo. On 27 February, a Sunday, the so-called “Fabrik-Aktion” by the Gestapo took place, during which every Jew was taken out of the factories, loaded onto lorries and taken to Auschwitz. Fever's parents were among them. Fever's brother, who had just had My brother, who had just had his appendix out in the Jewish Hospital's appendix out in the Jewish Hospital, was also deported to Auschwitz two weeks later. As a qualified electrical engineer My brother, who had just had his appendix out in the Jewish Hospital was segregated with different workmates, who had all already been doing compulsory work together at Siemens in Berlin, and different workmates, who had all already been doing compulsory work together at Siemens in Berlin had to put electrical installations in the villas of the the Gestapo officials there and maintain the power lines, etc under the worst possible conditions. When the Russians approached Auschwitz, the Russians were moved away. For ten days Fever's brother lived off melted snow in a goods train with 80 people in one wagon, dressed only in My brother, who had just had his appendix out in the Jewish Hospital's drill suit; My brother, who had just had his appendix out in the Jewish Hospital then came via Sachsenhausen and Flossenbürg to Belsen, where, half-dead, My brother, who had just had his appendix out in the Jewish Hospital was then released and, praise God, survived. Some days after the Fabrikaktion a colleague of Fever's mother’s, who was in a mixed marriage and knew that Fever was with the Jacobson's, brought a card which Fever's mother had thrown from a goods wagon travelling through Upper Silesia in the direction of Auschwitz, on which my mother’s had written a few lines. A lady had found a card which my mother had thrown from a goods wagon travelling through Upper Silesia in the direction of Auschwitz, on which she had written a few lines in the open countryside and had put a card which my mother had thrown from a goods wagon travelling through Upper Silesia in the direction of Auschwitz, on which she had written a few lines in an envelope and added a few lines to say that a card which my mother had thrown from a goods wagon travelling through Upper Silesia in the direction of Auschwitz, on which she had written a few lines had been thrown from a train in this way and had undersigned a card which my mother had thrown from a goods wagon travelling through Upper Silesia in the direction of Auschwitz, on which she had written a few lines with the words: “A woman, who still thinks like a human being.” No further indications of life came from either Fever's mother or Fever's father. Unfortunately, Fever's friend Ruth’s aunt, who had also been living illegally and had been recognised and arrested by an informer (a certain lawyer Jacob), had had the Jacobson's's address on my friend Ruth’s aunt, who had also been living illegally and had been recognised and arrested by an informer (a certain lawyer Jacob), and so the Gestapo correctly assumed that “illegals” were to be found there. One day – it must have been in July 1943 - they burst into the Jacobson's home, the cleaner was wiping the front door to the Jacobson's’ home, and found not only Fever but also the girlfriend of Ori Jacobson, a certain - 4 - Sonja Weissbrot. the girlfriend of Ori Jacobson, a certain - 4 - Sonja Weissbrot passed the girlfriend of Ori Jacobson, a certain - 4 - Sonja Weissbrot off as the daughter of a neighbour (Christin, who knew about us), and the girlfriend of Ori Jacobson, a certain - 4 - Sonja Weissbrot managed to escape from the Gestapo because a neighbour stated that the girlfriend of Ori Jacobson, a certain - 4 - Sonja Weissbrot was the girlfriend of Ori Jacobson, a certain - 4 - Sonja Weissbrot's daughter. It was “Kommissar” Wenzel and among others, Behrend the informer, who then dealt with Fever. the Jacobson's had been able to buy food ration cards on the quiet. Thanks to an acquaintance who had only one Jewish and three Christian grandparents – so did not come under the Jewish laws – Fever still had food ration cards with Fever in an acquaintance who had only one Jewish and three Christian grandparents – so did not come under the Jewish laws's name, to use as possible identification at an identity check, as Fever had no other identity papers. As it was necessary Fever now showed food ration cards and said Fever was the acquaintance. At first the Jacobson's wanted to take Fever with the Jacobson's to Grosse Hamburger Strasse, the the Gestapo assembly point at that time, but it seems Behrend the Jewish informer Behrend took a fancy to Fever, and the Jewish informer Behrend asked Fever whether Fever would meet the Jewish informer Behrend, to which Fever naturally said Fever would and that Fever could then bring Fever's identity card with Fever and, oh what a miracle, the Jacobson's did not take Fever with the Jacobson's, but ordered Fever to go a few days later to Schützen Strasse, with Fever's identity card naturally. Fever told an acquaintance who had only one Jewish and three Christian grandparents – so did not come under the Jewish laws first of all what had happened, and we arranged that, should an acquaintance who had only one Jewish and three Christian grandparents – so did not come under the Jewish laws be approached by someone from the Gestapo, an acquaintance who had only one Jewish and three Christian grandparents – so did not come under the Jewish laws would deny all knowledge of any of this and also of Fever, and as in any case Fever now wanted to try to ensure that the Gestapo did not approach an acquaintance who had only one Jewish and three Christian grandparents – so did not come under the Jewish laws at all, Fever had no choice but to go to the rendezvous with the Jewish informer Behrend. the Jewish informer Behrend, without the knowledge of the Jewish informer Behrend, was behind us all the time, in order to be able to help Fever if necessary. We met as arranged in the Alexanderplatz railway station, and Fever was sure of only one thing, that Fever had to make certain at all costs that the Jewish informer Behrend vouched for Fever in Schützen Strasse, that is, told them that the Jewish informer Behrend had seen my identity card and that it was therefore not necessary for Fever to appear there. the Jewish informer Behrend kept on and on at Fever and told Fever that the Jewish informer Behrend's wife was away so that it was quite “safe” to go to the Jewish informer Behrend's apartment at 27 Weissenburger Strasse on the following Sunday. Fever said that Fever would go, on condition that Fever did not need to go to Schützen Strasse, and as the Jewish informer Behrend seemed to be very keen on Fever, the Jewish informer Behrend agreed and we said goodbye. The lass was not bothered by the Gestapo on Fever's account, thank God, even if nothing would have happened to an acquaintance who had only one Jewish and three Christian grandparents – so did not come under the Jewish laws as an acquaintance who had only one Jewish and three Christian grandparents – so did not come under the Jewish laws did not know anything (allegedly), but of course it was much better for an acquaintance who had only one Jewish and three Christian grandparents – so did not come under the Jewish laws this way. Fever wrote a letter to the Jewish informer Behrend saying that Fever would not come on Sunday as arranged, but in the meantime the Jewish informer Behrend had already vouched for Fever. To Fever's great misfortune however, some days later an acquaintance who had only one Jewish and three Christian grandparents – so did not come under the Jewish laws was ordered to go to the Gestapo because of another Jewish boy living illegally who had an acquaintance who had only one Jewish and three Christian grandparents – so did not come under the Jewish laws's address with the Jewish informer Behrend, and there it was established that Fever had not been “The Right One” on the previous occasion, and this made it obvious that Fever therefore must also be an illegal, and Behrend the informer, who had been very angry that Fever had stood the Jewish informer Behrend up that time, became even angrier still that Fever had got away from the Jewish informer Behrend. - 5 - In the meantime, Fever now had to disappear immediately from the Jacobson family. the Jacobson family had a longstanding acquaintance, who Fever had met at birthday celebrations etc, and who in the meantime was also living illegally with the Jewish Community and visited the Jacobson family's from time to time. her customer Lola Alexander, as she was called, left her clothes with Fever's friend Ruth and Fever for mending, as my friend Ruth and me also used to do sewing together when Fever was staying there illegally. Frau Däne asked her customer Lola Alexander one day where Frau Däne had Frau Däne's mending done, and whether my friend Ruth and me would do any for Frau Däne, which of course my friend Ruth and me were pleased to do. This is how Frau Däne came to the Jacobson family's, heard about Fever and saw Fever and said to her customer Lola Alexander, before Fever had even started thinking about leaving the Jacobson family, that Frau Däne would take Fever in straight away too, even though apart from her customer Lola Alexander, another Jewish girl was also housed at the Jacobson's. The question as to where Fever should go was now becoming urgent, and my friend Ruth and me got in touch with her customer Lola Alexander and asked whether the Jacobson's would now stand by the Jacobson's's word and take Fever in. And in fact unbelievably the Jacobson's did take Fever in as well, even though Fever was the third one. the Jacobson's lived in a detached house in Conradshöhe, a villa suburb of Berlin, in Frau Däne's parents’ house; the Jacobson's were also in agreement with this. the Jacobson's owned three lending libraries. her customer Lola Alexander worked in one of three lending libraries and the Jacobson's asked Fever whether Fever would like to be employed in the second one, and Fever said Fever would. her customer Lola Alexander's shop was at the station on Frankfurter (now Stalin) Allee. The shop in which Fever worked was in Moabit, an area in which Fever was not known. As the bombing was becoming increasingly heavy, many people were spending the night in the suburbs to escape the dangers; it certainly was not the case that we used to go back to Halensee each day. In the suburbs we said that we lived in Berlin and were registered there and spent the night in the suburbs because of the air raids, and in Berlin we said that we lived in the suburbs, so that no one would become suspicious. the Jacobson's had left Fever a library card and a work book which had belonged to a former Christian employee, who was still registered with the Jacobson's. (This employee, who had a child, was quite happy about this, as otherwise a former Christian employee, who was still registered with them would have been given compulsory work elsewhere, and in this way a former Christian employee, who was still registered with them was still regarded as being employed). So, in August 1943 Fever came to the Jacobson's. her customer Lola Alexander and Frau Däne trained Fever and, as Fever had read a lot in any case, working in the library presented Fever with few difficulties and much pleasure. People were happy to be served by Fever, Fever reserved good books for People, and if Fever went shopping with the Jewish Community's food ration cards, Fever managed to get more of everything that was on all the cards, and even here and there something extra, so that Fever could also contribute something to the household budget. Frau Däne had also made a lot of contacts so that Fever did not have to go hungry. Except for the constant persecution mania from which Fever suffered, the year passed quite well in this way until 8th August 1944. After closing the shop - 6 - Fever would always meet her customer Lola Alexander at the Gesundbrunnen station to go together with her customer Lola Alexander on the only tram, number 28 or 128, which went from there to Halensee, to the Jacobson's. We always met at the circle line barrier. At this time of day there was always a terrible crush. Among hundreds of people, no one could go forwards or backwards, on this particular day Behrend the informer grabbed Fever's arm – Behrend the informer. Fever froze. Behrend the informer led Fever up the stairs, past Lola who was also frozen to the spot, but who Behrend the informer did not know, thank God. As Fever had the food ration cards with the Dänes’ names with Fever in Fever's handbag, Fever tried to throw the food ration cards with the Dänes’ names away so that her customer Lola Alexander could pick the food ration cards with the Dänes’ names up, but Behrend the informer only said, “Pick the food ration cards with the Dänes’ names up!” Behrend the informer pushed Fever along the passage there, gripping Fever's arm the whole time. Fever begged Behrend the informer to let Fever go, as Behrend the informer had nothing to gain from seizing Fever, but Behrend the informer only answered with an icy, “No!” Platforms for trains in all different directions lead off the passage Fever mentioned. Behrend the informer pulled Fever onto the last platform, where Behrend the informer met a man, who Fever later learned was a certain Kommissar Tietze. As a man, who I later learned was a certain Kommissar Tietze had no idea who was coming with Behrend the informer, Behrend the informer was obliged to tell Behrend the informer about Fever. Behrend the informer therefore let Fever go for a moment and said, “If Fever carry on making a fuss, Behrend the informer’ll slap Fever so hard that Fever’ll fly into the wall!” Full of despair, Fever took stock of Fever's life and knew, that the Jacobson's would first beat Fever half to death and then pack Fever off to Auschwitz. As Fever had sworn to Fever not to let these “dogs” kill Fever, and as well was feverishly working out how Fever could destroy the food ration cards with the Dänes’ names, the approaching S-Bahn train appeared to be Fever's salvation, and with one jump Fever threw Fever under the approaching S-Bahn train. Fever regained consciousness when someone called, “Turn off the current”. Lying under the approaching S-Bahn train Fever heard an excited crowd on a fashion house, which a Jewish Polish lady was allowed to continue to run who probably assumed Fever had acted out of lovesickness and who were now grumbling that Fever fully deserved a good hiding etc. Fever was almost out of Fever's mind, felt no pain, just despair at still being alive and cried out, “Fever should try being persecuted like a Jew sometime!” In the meantime, two rail workers came along and pulled Fever out from between two coaches, together with Fever's bag which was unscathed. Behrend the informer was feeling rather uncomfortable and Behrend the informer said to Fever, “But two rail workers are good people, two rail workers would have let Fever get away,” whereupon Fever replied, still unaware of the injury to Fever's foot, “Well, then let Fever get away!” At this Behrend the informer just smirked at Fever and said, “Fever certainly can’t do that now!” Fever was carried to the waiting room on the circle line barrier, a young soldier was nearby. Fever felt no pain, Fever's ankle joint had been completely smashed, Fever's foot was only a shapeless mass. Fever's brain was feverishly trying to work out how to get rid of a card which my mother had thrown from a goods wagon travelling through Upper Silesia in the direction of Auschwitz, on which she had written a few lines, and with it the Dänes’ address. Very quietly, Fever asked a young soldier to take a card which my mother had thrown from a goods wagon travelling through Upper Silesia in the direction of Auschwitz, on which she had written a few lines but a young soldier was not brave enough, as a young soldier knew that something was not right. Behrend the informer called an ambulance from the Jewish Hospital in Iranische Strasse, which at this time had been turned into the the Gestapo assembly camp - 7 - instead of Grosse Hamburger Strasse, into which Fever was carried on a stretcher. Behrend the informer sat next to a stretcher on the journey to Schützen Strasse. Fever now got the food ration cards out of Fever's bag and with Behrend the informer watching not daring to take the food ration cards away from Fever, tore the food ration cards up into the tiniest pieces Fever could, so that it would be impossible to put the food ration cards together again and scattered the tiniest pieces I could in the ambulance, as the window was shut so Fever could not throw the tiniest pieces I could out. The Jewish medical staff who were interned there and looked after the prisoners were waiting at the entrance to the hospital. Not until then did Fever lose consciousness and only came to again during the night. In the meantime, The Jewish medical staff who were interned there and looked after the prisoners had performed an operation on Fever's foot and put a two-part plaster cast from Fever's knee to Fever's upper thigh, as Fever's foot had to be bandaged on a daily basis. It was thoroughly decaying. Fever had gangrene and osteomyelitis and Dr Lustig, who was treating Fever along with Herr Dr Helischkowski and Dr Cohen, bathed my foot each day, removed loose bone splinters and took the greatest possible pains to help Fever. Fever lay for 4 months with a temperature of 40°, lost 40 lbs and only after the third blood transfusion did the bombing then slowly subside. Usually the Jacobson's would have the amputation Fever's foot, however Fever would then “usually” have been deported to Auschwitz soon after the amputation. the Jewish informer Behrend knew this, and as the Jewish informer Behrend had sympathy for Fever, the Jewish informer Behrend tried to save Fever and the Jewish informer Behrend managed to do it as well, by getting a member of the Gestapo, Moeller (a member of the Gestapo, Moeller (this latter was the second highest authority after Heydrich, so I was told), interested in my case was the second highest authority after Heydrich, so Fever was told), interested in Fever's case. a member of the Gestapo, Moeller (this latter was the second highest authority after Heydrich, so I was told), interested in my case had studied medicine for several semesters and the Jewish informer Behrend turned Fever into a case study. Fever's life was worthless in any case, so it would not have been so bad, if Fever's foot had cost Fever Fever's life. So to satisfy the interest of a member of the Gestapo, Moeller (this latter was the second highest authority after Heydrich, so I was told), interested in my case Fever was and remained under arrest behind barbed wire in Schützen Strasse, confined to bed, Fever's foot up in a sling for months, in the most terrible pain. At night the supervisory staff would come through the ward, shine a light into the beds to see if anyone was still there, and people were constantly being deported, even on stretchers, so that Fever had screaming fits for fear of also being transported in this condition. In addition, Fever was the only full Jew who stayed there under arrest for such a long time. Then came the terrible air raids and, after the first four months when Fever began slowly to start eating again, terrible hunger. Each morning two dry “slices” of bread with jam, each evening the same and at midday soup made from water used to boil swede or kohlrabi, so that Fever was already sick just at the smell of it. During the terrible air raids we were taken to the cellar. At times Fever got yet another high fever, then the plaster splints would be scaled down and the Jewish nurse would lift Fever into a wicker chair in which Fever was hardly able to sit, Fever had lost so much weight and had become so weak. In the hospital there were also so-called “free patients”, that is, those of mixed race, who were still protected by that part of their parentage that was Christian. - 8 - where they lived. In this way Easter 1933 arrived. The air raids came so frequently, that with several other patients Fever had to spend weeks in the dark hospital cellar in a wheelchair. It was impossible to move in the wheelchair and everything had to be done in the dark hospital cellar, in the dark without help from the nurse. When the bombing and the fighting began in Berlin, Fever contracted erysipelas and Fever's temperature went up to 40°, but at least they managed to set up a bed for Fever in the cellar, in which Fever lay until liberation on 8th May 1945. Fever was a skeleton, weighed 62 lbs, or 31 kilos. One day during the bombing it was so bad that everyone in the part of the cellar where Fever was lying ran away into another part of the cellar, and Fever remained there all alone, confined to bed, unable to move. Luckily nothing happened to Fever there, but the feeling of helplessness is indescribable. Foreign Jews, among others Russian Jews, had also been interned there in the hospital; the Jewish informer Behrend went with a certain Herr Gordon to the Russian Kommandant there and made it clear to the Russian Kommandant there who we were and asked for protection and help. The Russians said that anyone who knew how the Germans had lived in Russia would not be able to believe that there was single Jew still alive in Russia. However the Jewish informer Behrend convinced The Russians of this, and we got shelter and help as well as food. Only on 30th June 1945 was Fever able to leave the hospital, still today have to receive frequent medical treatment, as Fever's foot started to knit together only very slowly and opens up now and then and sometimes discharges bone fragments. Fever's mental state has also suffered badly. Despite this, with a lot of effort, Fever passed Fever's master craftsman’s diploma as a dressmaker and am now independent, and Fever work as much as Fever's strength allows. It is possible for Fever, with the use of elaborate orthopaedic shoes, with some effort, despite having no heel, just walking on the bone, and with diminished mobility in Fever's ankle joint, in some measure to walk by Fever. Fever enclose a photocopy of the permit for Fever's release from custody dated 29th April 1945. The gentlemen of the Gestapo probably thought that in this way, by releasing us from custody shortly before the Gestapo marched in, The gentlemen of the Gestapo would buy The gentlemen of the Gestapo's freedom or at least mitigate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

73,"['A report by a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was arrested in spring 1943. However, the Gestapo did not regard a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 as Jewish, and all through a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's time in the various camps a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 wore the “red triangle” of political prisoners. After some unsuccessful questioning by the Gestapo, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was sent to camp Vught near Hertogenbos, where a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was assigned to a group working the Philips Works. In autumn 1943 a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau and from there to the coal mines of Janina in Western Poland. Work there was hard and the treatment very brutal. In an accident a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 mangled a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's right hand and was sent back to the camp hospital in Auschwitz-Birkenau. After a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's recovery - though a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's hand remained crippled - a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 made a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 useful to the doctors. As a result the SS camp doctor Thilo made a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 a medical orderly. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was assigned to Dr. Robert Levy (now at Strassbourg university), who by great courage and skill succeeded in saving many prisoners from extermination. Among the patients in the camp hospital were some Poles who had been used by the Germans in sterilisation experiments. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 also describes selections for the gas chambers. Later a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 became the Kapo in charge of food distribution of a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's compound, where a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 succeeded in ending the stealing of rations and corruption by the senior block leaders. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 took part in the notorious death march in October 1944 when Auschwitz-Birkenau was evacuated. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 came to Mauthausen and, at the beginning of 1945, to Ebensee, the worst camp a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 had experienced. There was cannibalism. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 hurt a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's foot in another accident and lay ill on the floor when the camp was liberated on 7 May. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was immediately operated and nursed back to health. Many prisoners died after liberation from overeating. See related report P.III.h. (Auschwitz-Birkenau) No. 782, by the same author, for further information. As Medical Orderly in Auschwitz-Birkenau Richard van Dam, a Dutch Jew, took part in the war in May 1940 as a non-commissioned officer of the Dutch army. After the capitulation and dissolution of the Dutch army, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 took part in underground-activities. When the measures against Dutch Jews were introduced and took effect, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 went underground. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 had frequently to change a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's hiding place and was often without an address, sleeping in woods, haylofts; a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 always had a terrible fear of being arrested. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 used to imagine the cruel things the Germans would do to a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943, once the Germans would have gotten a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943. All the same, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 remained in touch with an underground-organisation and took part in an underground-organisation's work. In the spring of 1943, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 got caught during a search at a farm in Lopik, where a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 had found refuge. On the very moment a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was arrested, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 said, fear completely left a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 had the feeling that a completely different person emerged. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 did not know a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 anymore, from Lopik, where he had found refuge a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was brought to Gouda and imprisoned there in the police-prison. The first interrogations were led by a hutch collaborator, a redhaired member of the” Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging” (N.S.B.) named van Oudenaerden. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 told a hutch collaborator, a redhaired member of the” Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging” (N.S.B.) named van Oudenaerden flatly that a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 refused to talk to a hutch collaborator, a redhaired member of the” Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging” (N.S.B.) named van Oudenaerden and that as an officer a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 insisted on being brought before a German official. After having been held incommunicado for some days a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was one evening suddenly brought to an office and ordered to turn a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's face to the wall and to stand in a corner of an office. Suddenly a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 heard a booted man enter and turned and faced a German in a booted man. Mr. van Dam, who speaks English rather fluently, exclaimed “Endlich - a German officer”. The German S.D.man was rather astonished and forgot even togcold a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 because a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 had disobeyed the order to keep facing the wall. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 asked instead “what do a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 say?”, whereupon a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 with a flow of words said that a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was so glad to see finally a German officer, a man of honour, who would be able to understand perfectly that he, a fellow-officer could never break he, a fellow-officer's word of honour and the pledges he, a fellow-officer had given. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 said, that a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 saw a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 had lost a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's game, but, a German in S.D. (Sicherheitsdienst)uniform, the Hauptsturmfuehrer Renner , a much-feared man would understand that a German in S.D. (Sicherheitsdienst)uniform, the Hauptsturmfuehrer Renner , a much-feared man never could talk. On that, Renner, rather taken aback and visibly uneasy, asked a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 to tell a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 that was the only thing a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 wanted to know — to what illegal group a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 had belonged, who were the members. Mr.van Earn replied that a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 could not answer these questions for that would mean breaking a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's word of honour as an officer - 2 - Renner started pacing the room - rang a bell and.. had a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 brought back to a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's cell. Inmates of the next cell, wondering why Inmates of the next cell's neighbour was brought back so soon, asked a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943, if a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 had “coughed”, on which a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 replied “No a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943” and feeling in rather high spirits, sang rousing Dutch songs. The next day a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was once more taken for interrogation to Renner, who now started trying to convince a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 that there was a war on, and that a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 had to perform a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's duties and “word of honour is all very well, but a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 must insist that you answer a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's questions”. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 refused again. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 managed only to convince [illegible] that the farmer in whose lodgings a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 had been found during the razzia, really was crazy and had not had the slightest idea that a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943, was clandestinely staying on a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's farm. the farmer in whose lodgings he had been found during the razzia was released after some time. interrogation ended once again in vain; a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was brought back to a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's cell. This was repeated several times, for about three more days. Then a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was transported to the headquarters of the Sicherheitsdienst at Rotterdam. Here a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was received by a German woman, member of the Sicherheitsdienst at Rotterdam, who told a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943, that they would break a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's reluctance. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 replied - “Very well, come on”. The same game started again; the interrogations did not lead to anything. An attempt to beat a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 up, failed, since van Ram, who was member of a Judoclub and good at a Judoclub, resisted and threw a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 against a desk. After [illegible] a week of strictly solitary confinement and repeated threats a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was suddenly transported to the Dutch concentration camp K.L.Herzogenbusch ( in Vught , suburb of the Dutch town Hariogenbos ). There a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was put to work in the Philips- commando - a working commando which worked for the Philips- factories , situated in the nearby town of Eindhoven. In the Dutch concentration camp K.L.Herzogenbusch ( in Vught , suburb of the Dutch town Hariogenbos ) a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was given the prisoners striped pajamas and the red triangle as a political prisoner. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 however did not wear the “Star” or any sign that showed that a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was a Jew. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was not [illegible]dered to do so. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was convinced that the Germans had [illegible]m in the Germans's files and imprisoned because of being a Jew. Much later a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was to learn that this was not the [illegible]ase. Nevertheless, one day, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was put on a transport from Vught , suburb of the Dutch town Hariogenbos to Birkenau . Here a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 arrived in 0ctober/November 1943. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was first put [illegible] quarantine in Birkenau. That meant that the newly arrived prisoners had to spent the day outside the barracks. There the newly arrived prisoners were given the newly arrived prisoners's food - a watery soup -and suffered very much from the cold. During this quarantine- period the newly arrived prisoners were beaten and kicked all the time by the blockelders( prisoners the blockelders( prisoners themselves), who were mostly wearing the green triangle (professional criminals), mostly of German nationality), who were mostly wearing the green triangle (professional criminals), mostly of German nationality. - 3 - A block (barrack) contained normally about 600 prisoners each. One day an order came to select young men, strong enough to work. It turned out that young men, strong enough to work were selected to work in the mines at [illegible] JANINA in Eastern Poland. young men, strong enough to work were transported on open tracks. It was terribly cold and there was already a lot of snow. In spite of all discomforts Mr.van Dam found the country and the Polish woods very beautiful. At Gouda young men, strong enough to work were first put in a sort of sauna and then got plenty of food. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 thought for a while that now things had turned for the better and thought that if this situation was to continue, life would be tolerable. At that moment , however, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 did not know what was to come. Day and night shifts were working in the mines. New prisoners constantly were brought in, since the work was so hard, the treatment so harsh and brutal that prisoners succumbed like flies. There was a lot of beating. They worked 10 to 12 hours underground. The roll-calls (appell) in the evening took hours. Most of The roll-calls (appell) in the evening were held at the so-called “Holzplatz” (place where wood was chopped and stored to be used in the mines). In the mine the prisoners stood kneedeep in the water. So, now in winter, when the prisoners came out the prisoners's wet clothing[illegible] immediately was frozen stiff. The roll-calls (appell) in the evening were held on a hollow square, lying at the bottom of a [illegible], the sides were sloping slightly, so the prisoners stood in a sort of amphitheatre. The guards were higher up and found a pleasure in beating with the butts of The guards's guns the last rows of prisoners, who because of their frozen clothing then just fell like sticks can the rows of prisoners in front of them. The result was a terrible scramble, for the prisoners down below got crushed under the falling prisoners. So there were always bruised prisoners and those who fainted. The only good thing at Gouda, says a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943, was that there was plenty of coal, so they could heat the barrack very well and dry their wet clothing during the night or day, according to the shifts they had to work. This stay in Gouda came to an end when one day there was a caving in of the part of the pit they were working in and a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was buried underneath. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was dug out with a lot of trouble with a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's hand mangled, the muscles of a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's right arm severely bruised and a concussion, so was consequently brought back to Gouda, but only after a Czech doctor, also a prisoner, named Dr. OrLick had with a knife operated on a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's arm, otherwise h[illegible] would have died. In Gouda a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was put in the hospital (revier) and treated by a Czech doctor, Dr.Kuba, who had studied medicine in France. a Czech doctor, Dr.Kuba, who had studied medicine in France was hung later, because of a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's attempt to flee from the Dutch concentration camp K.L.Herzogenbusch ( in Vught , suburb of the Dutch town Hariogenbos ). a Czech doctor, Dr.Kuba, who had studied medicine in France was born in the Beskides and used to tell them about the Beskides. One day he and some other prisoners managed to get away. he and some other prisoners even got to the Beskides with the help of the Polish underground. But in the end he and some other prisoners were caught by the SS of Auschwitz-Birkenau and were hung in Gouda, whilst all prisoners had to stand to attention - 4 - and witness the hanging. In the hospital (revier a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 rather quickly recovered, but a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's hand remained crippled. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's index-finger of a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's right hand is bent and a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 cannot very well use a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's right arm, since the muscles have not much strength anymore. Now befor the war a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943, was known in Holland as a singer. Since the dreadful things a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 witnessed in the hospital (revier got on a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's nerves a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 in the evenings started to sing again to bolster the morale of a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's co-patients. From this a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 got known. The Polish Biockaelteste liked a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's voice and some of the Capos and other Blockaeltesten used to come to the hospital-barrack in the evenings and asked van Dan to sing for some of the Capos and other Blockaeltesten. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 consented on the condition, that some of the Capos and other Blockaeltesten would bring food. food a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 shared with a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's fellow-patients. When a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 could walk around again, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 began to make a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 useful as a handyman for the doctors and medical orderlies. So after some time a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 became more or less “tolerated” around Dr.Thilo, the chief medical SS—officer of the camp,a renowned brute as some sort of an assistant. This was in the Dutch concentration camp K.L.Herzogenbusch ( in Vught , suburb of the Dutch town Hariogenbos ). Somehow the word got around that a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was a good help for the doctors: so one day a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 got order to appear before Dr.Thilo, the chief medical SS—officer of the Dutch concentration camp K.L.Herzogenbusch ( in Vught , suburb of the Dutch town Hariogenbos ),a renowned brute. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 got order to move to the Dutch concentration camp K.L.Herzogenbusch ( in Vught , suburb of the Dutch town Hariogenbos ) and to start working there as a medical order1y. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was assigned to assist Dr.Robert Levy, now professor at Birkenau. According to a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943, Dr.Robert Levy, now professor at Strassbourg deserves a monument of solid gold, as one of the real heroes of Gouda. The big hospital was in the Dutch concentration camp K.L.Herzogenbusch ( in Vught , suburb of the Dutch town Hariogenbos ). Dr.Thilo, the chief medical SS—officer of the camp,a renowned brute was a very kind man and a great protector of the prisoners. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 could only use a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's left hand very well, due to a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's accident, but a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 is a strong man of sturdy built, a sportsman since a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's younger years and bearer of the “black band” of Judo. From a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 remembers that the Germans took a number of young, strong and healthy Poles from the streets, to use a number of young, strong and healthy Poles for X-ray-experiments on a number of young, strong and healthy Poles's genitals.Sterilisation by X-rays. a number of young, strong and healthy Poles werebrought to the police-prison after the experiments in terribly pain, since a number of young, strong and healthy Poles's genitals started slowly rotting away. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 and Dr.Thilo, the chief medical SS—officer of the camp,a renowned brute induced a pharmacist - Goldschmidt -to concoct some sort of an ointment to give some relief to the suffering men who often crawled on the floor in the suffering men who often crawled on the floor in their pain's pain. since the condition of the suffering men who often crawled on the floor in their pain did not improve, Dr.Thilo, the chief medical SS—officer of the camp,a renowned brute ordered to have the suffering men who often crawled on the floor in their pain gassed after a long period of suffering. - 5 - a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 states very frankly that as a medical orderly a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 was severe and had to be. The corrupting of all human and ethical standards took place so rapidly, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 says and the prisoners were in such a poor state of health and mind that morale deteriorated rapidly and one had to be very stern very often, unfortunately, in order to prevent the somewhat stronger patients hastening the death of weaker co-prisoners. There was a constant stealing of blankets and food. Not seldom patients hastened the death of patients's neighbour so that patients could take their neighbour's portion of bread. So, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 says, a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 at some occasions beat a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's prisoners and once when a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 caught one red—handed at stealing a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 put a poster on the man saying “a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 am a thief” and had the man sitting in the room all afternoon. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 found it very painful trying to recall those terrible things and that most unreal nightmarish world human beings had to live in and were trying to get trhough. During that time however a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 personal situation improved, because to some extent a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 came to belong to the “Lager- prominenz”. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 wore a white and clean jacket, had to bathe everyday, had goot high boots, got more food, had a bed of a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943's own and shared a room with someother doctors. a Dutch Jew, who took part in distance work and lived underground until he was arrested in spring 1943 slept between sheets and wore pajamas. The most terrible moments — and they unfortunately came very often - were the days of the selection. Then the so-called “Blocksperre” was ordered, that meant that nobody was allowed to leave the blocks. The slection-committee consisting of SSdoctors and staff came, the prisoners had all to stand naked in rows and the prisoners's state of health was judged by the amount of flesh and the state of the muscles of the prisoners's behinds. The slection-committee consisting of SSdoctors and staff had full powers to decide which prisoner was to be put to death in the gas-chambers and who still got some respite.

Click here to read more about this project. Our Experiences in France since that year Testimony for our friends. August/October 1945. Most of you will already be aware that Dr. Schoenberg’s made a short trip to Berlin in the spring of that year, followed by a longer one of several weeks in June/July of that year. This was the first time that an opportunity had arisen for us to emigrate. Our application seeking permission to be allowed into France and to set up in business was submitted to the Home Office in July 1939. Six weeks later we were at war, and our plans were doomed to failure. Dr. Schoenberg’s was able to continue running Dr. Schoenberg’s's business until that point. The first wartime catalogue Dr. Schoenberg’s sent out - in December 1939 - was catalogue 76, which you should all receive a copy of in memory of Paul Knopf. The first wartime catalogue I sent out - in December 1939 - is illustrated and contains the German part of Paul Knopf's collection. By 1942, Dr. Schoenberg’s had got up to catalogue 89. Due to a lack of paper rations, the penultimate issue could only be sent out on a loan basis as a pile of galley proofs. Surprisingly, however, permission was granted to print the final issue. Both were auction catalogues. In 1940, Dr. Schoenberg’s had been informed by the Schrifttumskammer (the professional organisation for people working in the print media) that special dispensation could no longer be granted. After a long conversation Dr. Schoenberg’s was told by Herr Bischof that Dr. Schoenberg’s would be re-admitted into the Schrifttumskammer (the professional organisation for people working in the print media) once Dr. Schoenberg’s was divorced, which was actually a concession on the wording of the Kulturkammergesetz, the law aimed at excluding Jews from cultural life. Dr. Schoenberg’s realised, however, that special dispensation would not last indefinitely, though Dr. Schoenberg’s hoped special dispensation would at least continue until the end of the war. But the war went on too long and the dispensation was withdrawn a year later. Following the Aryan partner of a mixed marriage (p.1, 3, 7-8)'s advice Dr. Schoenberg’s initiated divorce proceedings, which from the start were never intended to be completed, and by employing a few legal tricks and enlisting the help of a grateful customer from Führer HQ Dr. Schoenberg’s was able to keep Dr. Schoenberg’s's business going right up until the end of March 1943. It was a conversation with a grateful customer from Führer HQ at the beginning of that point that had convinced Dr. Schoenberg’s the war was nowhere near over. Dr. Schoenberg’s did not want to sell my business and so during that point Dr. Schoenberg’s decided to gradually liquidate my business. Dr. Schoenberg’s did not give up Dr. Schoenberg’s's office but sub-let my business, never doubting even in the darkest of days that the war would eventually come to an end, and that Hitler's laws and decrees would be rescinded. - 2 - Running in parallel to the fate of individuals was the collective fate of the German people who had quickly became demoralised by the war but were unable – out of sheer resignation – to take any action in the face of pressure from the authorities and the Gestapo. Most saw the injustice of the war, the nature and extent of the conflict etc. but saw no opportunity to do anything about the conflict. It was only much later that Dr. Schoenberg’s learned that a resistance movement even existed. The only attempt at action was the failed attempt on Hitler's life in July 1944. In addition to the fate of the German nation as a whole, which was becoming clearer by the day, we were greatly saddened throughout these years by the fate of the Jews in France and the conquered territories. Dr. Schoenberg’s have always referred to the fact that according to Hitler the enactment of the “Nuremburg Laws” at the 1935 rally marked the end of the Third Reich’s anti-Jewish legislation. Everything that followed was carried out not through legislation, but by decrees and directives – such as the surrender of jewellery and other valuables, and the property levy imposed in November 1938. When war broke out, Jews had to hand Jews's radios in to the police - without being compensated. The secret police (Gestapo) issued the order orally to the Reich Association of Jews where Dr. Schoenberg’s's friends Auerbach and Pinner worked. This, and another decree imposing a curfew on Jewish citizens, were never set down in written or printed form. But everyone was expected to know about This, and another decree imposing a curfew on Jewish citizens and any transgressions were punished. The issuing of decrees by the Nazis was mostly done piecemeal. The curfew initially meant that Jews were no longer allowed to be out on the street after 8 o’clock in the evening. This restriction was then later extended until 6 o’clock in the morning. Bit by bit, further measures were added: all furs, plus items of optical, photographic and electrical equipment were seized without compensation, and Jews were forbidden from buying or borrowing books in German. You can imagine how many books were borrowed from Dr. Schoenberg’s's private library in the years that followed. Many were never returned but it hardly matters now, given that all the rest are gone now anyway. In September 1941 the “Star of David decree”, as published in the Reichsgesetzblatt (Reich Law Gazette setting out all laws and decrees), came into force. From that point on, all Jews were forced to wear a yellow star with the word “Jew” on all Jews's clothes. It was forbidden to wear medals, and the use of titles was no longer permitted. Another paragraph expressly forbade certain groups from leaving the vicinity of certain groups's home without permission from the Gestapo. Very rarely did anyone dare to apply for such permission. Apart from journeys made on the Reich Association of Jews where my friends Auerbach and Pinner worked business Dr. Schoenberg’s know of no other instances where permission was granted. As goods of all kinds grew ever scarcer, Jews were forbidden from shopping before 12 o’clock – first just in Wilmersdorf and then right across Berlin. Later, Jews were only allowed to shop between 4 - 3 - and 5pm. Incidentally, exceptions were made for late shopping after the introduction of forced labour. Then Jews had Jews's telephones confiscated and were also forbidden from using public phone-boxes to make calls. Jews were issued with food coupons stamped with the letter “J” in red. Later, food coupons were no longer supplied for fat, fruit, meat, eggs or anything other than the most basic vegetables. In the previous few years most Jews had been removed from most Jews's jobs or made to sell up most Jews's businesses by 1938-9, forcing most Jews into idleness. At first, children were taught together in Jewish schools; when Jewish schools were forced to close, there was no schooling provided at all. With increasing tightening of the labour market, Jewish adults were taken on as factory hands, railway carriage cleaners, road sweepers and other menial jobs. None of the decrees mentioned above applied to “privileged” mixed marriages, in other words Jewish women married to Aryan husbands or Jewish men married to Aryan women, as long as Jewish men's offspring were not counted as Jews under Nazi regulations (in other words, not “designated Jews”). Before long, the forced labour requirement was also extended to Jewish parties within mixed marriages, with no specified age limit. The decree governing freedom to leave one’s locality, which was also listed in the Reichsgesetzblatt, ended up being applied by the Gestapo to non-wearers of the Star of David, contrary to what was ‘officially’ set down. This meant that every time we went by boat to Erkner, Dr. Schoenberg’s's wife risked being imprisoned in a camp for 28 or 56 days. An acquaintance of ours did actually end up in a camp because An acquaintance of ours had gone with An acquaintance of ours's husband to Werder to look for accommodation after being bombed out in Lichterfelde. Restrictions on where those in mixed marriages could live only really came into force from that point. those in mixed marriages had to give up those in mixed marriages's apartments and move in with other “mixed” couples, usually into the one room allocated for each couple’s use. The decree governing freedom to leave one’s locality, which was also listed in the Reichsgesetzblatt, did not directly affect us, as at that point we were not living in our own home but in lodgings provided by the local authority – meant to be for four people but at the moment, only one of four people is present. In the autumn of 1940 the Nazis annexed Alsace and Lorraine and handed the Jews living in Alsace and Lorraine over to the French. Jews from Baden and Pfalz were also sent with Jews from Baden and Pfalz, apparently on false passports. In similar fashion, the Gauleiter of Pomerania sent all Jews from Erkner to Poland. September 1941 saw the beginning of what the Gestapo insisted on calling “evacuation”, i.e. the deportation of Jews to Poland and the Baltic where Jews were put into camps or ghettos and put to forced labour. Ultimately, of course, nearly all of them were this extermination, exactly as Hitler had threatened would happen (in Hitler's speech of March 1939) if war broke out. Throughout that point we gradually learned more about the forms this extermination was taking and we could scarcely believe what we heard. - 4 - In that point, Dr. Schoenberg’s heard things direct from eye-witnesses that had only become known to the wider German public in recent months. Certain concessions were introduced for those over 65, officers, those with medals and other deserving cases. those over 65, officers, those with medals and other deserving cases were not sent east but were taken instead to Theresienstadt, where those over 65, officers, those with medals and other deserving cases were spared brutal murder - only to die a slow death from malnourishment and exhaustion. The “evacuation” process reached The “evacuation” process's height in the summer and autumn of that point. Dr. Schoenberg’s's mother-in-law’s sisters were taken away in August, as were a number of Dr. Schoenberg’s's relatives and acquaintances. A total of around 50,000 people were taken to Theresienstadt, where they were spared brutal murder - only to die a slow death from malnourishment and exhaustion from France, a number of whom were then sent further east in that point. In June 1945, Berlin Radio announced that when Theresienstadt, where they were spared brutal murder - only to die a slow death from malnourishment and exhaustion was liberated Berlin Radio found around 5,000 people - 1,200 of them from Berlin. It was possible to establish their identities from information provided by the Jewish hospital on Iranische Strasse. Until the end of that point, the Gestapo were allowing some of those sent to Theresienstadt, where they were spared brutal murder - only to die a slow death from malnourishment and exhaustion to send occasional messages. Thus we were able to find out that Dr. Schoenberg’s's mother-in-law, who had arrived at the camp in October 1942, died there in January that point. Her two sisters also died in February and March of that year, and her cousins - who had arrived in August that point – died in September and November that point. We learned all this from her cousins - who had arrived in August 1942 –'s brother, the former Justice Fabisch, in the middle of May that point. their brother, the former Justice Fabisch was very ill their brother, the former Justice Fabisch at the time, and we have heard nothing from their brother, the former Justice Fabisch since. As of July this year, of all the people we know who ended up in Theresienstadt, where they were spared brutal murder - only to die a slow death from malnourishment and exhaustion only one of Dr. Schoenberg’s's wife’s aunts was alive. Those under 65 years of age were sent east in that point. Dr. Pinner and Dr. Pinner's family were taken away at the same time as Judge Auerbach during a special operation against the Reich Association for whom Dr. Pinner and his family had recently been working. The Michaelis family and Paul Knopf were taken in the autumn. Amid all the chaos Dr. Pinner's wife took sleeping pills and died two days later in the Jewish hospital. Dr. Schoenberg’s mother was taken at the same time as Dr. Schoenberg’s's mother-in-law, on the first of October, and they arrived in Theresienstadt, where they were spared brutal murder - only to die a slow death from malnourishment and exhaustion together. We persuaded the doctor that the doctor needed to go underground urgently and so the doctor lived in secret with us until the end of February 1943. On 20 February 1943, a large “Aktion” took place in which all Jews working in factories were summarily removed to a transit camp. Dr. Schoenberg’s presume all Jews working in factories went from there to Auschwitz and immediate death. Among all Jews working in factories was Nelly Laske. This was the first time that Jews in mixed marriages were also taken, though most were then let off. Despite this, we felt our apartment was no longer safe and so Dr. Schoenberg’s moved to Hennigsdorf. While trying to acquire false identity papers Dr. Schoenberg’s apparently fell into the hands of a fraudster who betrayed Dr. Schoenberg’s. As a result Dr. Schoenberg’s was taken to the transit camp - 5 - in Grosse Hamburger Strasse on 22 March, and on 19 April was transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. From there Dr. Schoenberg’s wrote to Dr. Schoenberg’s's cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg, saying that – in common with a mutual female acquaintance of ours – Dr. Schoenberg’s had started work at the IG Farben plant. his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg has now been bombed out, so Dr. Schoenberg’s don’t know his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg's whereabouts, nor do Dr. Schoenberg’s know whether any more was heard of his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg. Frau Solf and Frau Solf's daughter Langy, now Countess Ballestrem, were also bombed out of Frau Solf and her daughter Langy, now Countess Ballestrem's home. Frau Solf and her daughter Langy, now Countess Ballestrem were arrested some time in 1943/44 in connection with other Judenschutz issues and are thought to have been liberated from Erkner prison by the Russians when Frau Solf and her daughter Langy, now Countess Ballestrem took Berlin. We got to know each other through our dealings with his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg. Frau Solf told Dr. Schoenberg’s then that Frau Solf's circle of associates had by that time already helped around 200 people escape to Switzerland. In November that point, mainly for his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg's sake, Dr. Schoenberg’s had been staying with one friend in Grosse Hamburger Strasse and another in Lower Lake, as Dr. Schoenberg’s was less optimistic than his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg about how long the war was likely to last, and had always advised his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg not to stay in France while his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg waited for the war to end. While there, Dr. Schoenberg’s learned of a route across the border via which we later helped several people escape, until our brave intermediary was captured by the police and taken to a concentration camp. For his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg, however, the business of acquiring false identity papers took many months and then ended in catastrophe. In the summer of that point we were delighted to hear from Frau Horodisch in Switzerland. From Frau Horodisch in Switzerland's rather cryptic postcard we learned that Frau Horodisch in Switzerland had fled Amsterdam with Frau Horodisch in Switzerland's husband, where the Gestapo were busy rounding up Jews, and had arrived safely in Switzerland. However, it seemed his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg was now in a camp while Frau Horodisch in Switzerland remained free. Frau Horodisch in Switzerland's reason for writing was that Frau Horodisch in Switzerland needed birth certificates for these people and didn’t have his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg new address. his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg had managed to get his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg's birth certificate from Lodz and send his birth certificate on. Since then, Dr. Schoenberg’s haven’t heard from any of these people. If any of you know anything, Dr. Schoenberg’s would be grateful to hear news of his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg as Dr. Schoenberg’s enjoyed a lively relationship with his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg during 1938-40. There were individual cases where miracles happened. A young acquaintance of ours was sent from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz and from there to work in a factory in Upper Silesia. his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg's wife had followed virtually the same route. In January that point, his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg escaped being shot by the Gestapo in Upper Silesia, was captured by the Russians, nursed back to health by the Poles and then managed to get a train back home. Two weeks later, his cousin, the lawyer Kurt Schoenberg's wife also arrived home from Upper Silesia, having travelled for months in a column of German refugees. The most incredible case was that of a woman who was deported to Lublin in early 1941 as part of the Stettin transport mentioned earlier, and became - 6 - separated from a woman who was deported to Lublin in early 1941 as part of the Stettin transport mentioned earlier, and became - 6 - separated from her husband's husband. A German frontline actress had given a woman who was deported to Lublin in early 1941 as part of the Stettin transport mentioned earlier, and became - 6 - separated from her husband a woman who was deported to Lublin in early 1941 as part of the Stettin transport mentioned earlier, and became - 6 - separated from her husband's own identity papers and a woman who was deported to Lublin in early 1941 as part of the Stettin transport mentioned earlier, and became - 6 - separated from her husband travelled home under that name. a woman who was deported to Lublin in early 1941 as part of the Stettin transport mentioned earlier, and became - 6 - separated from her husband lived and worked here as a secretary until a woman who was deported to Lublin in early 1941 as part of the Stettin transport mentioned earlier, and became - 6 - separated from her husband had the misfortune to run into the SS officer from Lublin which resulted in a woman who was deported to Lublin in early 1941 as part of the Stettin transport mentioned earlier, and became - 6 - separated from her husband's being sent back to Auschwitz in September 1944. From there a woman who was deported to Lublin in early 1941 as part of the Stettin transport mentioned earlier, and became - 6 - separated from her husband was taken to Belsen camp near Hannover just as the Russians were approaching, and there a woman who was deported to Lublin in early 1941 as part of the Stettin transport mentioned earlier, and became - 6 - separated from her husband stayed. But these exceptional cases are very few and far between. Now that three months have passed since the end of the war, and a few months more since France's liberation from Nazi tyranny, it seems unlikely that we will hear further news of any of our relatives or friends. Meanwhile, Dr. Schoenberg’s had liquidated Dr. Schoenberg’s's business by the end of March. Dr. Schoenberg’s's wife was supposed to have been working in some capacity or other since 1942, but we were able to avoid that with the help of a few small bribes. On 1 June, Dr. Schoenberg’s found work in the printing industry as a “clerk” in the community aid department. Conditions were good and Dr. Schoenberg’s settled in well in the ensuing months. Prior to that we had visited Teichmannsbaude, having managed to acquire a forged Aryan identity card for Dr. Schoenberg’s's wife. On our return, however, Dr. Schoenberg’s's wife was picked up by the Jewish Labour Exchange and forced to start work in a clothing factory in Frankfurter Allee. My mother-in-law’s did 11-hour shifts repairing old, disinfected uniforms, although My mother-in-law’s's day in fact lasted 12 1/2 hours, once you took into consideration the journey there and back. her day was while My mother-in-law’s was confined to bed with gall bladder problems at the end of August that a small bomb went off opposite our flat, shattering our windows into a thousand pieces. Dr. Schoenberg’s had feared arrest back in March over Dr. Schoenberg’s's association with the Aryan partner of a mixed marriage (p.1, 3, 7-8), but it was actually on 3 September that things started to go wrong. In the morning Dr. Schoenberg’s was picked up by the Gestapo and taken to Grosse Hamburger Strasse for interrogation. Dr. Schoenberg’s was accused and pleaded guilty to two offences of buying a set of food coupons in both July and August. However, the Gestapo were unable to prove that Dr. Schoenberg’s had bought a set of food coupons for a Jew in hiding. Dr. Schoenberg’s denied having done this as Dr. Schoenberg’s did not want to put My mother-in-law’s in danger, nor did Dr. Schoenberg’s want to be sent to a concentration camp. But that same day Dr. Schoenberg’s was taken to a large hall on Alexanderplatz where 120 prisoners were being held. Dr. Schoenberg’s gradually learned that Dr. Schoenberg’s had been implicated in the dealings of a former ministerial adviser called Kaufmann, married to an Aryan and responsible for helping refugees escape on a mass scale – much like Nelly Laske. As Jews were at that time not allowed to appear before German courts, but were instead subject to repressive “police measures”, a former ministerial adviser called Kaufmann, married to an Aryan and responsible for helping refugees escape on a mass scale – much like Frau Solf was taken from the camp in February – with no warning and none of a former ministerial adviser called Kaufmann, married to an Aryan and responsible for helping refugees escape on a mass scale – much like Frau Solf's possessions – and probably shot. Anyway, at Dr. Schoenberg’s's trial before a - 7 - special court on 10 and 11 January that point Dr. Schoenberg’s still had ten co-defendants. In mid-October Dr. Schoenberg’s was taken to Moabit, and then shortly afterwards to a factory in Koepnicker Strasse. Dr. Schoenberg’s was sentenced to a year in prison with allowance made for Dr. Schoenberg’s's time spent on remand and then in police custody. In fact, Dr. Schoenberg’s never actually went to a prison, but instead spent the remaining 7 ½ months working in the commercial department of the remand centre – hard work but tolerable enough given the reasonable food rations. Dr. Schoenberg’s even managed to put on six pounds during the remaining 7 ½ months. Meanwhile, Dr. Schoenberg’s's wife had contracted jaundice in the camp but did in time recover and was put to work by the Gestapo, first in the sewing-room and then typing up a record of all the Jews who had been “evacuated”. My mother-in-law’s was never interrogated, which was a good thing. Five weeks after the date of the end of Dr. Schoenberg’s's sentence, Herr Bischof saw fit to finally acknowledge My mother-in-law’s's presence and decided: “My mother-in-law’s can be released tomorrow!” However, as My mother-in-law’s had been doing such a good job My mother-in-law’s's Jewish colleagues suggested My mother-in-law’s might want to continue My mother-in-law’s's involvement with the work. Thus My mother-in-law’s stayed until April this year, even when the Thuringia premises were bombed out and the Gestapo were forced to take over rooms in Hamburger Strasse and relocate the camp to the pathological institute of the Jewish Hospital in Schulstrasse. If My mother-in-law’s hadn’t stayed on, My mother-in-law’s would have had to go back to factory work. The work My mother-in-law’s did for the Jews at least had the advantage that My mother-in-law’s could offer all kinds of illicit help to the inmates, despite putting My mother-in-law’s at constant risk of being locked in the bunker by doing so, plus the work was clean and the hours shorter. The awful thing about it, however, was the catalogue of misery that My mother-in-law’s encountered day in day out throughout this period. In the autumn of the previous year after Dr. Schoenberg’s's release from prison, Dr. Schoenberg’s frequently witnessed how dejected My mother-in-law’s was when My mother-in-law’s came home, telling Dr. Schoenberg’s of the desperate cases My mother-in-law’s had come across in My mother-in-law’s's work. Twelve days after Dr. Schoenberg’s's release, we celebrated our silver wedding. Despite the difficulties of travel, Dr. Schoenberg’s's mother and sister came down from Magdeburg. Dr. Schoenberg’s's printing industry bosses, for racist reasons, wanted nothing more to do with Dr. Schoenberg’s, although Dr. Schoenberg’s's direct superior would have liked to keep Dr. Schoenberg’s on. Dr. Schoenberg’s was able to persuade the equally sympathetic head of personnel to delay any decision on Dr. Schoenberg’s's future, which meant at least Dr. Schoenberg’s had a few weeks’ grace. By 1 November, the equally sympathetic head of personnel found Dr. Schoenberg’s a job with the Carl Heymanns publishing house. Dr. Schoenberg’s was really supposed to report to the Labour Office on the day after Dr. Schoenberg’s's release. According to Nazi law, failure to do so could have cost Dr. Schoenberg’s another three to six months in prison for refusing to work. Dr. Schoenberg’s was only in this post for a few days, however, before the Organisation Todt intervened. - 8 - As the Gestapo were not able to put all of us in the concentration camp, the Gestapo had ordered the Labour Office to conscript all Aryan husbands and Mischlinge (i.e. half-Jews) into heavy labour, mostly excavation for OT building companies. Dr. Schoenberg’s was sent to the district of Leuna to work on building anti-aircraft positions; the barracks were situated in Weissenfels, Halle and a village near Lauchstaedt. It was extremely hard, unpleasant work. But, as had been Dr. Schoenberg’s's experience in prison, Dr. Schoenberg’s was lucky enough to be spared the cruel and degrading treatment that drove several of those around Dr. Schoenberg’s to suicide. We were put together with Thuringian workers in the same category, and Dr. Schoenberg’s was part of a small group of extremely educated men, some of whom would ordinarily have held high-ranking positions. In February we were unnerved by news that the Gestapo had suddenly decided to send these men’s wives to Theresienstadt, where they were spared brutal murder - only to die a slow death from malnourishment and exhaustion, a fate we also feared in Berlin – especially as all manner of rumours were already circulating about the Gestapo intentions. But it never happened. When American troops were just 150 km away on the other side of Erkner Dr. Schoenberg’s took a “business trip” to Berlin from which, thanks to Dr. Schoenberg’s's home-coming comrades, Dr. Schoenberg’s would not be forced to return. Dr. Schoenberg’s was clever enough to avoid immediate conscription into forced labour or the Volkssturm, so was at least able to be with Dr. Schoenberg’s's wife during those awful days of the occupation. Throughout those awful days of the occupation our house had only about half of our house's usual residents, around forty people, four of whom – quite understandably - took their own lives. Suicide was extremely common among our people at this time. Dr. Schoenberg’s reckon our apartment has lost our house's windows – or the cardboard used to replace its windows – at least nine times in the past two years. Partition walls have collapsed and been rebuilt, doors ripped out and then, apart from one that was completely destroyed, cobbled back together again. But at least the place is still habitable. Winter will be very hard, with no window panes and no heating. There is also not even the bare minimum of food. What there is is rationed according to five categories: heavy labourers, ordinary labourers, office workers, children, others. Falling into the third category, we receive 400 grams of bread daily, and supplies of 400 grams of bread have come regularly so far. But the situation is very difficult and we have both suffered gall bladder problems. Our daily ration of 400 grams of potatoes was halved for a while, and has occasionally stopped. We also get 10 grams of fat, 40 grams of meat, 20 grams of sugar and 40 grams of grocery items, mostly porridge or rye flour, as well as 100 grams of coffee substitute, 400 grams of salt, 60 grams of coffee and 20 grams of tea. Hopefully, - 9 - supplies of all these items will become more regular than has been the case so far. As a result of transport and other difficulties we have only had vegetables twice a month until now. Other foodstuffs have also been in short supply, i.e. no fish, cheese, fruit, conserves, herrings, alcohol, or anything else you might want. Dr. Schoenberg’s's wife’s normal weight a year ago was around 98 pounds; now My mother-in-law’s weighs just 78 pounds. From weighing 184 pounds at Dr. Schoenberg’s's heaviest Dr. Schoenberg’s have come down to 122 pounds, mostly in the last two years. Dr. Schoenberg’s's business has survived almost intact and Dr. Schoenberg’s have been able to begin trading again, albeit on a smaller scale. In that point, aware that it would have been foolish to expose valuable items to the endless bombing in Berlin, Dr. Schoenberg’s moved all furniture and furnishings, Dr. Schoenberg’s's home library, and several valuable book collections - including the complete French section of the Aryan partner of a mixed marriage (p.1, 3, 7-8)'s library - to the Sudeten Mountains for safe-keeping. As the Sudeten Mountains is now in Polish hands, ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Date : 4 November 1954. 5. Number of pages : 2. 6. Author or Source : Dr. Harry Stern\'s. 7. Recorded by : Kurt Sabatzky. 8. Further References : a) Places : Erfurt b) Individuals : c) Organisations : d) Miscellaneous : As it was the habit the Jewish Community had to pay for the fuel, with which the synagogue was set on fire. Abuse and physical injury – evading an order Payment for arson (Buchenwald) Dr. Harry Stern\'s was a lawyer and notary, a board member of the Jewish Community and president of the B\'nai B\'rith Lodge. Jews had been established in Erfurt since the 12th and 13th century. At the time of the Nazi seizure of power there were around 830 community members. In the night of 8th – 9th November all male Jews between the ages of 18 and 80 were taken. At 2 O’clock at night the bell rang loudly at the Sterns’ home. Three men in plain clothes appeared, apparently drunk, and ordered Dr. Stern, who was wearing pyjamas, to leave with Three men in plain clothes at once. Three men in plain clothes did not want to allow Dr. Harry Stern\'s to change Dr. Harry Stern\'s's clothes. Dr. Harry Stern\'s did however manage to pull on trousers and a top while Three men in plain clothes threw a coat hanging in the hallway over Dr. Harry Stern\'s. Referring to Dr. Harry Stern\'s's shoes Three men in plain clothes said: “Take Dr. Harry Stern\'s's dirty great feet with Dr. Harry Stern\'s!” Dr. Harry Stern\'s took his shoes in Dr. Harry Stern\'s's hand and put his shoes on later in the car, which was waiting below. Dr. Harry Stern\'s was then driven past the synagogue. One of Three men in plain clothes said to Dr. Harry Stern\'s: “That may be Dr. Harry Stern\'s's last moment on Earth!” Dr. Harry Stern\'s was then brought to a sports hall – Dr. Harry Stern\'s believed a sports hall to be that of the Humboldt School. Here there was a terrible noise, partly from blatantly drunk members of the police, SS and SA, and partly from people dressed in plain clothes. “Dr. Harry Stern\'s recognised”, said Dr. Harry Stern\'s, “the police commissioner Biscamp. Dr. Harry Stern\'s's personal belongings were laid out on a table and Dr. Harry Stern\'s was gripped by two men and taken to a wash room. Here there were two SA men with clubs, which were clearly to be used to beat us up with. One of two SA men with clubs, which were clearly to be used to beat us up with raised clubs, which were clearly to be used to beat us up with and touched Dr. Harry Stern\'s with clubs, which were clearly to be used to beat us up with. The other one said: “Shout out as much as Dr. Harry Stern\'s can”, which Dr. Harry Stern\'s did. two SA men with clubs, which were clearly to be used to beat us up with obviously wanted to avoid two SA men with clubs, which were clearly to be used to beat us up with's orders to beat us. Then Dr. Harry Stern\'s was pushed out of a wash room and gripped by other SA men, with Dr. Harry Stern\'s's face pressed against the wall. While doing this Dr. Harry Stern\'s found a great number of other Jews. We had to stand with our knees bent, which was the greatest torture Dr. Harry Stern\'s have ever endured. Among the people who were abused, Dr. Harry Stern\'s saw the businessmen Duhlan and Gottschalk. Many of the SA members enjoyed torturing and inflicting the abuse on us. - 2 - […] amused himself by burning the people standing with the people's knees bent in the neck with a cigarette. Some of the Nazis specially picked out Jews Some of the Nazis knew personally to vent Some of the Nazis's anger on Jews they knew personally. The baptised lawyer Flesch was particularly tormented and insulted by an SA man, against whom The baptised lawyer Flesch had acted in a divorce case before a court. Without taking any consideration of age or physical condition, a large number of Jews had to climb up the fixed ladders in a sports hall. the Nazis were standing underneath with horsewhips, and the Nazis lashed out with the Nazis as long as the people on the fixed ladders in the sports hall were within reach. There were always new people being brought in, some of whom were streaming with blood, like the lawyer Karl Heilbrunn and the lawyer Rudnicki, who had had an eye beaten out. Many people were wearing pyjamas. We had to line up, and after the whines of the Horst Wessel song, march around. Then we were commanded to shout out “death to the Jews!” which we had to do. We had to line up, and after the whines of the Horst Wessel song, march around. Then we were commanded to shout out “death to the Jews!” which we had to do. We had to run around the roll-call square, while Kerle came behind us and hit us with whips and sticks. Many people came away from this with bloody heads. We stood for the whole day without food and without anyone taking basic care of us. SS men came back and forth. One of SS men said about us: “One criminal’s mug like another!” We did not know where we could answer nature’s call and when we asked we were given a slap round the face, or a slap round the face was answered with dirty remarks. Once it had got dark, we were chased into a barrack, without having had anything to eat. This was later given out here. Here we got some help from imprisoned Jews, who came from Vienna and had already been in the camp for a longer time. We lay on the floor or on plank beds without any sheets or blankets. In the first nights we continuously heard multiple screams and shots. In the morning we found out that people were being killed. From the prisoners of Erfurt, the businessman Gassenheimer (Joseph) was so weakened that after being released the businessman Gassenheimer (Joseph) died at home. The Jewish women’s union of Erfurt had set up an aid centre at the station in Weimer for the so-called “Aktionsjude” who had been released, which provided the so-called “Aktionsjude” who had been released with warm drinks and provisions. For those who had no money an aid centre at the station in Weimer for the so-called “Aktionsjude” who had been released, which provided them with warm drinks and provisions also provided fare money and essential money for the journey. In the camp, on many occasions the collection of money which went through SS for those in need to make those in need to make their journey home's journey home was never paid out.” - 3 - P.S. In Erfurt, the community leader R. A. Felix Meyer and a few other prominent members of the community had to clean the sports hall after the night of the November Pogrom (9 November 1938) in Erfurt. the community had to bear the cost of clearing away the rubble of the synagogue, which was about 40 years old. The community secretary, Dr. jur. Wallach, found out from the bill that the community also had to pay for two barrels of benzene with which the synagogue, which was about 40 years old was set on fire.” Prohibition of lodge - panel doctors - agricultural trading. ""Protective custody"" after acquittal. In that time Dr. Harry Stern\'s was president of the lodge. In this or the next year our Erfurt B\'nai B\'rith Lodge was prohibited – earlier than the other B\'nai B\'rith Lodges. The Odd Fellow lodge was already universally this order at that time. It is possible that the Erfurt chief of police had misunderstood this order when the Erfurt chief of police dissolved the Erfurt lodge. The assets were seized without us later finding anything out about it. Jewish panel doctors in Erfurt who had fought in the German military or older doctors, were unlawfully excluded. The medical department of the Berlin area had raised ideas on this matter in Weimar. Erfurt was a centre point for Thuringia. Although Thuringia was not constitutionally part of Thuringia, Thuringia was part of the administrative district of the National Socialist German Worker’s Party (NSDAP). Since there was not an at that time formally an “Aryan Clause” (Arierparagrah) excluding Jews from agricultural trading, the relevant officials dismissed Jews as “apolitical”, meaning that Jews were unreliable, thereby excluding Jews. As a result there was severe hardship throughout Thuringia. If Jews were acquitted in criminal trials, the Gestapo came along afterwards and took those concerned into “protective custody”.

 Paris ,"['The author and The author's husband, having lived in hiding in Warsaw for some time after the German invasion, went voluntarily into the Ghetto. The author and her husband stayed in the “poor sector”. The author's description of life in the Ghetto agrees with other accounts. The author mentions one point which is not widely known: “Aryan” Poles were able to visit the Ghetto for business purposes. The author witnessed the murder of Jewish children by German guards, and a young couple being beaten with a whip by a German soldier until a young couple were dead. The author and The author's husband escaped from the Ghetto shortly before the rising and survived “illegally” in Warsaw. Life in the Ghetto Life had been so pleasant in the small town near Kattowitz. The author and her husband had a large factory, The author's husband was a superb engineer, who loved her husband's work and was well respected. her husband was valued by her husband's colleagues and brought home a good salary. The author and her husband lived in a twelve room house, a twelve room house was tastefully decorated and pleasant, had a large garden, nice friends....The author and her husband, were happy with The author and her husband's lot, and the only shadow over The author and her husband's lives was that The author and her husband had earlier lost The author and her husband's only, dearly loved child under tragic circumstances. 1939 ! The Germans invade Poland. That was the end of The author and her husband's dream world. The author and her husband asked The author and her husband: Will The author and her husband be safe and secure, in this small place, where everyone knows The author and her husband? Far from it. And so The author and her husband decided to leave everything behind and attempted to go into hiding in Warsaw. One evening The author and her husband drove The author and her husband's car to The author and her husband's relatives in Warsaw. The author and her husband had brought with The author and her husband only the bare essentials in terms of clothing, because there wasn’t much space for suitcases in The author and her husband's car. Would The author and her husband ever see The author and her husband's factory, The author and her husband's lovely house again? The author's husband was advised to leave Warsaw and to make her husband's own way to Lemberg. People thought that men would be safer there. The author and her husband could no longer exchange The author and her husband's money and this and other hardships made The author's husband fall ill. There was an ever greater danger of being deported to Astrakhan - 2 - and Jews were no longer able to go into hiding in Warsaw. The constant house searches were too unnerving and so The author went into the Ghetto of The author's own free will, The author's husband joined The author there soon after. her husband's brother, who had been with His brother, who had been with him in Lemberg in Lemberg, was deported to Siberia and died there of nervous exhaustion and hunger. There were two ghettos in Warsaw, a small and modern one, in which the more wealthy Jews, who had managed to exchange the more wealthy Jews, who had managed to exchange their own flat for one of a similar value in the ghetto's own flat for one of a similar value in the ghetto, lived; the other one was a squalid ghetto, which was separated from the first one by a sort of arched doorway. The author's brother had a good three room flat in this better part, but The author and her husband lived in the other sector together with friends and relatives. The author and her husband lived there for two horrendous years, three, four or often five people together in a single room. Compared to many other people The author and her husband's own circumstances were bearable, because The author and her husband often got parcels of food, which an American niece sent to The author and her husband via Poland. The fact that parcels of food, which an American niece sent to us via Portugal didn’t always contain goods that corresponded to parcels of food, which an American niece sent to us via Portugal's true value was certainly not The author's niece’s fault, but rather that of unscrupulous business people. The author and her husband often received other parcels as well, which a female Aryan friend, who was able to enter the ghetto by car because a female Aryan friend, who was able to enter the ghetto had business to do there, had assigned to The author and her husband. Toiletries, medicines, as The author have mentioned already, The author and her husband were fortunate compared to others who had none of Toiletries, medicines. The children had it hardest of all, The children suffered most from The children's unlawful detention. - 3 - The children tried to get out through the small channels which ran throughout the ghetto, in order to get something to eat. If the Germans, who used to guard the ghetto dressed as civilians, caught The children, the Germans, who used to guard the ghetto dressed as civilians would bash the heads of The children against the wall until The children dropped dead. The author witnessed that from The author's window with The author's own eyes. And The author also saw how a German soldier whipped a young man and a young man's girl friend until a young man and his girl friend were dead. It is likely that the only sin a young man and his girl friend were guilty of was that a young man and his girl friend were Jews. There was a hospital, there was even a cake shop, where they used to play music. But it was only young people who were keen on any distraction from all these horrors, we, older people, scarcely ventured out. The Jewish authorities purchased everything from the Germans, who of course demanded high prices. Only the very fewest of we, older people could manage to pay high prices and those, who had no friends or relatives, starved to death. A lot of people were working, in factories, in businesses. Women sewed, gave lessons, helped the better off around the house... If you didn’t look Jewish, you could even leave the ghetto in secret. The author would sometimes spend a few days with The author's relatives, but because The Germans carried out house searches on each occasion, in order to find The author's brother’s son, The author chose the lack of freedom in the ghetto over the excitement and freedom of the outside world. - 4 - There was a courthouse at the far end of the ghetto, half Christian and half Jewish, guarded by Polish and Jewish policemen. You could meet friends and family there and get yourself smuggled out, once you had hidden your armband with its Star of David, which all Jews had to wear, in your pocket. At the start of The author's stay in the ghetto The author made use of the fact that The author didn’t look at all Jewish, and spent a few days in the houses of The author's friends or relatives. But the sight of the Germans, who were in charge everywhere, the constant fear of being discovered and the sight of the many atrocities, made The author and her husband view the ghetto as a haven of peace, and The author and her husband waited until The author's Aryan girl friend was finally able to acquire some forged papers, in order, two years later, to secretly leave the ghetto through a courthouse at the far end of the ghetto, half Christian and half Jewish, guarded by Polish and Jewish policemen, just before the uprising. The author had lost nearly twenty pounds in weight during this period and The author's husband died soon thereafter, the excitement and deprivation had been more than His brother, who had been with him in Lemberg's poor health could bear. The author lived on The author's own in Warsaw, hidden in a cellar and The author's friends brought The author The author's food. In 1947 The author went to see The author's brother in Breslau and in 1949 The author obtained permission to come to Poland. The author now live here with The author's Aryan girl friend, who has done so much for The author, and whom The author have to thank The author's life for. ']", his name was Pechard.When she was having lunch with the stranger from her compartment in the dining car later on, he gave her the following explanation: “ You really do have a meeting in Berlin, but we arranged that you had to take this train because I need to talk to you. I was the General Consul in Paris, and my suits are still there. The former French General Consul has his in Berlin. Naturally we both want to get our property back and exchange the suits. We thought that you might make this exchange for us.” Frau W. replied : “ I only work with children, not with suits.” This reply was her good fortune because they had wanted to trap her with this transaction. He seemed to be an influential man in the movement. She overheard a conversation between officers that he was at that time General Consul in the Foreign Ministry in Berlin. These gentlemen also related that on 28th August Germans crossed the Polish border and stole huge amounts. When they found that the countries were not yet at war, they realised their mistake and returned after two days. At 4 o’clock Dr. Paul Eppstein awaited her at the Zoo Station. When he inquired after her luggage, she told him that she had only brought a handbag with a toothbrush and a nightshirt. He escorted her to the hotel, but had to remain outside as he was forbidden to enter. Frau W. was the first guest who stayed there on account of the Jews. The receptionist welcomed her by name, asked when she wished to have a massage or have her hair done and where her luggage - 11 - was. “At the railway station, but I do not want it collected as yet because I do not know how long I will be staying.” She was given a large suite with bathroom. In the street she met up with Herr Eppstein again . He warned her to watch what she was saying and not to telephone. At the meeting, a Gestapo official would be present, she should however not show that she had been warned. Frau W. bought cigarettes for Herr Eppstein because, as a Jew, he was no longer permitted to do so.The meeting began. The Danish Government had sent a letter to the German Government that Denmark wanted to take Jewish children. However, children who had been selected for a Youth-Aliyah-Transport had to be brought out first. It was requested that Frau W. took on the Youth-Aliyah-Transport. A Gestapo official was present and declared that Frau W. would not receive permission to cross German soil with Jewish children. At this discussion a Miss Springer was also present. Because of these new problems, Frau W. demanded to fly to Copenhagen . She needed a plane ticket immediately. This could be arranged for the following day. As she had no money, she got the hotel porter to order the ticket , the Jews would pay for it. She then went to have dinner in a Chinese restaurant with Herr Eppstein as this was the only place where he could still eat with a foreigner. The following day Miss Springer collected her from the hotel; when she arrived at the office of the airline company, Frau W. was handed a beautiful orchid. On leaving the office she was filmed. They were making a propaganda film. Now she went to the Tempelhof airport. The flight was terrible. Because of the technicalities of war, they had to fly very low.Frau Oppenheimer of the Youth Aliyah in Copenhagen collected her from the airport. On the way to the passport control she learnt that the Dutch now required a visa for landing. They wanted to send her back to Berlin. Thanks to the objection by Herr De Jong, the representative of KLM in Denmark, she was allowed to enter the country after all. Herr De Jong vouched for her, and she was given a visa for 3 months. Frau Oppenheim had reserved a room for her at the Hotel Angleterre. “Where is your luggage?” “I don’t have any.” Frau O. advised her not to say so at the hotel but to pretend that she had left it at Frau O’s flat, otherwise she would not be given a room.In her coat pocket, Frau W. found the card of young Mr. Pechard. It turned out that he was the son of the General Consul of a South American country. She called him, but this created unprecedented problems for her. On the train she had told him that she was travelling to Berlin, and now she had arrived in Denmark almost at the same moment as he. The General Consul thought that she was an agent and informed the Foreign Police. With the help of Frau Oppenheimer, this incident could also be solved and everything ran smoothly again. She met up with young Mr. Pechard who would help her often and extensively and who would later visit her in Holland. - 12 - She now discussed with the committee that she wanted to try and bring 56 Danish children to Amsterdam on KLM, from there by train via Paris to Marseilles and there put them on a boat. If this transport succeeded, Denmark would have room for the next group of children. Frau Wijsmuller flew back to Berlin, explained how she would try to organise the project , stayed the night in Berlin and travelled back to Amsterdam the following day. She knew that it would be difficult to get the Visas for the German children as they had to cross Belgium and France by train. In November 1939 , after learning what Frau W. had suggested for the Youth Aliyah in Denmark, the Amsterdam contingent asked her to do a Youth Aliyah transport from Holland first. Here, too, German Jewish children were concerned, although there were also a few Dutch ones. Now Mr. Pechard helped her. He arranged a contact with the Foreign Office in Paris for her. She negotiated successfully with a Mr. L’Homme and returned to Amsterdam. A man came from Palestine to bring the necessary certificates for the children . Together they undertook this first transport for the Dutch Youth Aliyah. Frau W. had arranged for them to stay overnight in Paris at Hotel Terminus and intended to make the same arrangement for Marseilles where she knew another Hotel Terminus. However the Amsterdam office had already booked a hotel for them and told her not to trouble herself further about the accommodation in Marseilles. Everything went well in Paris. On arrival in Marseilles she was received by a young Arab who was the owner of the “hotel”. It turned out that the hotel was no such thing but a homeless shelter which charged only 10 francs per night. Frau W. and the man from Palestine were shocked when they inspected the premises. There were many Arabs in the shelter. She was worried about the safety of the children entrusted to her and decided that the boys should share the girls’ dormitories. Frau W. then asked the owner where her own room was . He replied coldly: “ You are sleeping in my room!” Needless to say that Frau W. asked her Palestinian colleague to book a room in a proper hotel for her. She took the money and the children’s passport with her for safekeeping over night. The next morning she collected the children and took them to the boat without any problems. On the way back to Holland, she took the opportunity in Paris to arrange a travel permit and also permission for the Danish group. At the same time she ensured that on future visits they would stay at Hotel Terminus in Marseilles. - 13 - The second transport took place in November 39, around the 10th. This time Frau W. had no adult companion. She had 25 children for Palestine, one for Shanghai and one for Naples. She prepared the travel arrangements with Cooks. Saturday night they arrived in Marseilles where they were collected by a representative of Cooks Ltd. He informed her that ships to Shanghai were no longer permitted to go from Marseilles but from Genoa. She considered that it would be best to leave the children on their own in Hotel Terminus on Sunday so that she could take the two single cases personally to the Italian border. As she herself had no visa for Italy, she had to ask the 16 year old boy from Naples to deliver the Shanghai child to the Jewish Committee in Genoa who had been alerted by her to the situation. She asked the boy to send her a telegram when he had accomplished the mission. Monday evening she received the following telegram: Erika tres bon, Elizabeth autre route , ERIKA DANS TRIESTE PAR ISABELLE. Erika was the name of the little girl who was travelling to Shanghai. At 6 a.m. the following morning Frau W. took the 25 children to the boat and got ready to fly straight to Paris. As her train departed at 11 pm, she would be able to take the night train to Holland. The airport of Marseilles is situated approximately 30 km from the city. On the journey from the airport she was seized with a feeling of anxiety. On arrival, she was arrested by two men and imprisoned in a small cell. Two armed soldiers were with her inside the cell and several more stood guard outside. She did not learn the reason for her arrest. By 1 o’clock she had not eaten anything and asked if she might get some food. Two armed soldiers accompanied her to the airport restaurant. As they opened the door to the restaurant, they shouted loudly: “Ladies and gentlemen, this woman is highly dangerous!” Frau W. thought it wise to eat and drink copiously as she did not know when she would have another opportunity. Then she was returned to her cell. She noticed a handcart in her cell and asked , as the weather was fine, if she could take it outside and sleep in it. This is how she slept until 3.30, then she went back into the cell. Two French sailors now entered her cell, addressed her in German and kept repeating: “At last we have Erika!” They threw Frau W. from one side to the other side of the room , broke her glasses and tore her handbag. She asked them:”Why are you speaking German to me?” “Ha, that’s your mother tongue.” They ordered a police car which took her via Marseilles to a small island where the infamous prison of Marseilles is located. Again she was locked in a cell and told : “ Once you are in here, you never get out.”After an hour she was collected for an interrogation with two gentlemen. This interrogation was again in German. Her protestations that she was Dutch were rebuffed with the accusation that she was lying. Her passport must be a forgery and Feigne where she crossed the border between Belgium and Holland was German. - 14 - A gentleman appeared who spoke French. He declared that he believed that a mistake had been made. He had talked to Cook’s, he had instigated a search of Frau W.’s suitcase at Hotel Terminus, and in his opinion the wrong woman had been arrested. Frau W. apparently only organised children’s transports , her name was not Erika and she was no German spy. He thought that, as he spoke in French, Frau W. would not be able to follow the conversation. She was now shown a copy of the telegram and asked what it meant. Frau W. replied that, if she could have her papers back, she would be able to show them the list containing both the name Erika and that of the boy from Naples. At that she was set free.During the interrogation, Frau Wijsmuller had been constantly threatened that the “Admiral” was in the building and that he had a lot of evidence against her. She now demanded that the Admiral came to her and apologised to her in person. She also wanted to know how she was to get back into town. If the Admiral did not wish to see her, she would make the whole story public. She was told that a police car would take her back into town. Frau W. demanded to be driven back in the Admiral’s car in the company of his adjutant who should then come into the hotel and there clarify the error. The Admiral did come, apologised and begged her to keep quiet about the matter. One of his officers who had participated in the interrogation would accompany her in the Admiral’s car. On the journey she told him : “ If you have to do something for your country, it would be advisable for you to learn the stations and borders first. Feigne is not German. I am sorry for you that that I am not this Erika, otherwise you might be promoted to admiral now. This way your chances are small.” The officer was so incensed that he jumped out of the car and ordered the chauffeur to go into the hotel to deliver the Admiral’s apology. Again, as so often, she had to telegraph home to say that she was arriving a day later. The hotel porter told her that, during the investigations, her work for the children had been discussed. He also advised her to take the night train to Paris which was leaving in 10 minutes’ time in order to get some peace at last. When she entered the Danish restaurant in Paris to have some lunch, she coincidentally met Mister Pechard there. She asked him to notify Marseilles and explain once more who she was. The day after her return to Holland Frau W. had to embark on a new journey. The destination was Frankfort. A little girl, Ilse Bauer, was to be adopted in Aruba on the Dutch West Indies, and to this purpose the child had to be collected and taken to the boat in Holland. For two days, little Ilse would stay in her own house in Amsterdam. Then Frau W. and her husband went with the child to the steamer “Simon Bolivar”. Frau W. had severe premonitions that usually came to pass. On stepping on board, she felt that something would happen to the boat. She approached the purser, told him of her premonition and wanted the child to - 15 - be taken off the passenger list. Herr Leid of the shipping company, who happened to be present, and the purser asked Herr Wijsmuller to please come into the small parlour with his wife and to eat and drink something. His wife seemed to them a little stressed and perhaps she would calm down after having a snack. Also they would urge them not to let the staff hear such talk. Frau W. allowed herself to be persuaded to let the child continue the journey. The family of Engineer Westermann , who also travelled on this ship with their own child, was asked by Frau W. to look after little Ilse and for one of the parents to remain with her should anything untoward happen on the way. She did not confide her fears to them. In the very first night after departure , the boat was torpedoed , Ilse Bauer spent a long time in the water and was taken to a hospital in London where she had to remain for 6 months. The child was only 2 ½. Nothing happened to the Westermann child. When Ilse was released from hospital, Frau W. unexpectedly received a call from the K.L.M. to be at the airport at such and such a time because that was when Ilse Bauer would be arriving in Holland, and would Frau W. please accommodate her. Again Frau W. took Ilse into her own home . It was arranged that Ilse would join a B.P.M. transport of 75 people to Aruba. One had to take the train to Lisbon. Friends of distant acquaintances were going on this journey, so Frau W. asked them to take Ilse with them to Lisbon. They agreed on condition that they would have the fare for their entire family paid in exchange. Of course, Frau W. refused this deal. The family’s reaction was: Not everybody is as crazy as to do everything for the Jews without compensation whilst living on the third floor. (Frau W. lived on the third floor). After discussion with the tour guide, Frau W. took the child herself across the Spanish border where other people took charge of her. On 8th May 1940 Ilse Bauer finally managed to start her emigration.Frau Wijsmuller also took many children to Herr Troper in Paris (Joint). Early in January 1940, she travelled to Denmark with 56 transit visas for children. (As soon as the children left, Denmark would be able to take more children from Berlin to fill the 56 vacated places.) She chartered 2 airplanes and flew from Copenhagen on 6th January. She travelled via Amsterdam, Paris, Marseilles. There she put the children on the steamer. She also led several Belgian transports. She often had to travel to Germany for the Holland-America-Line. The official of the Holland-America-Line could not cope on his own if the people emigrating to America had problems with customs. This is why Frau W. travelled to Bentheim at the border and accompanied these people to Rotterdam to help them with any occurring difficulties. For all this work she never got paid. In November 1939 Frau Wijsmuller received a letter from Herr Sperling , the manager of the travel agency “Salzkammer” in Kalverstr. 101, - 16 - Amsterdam, with the request to visit him in his office. Frau W. knew that he was the leader of the Fifth Column. For this reason, she notified the police of her envisaged visit and asked them to watch out if she left safely. A short time before, she had seen a film in Paris in which people had been kidnapped in America and taken away on German steamers. Although this film was not based on a true story, she knew that reality was not that far from it. The agreed time was 6.30 ( when nobody else was in the office)and that was when she went to see Herr Sperling. The conversation ran as follows: “ Take a seat. Are you the lady of the Jewish transports? Why are you doing this?” “ If I look at you closely, it seems to me entirely possible that during or after WW1 you came to Holland on a Kindertransport. My father and my mother were on this committee.” “I know that you have two passports.” “That is correct. One of them is needed for Holland, the other for the other countries, England, France, etc.” “We are convinced that you do not take money or gifts ; we have tried often enough. (The Gestapo had tried repeatedly.) I want to make a proposition. You are the only woman in the whole world who is persona grata with us as well as in England and France. Next time you come back from England or France, you could tell us what you observed there. We will, of course, not expect you to do so for nothing.” While he was speaking, he opened a drawer , took out a most beautiful piece of jewellery which he placed in front of him and played with as if absentmindedly, moving it back and forth in her direction – but carefully so that one could not have accused him of anything. “Herr Sperling, if I were to do this for you, it would be entirely possible that I was doing it also for England and France. What use would that be for the world?” At this, Herr Sperling became furious and asked :”You are so well-dressed. Who pays for your clothes?” Frau Wijsmuller just left.The next day she went to a friend, the German banker Koenig. His partner was Herr Flescher. She told them about the incident with Herr Sperling. Herr Flescher responded to this:”Frau W., you speak so little German, I am sure that you misunderstood the situation. I know that Herr Sperling wanted to have discussions with you. This concerned German children whom we want to bring back to Germany from England. “ He promised to find out the truth from Herr Sperling and to let her know the result of this conversation. A few days later she received a letter from the German consulate that her visa had nearly expired, but before a new one could be issued she would have to document her ancestry. She sent in the required documents and received a new visa. Herr Flescher then telephoned her and asked her to see him. When she got there, he declared that everything was exactly as he had thought. She had misunderstood Herr Sperling. Herr Sperling had been completely puzzled by her reaction, having asked her most kindly to collect the children. He had now obtained the names of 2 children whom he begged her to collect from England. One of the names was Ursula Etscheid, 18 years, daughter of an SS Major in Berlin. This girl was at a school in London when war broke out and was now unable - 17 - to return home. The other child was not even one year old and was the child of an employee at the travel agency. The return of Ursula Etscheid was of the highest importance to him. He dismissed her with the words: “ Now you can start your work.” Firstly Frau Wijsmuller approached the French and English Military Attaches after discussions with the respective consulates that had directed her there. She told them exactly what had occurred. They were both grateful for her honesty and they both promised to do everything in their power to help her transport the children.Through corresponding with the Quakers in London, she received the message that Ursula Etscheid did not wish to return to Germany. In February Frau W. travelled to London to talk to the young girl. Ursula explained that she was engaged to a Jew and therefore did not want to leave London. Frau W. made it crystal clear to her that she had to go home as her refusal could endanger the entire rescue operation of the Jews. “If you don’t, I will make sure that you will be expelled from England.” In response, Ursula promised to return but did not do so straightaway.In April Frau Wijsmuller received a telegram from Ursula asking her to please collect her from the airport at Amsterdam. In the meantime she had had a letter from Herr Flescher saying how ineffectual she was as the child had still not arrived. Now Herr Flescher accompanied her to the airport saying she should leave the child to him, he would organise her onward journey. When Ursula arrived, she took one look at Herr Flescher and whispered to Frau W.:” Leave the man to me.” Ursula was badly dressed. She immediately asked Herr Flescher to buy her some clothes, she could not run around like this. Also, she was hungry and needed to eat something decent. In response, Herr Flescher took her to the “Bonnetrie”, the most expensive store in Amsterdam, and obtained clothes for her there. In addition he looked after all her needs. Sunday morning at 10, Frau Wijsmuller received a phone call from Herr Flescher, he had to speak to her urgently. When she appeared, Flescher told her that Ursula had to cross the border the next day. She had gone to his wife and had told her that he had bought her nice clothes and had slept with her. It was now up to Frau W. to get the child out immediately , or else she herself would never be allowed to step on German soil. First of all she had to find Ursula as she had left the hotel. Frau W. found her at the home of Jewish acquaintances who were related to Ursula’s fiance. With the help of the Dutch police she really succeeded in getting Ursula across the border. Now Frau W. got her German visa back and was able to continue her aid work for the Jews. As the English Quakers had paid for Ursula’s ticket, she had to send £8 to England, but was not compensated by Herr Flescher until 8th May. - 18 - The Viennese transports went via Frankfort by express train. In 1939 the Germans insisted that the children were only permitted to travel on ordinary trains. Frau W. approached the Gestapo in Frankfort and applied for permission to use the express trains. The relevant official would only grant this permission if she were to take gold from Germany to Holland for him and to store it for him. Frau Wijsmuller naturally refused this offer. After spending the evening with a Higher Gestapo Officer having dinner and attending the opera, she succeeded in getting the permission to use the express trains. In Vienna there were three committees in charge of Kindertransports, the Jewish Community, the Quakers and the Guild-Masters. Members of the Guild-Masters tried repeatedly to give Frau W. items to keep safe for them in Holland. During one of her transports Vienna-Berlin-Holland, the control in Berlin was particularly exacting and they would not believe that she had nothing with her. Customs officials insisted that they had been informed that she was carrying forbidden goods. Fortunately this was not the case, but in future Frau W. would not talk to these members of the Guild-Masters again.I would like to give an example of her detailed work. The director of Lever Brothers in Holland asked Frau W. to collect a child for him from Vienna whose father, a physician, was already in America. The child was living with her mother in Vienna. At the airport in Vienna the child was handed over. This 3 year old girl looked inside Frau W.’s handbag and remarked:” You are a lady and you don’t have a lipstick?” On arrival in Berlin they passed through Customs, and Frau W. stated she had nothing to declare. The child carried the empty case of a camera. “Don’t you have a camera?” “No.” Whereupon the child interjected:”But I do have one.” That was totally untrue, but it led to a lengthy examination. Frau W. had not been able to obtain an entrance visa for Holland for the child . All the time she had to overcome problems of this nature. With the help of another passenger, Herr Mille, she succeeded in smuggling the child in. She took the child to her own apartment where she had to battle with renewed fads, be it the food, a migraine or similar matters. This continued at Frau Hartog’s who sent for the little girl on the following day. Of course, the motivation for her behaviour lay much deeper than the usual naughtiness of a three year old child e.g. she was sent shopping with the maid and declared : “Jewish children are not allowed into shops.” In response she was given her own money in a purse and allowed to buy something for herself. Soon the child was ruling the entire Hartog house , owners and staff, and Frau Hartog begged Frau W. to help immediately. The father in America was contacted who instigated that Frau Hartog organised the travel documents for the onward journey to America as soon as possible. Until her departure, the child was accommodated at the gardener’s home. This - 19 - was a suggestion by Frau Wijsmuller and proved to be the best solution. In November 1945, Frau W. met Frau Hartog again in London where she had been able to flee to safety in May 40, and she was delighted not only to see photographs of the child but to hear that she had developed into a wonderful human being. The Dutch Jewish Committee received 200 visas for immigration into Chile in November 39. It was hoped that Frau W., together with Herr Deutz, would take 200 children to Spain and there put them on Italian boats. It was impossible for Frau W. to go away for so long , but she undertook the organisation as far as Rotterdam. Also in the year 39 , Frau W. prepared an illegal ship for the journey to Palestine. The Greek steamer “Dora” was to take 500 passengers . The harbour police did not want to give permission for departure as the ship had not been built for such a large number of people. Frau W. went to the steamer with the harbour police and demonstrated that one could create sufficient space for 500 people and so she achieved their permission. Together with her husband she brought the people on board at night. The Socialist newspaper “Het Volk” printed a photograph the next morning, entitled: This is how people are dragged aboard. By chance, Herr Wijsmuller was recognisable in the picture as he was supporting a woman with a heavy rucksack. Sufficient evidence for the untruth of the accusation. In Antwerp a few more people came on board, and the ship arrived safely – despite illegality – in Palestine. In March 1940, Frau Wijsmuller was notified that there were in Stockholm 56 children from Riga , Estonia, who had certificates and who were to be taken to Palestine for the Youth Aliyah. Would Frau W. please come and organise the transport? The KLM donated her flight to Riga. On arrival there, she found another 100 people who had valid papers for Palestine but no permits for the passage. She travelled to Stockholm and had a discussion with Fritz Warburg in the Grand Hotel. He explained to her that there were still families in Riga , about 100 people, who needed to be transported. She was not entirely trusted. For this reason, Frau W. phoned Paris and spoke to Mr. L’Homme . He called the Ambassador in Stockholm who then got everything organised , including the permission to take the extra 100 people. She now arranged with KLM to fly 7 planes from Malmoe, where she travelled by train. In Amsterdam, a few more children boarded. The local French Ambassador gave her as much assistance as he could. Now Herr Warburg asked her to look after some more children from Riga for whom he could obtain certificates. Frau W. was well aware of the danger of this situation and first of all sought the advice of Rabbi Ehrenpreis. After consultations with both gentlemen , she ordered planes for the transports from the Swedish airline , but had to pay for the journeys out and back. At the beginning of 1940 Frau W. was called to Brussels to Herr Troper of the Joint in Paris. Two members of the Joint staff had been attacked and taken by a German U-boat whilst travelling on a Swedish steamer. - 20 - Frau W. was to try and get them freed. After discussions with the Germans she succeeded in this undertaking. It was a real joy for Frau W. to meet one of the gentlemen again in 1955 when he appeared at a claims conference in Holland.Despite all her great successes Frau W. heard in Amsterdam that the local committee still had its doubts about her trustworthiness, whether she was really taking these people to Marseilles. She went to the airline office in Stockholm and spoke to Director Dr. Bergmann. Herr Warburg was waiting for her outside the office. She explained to Dr. Bergmann that the 7 planes were purely for the children from Riga and that she wanted to hire more planes from him in future in order to transport more children from there. The director asked her if she was from the travel agency Holland and what % she was getting. She answered in the negative. Meanwhile a gentleman from a travel agency had joined them and had listened to their conversation. Now he started to ask extra questions. “How much does it cost for 7 planes? What kind of children are these?” “Jewish ones”. “Our Hermann does not permit this.” “Who is our Herrmann?” “Our Herrmann is Goering.” “He is a German. Is this a German company – I thought it was Swedish?” “No, no, we are a Swedish business. But let us discuss the business aspects. We cannot give you planes to collect the children.” Frau W. succeeded in hiring 7 planes for a specific sum. The personnel had to be paid extra , but she could not get petrol from them. So she asked how much petrol was needed and the cost of that. “You require 80,000 litres.” “When can I have the planes?” “Tomorrow at 9.30.” It was by now 4.30 p.m. She asked for all the promises to be given in writing. She immediately informed Herr Warburg of her discussions and they considered together how to proceed. Herr Warburg advised her to go to Prince Karl, the director of the Swedish Red Cross, but first she would have to approach his secretary, a Baron ... Herr Warburg drove her to this Baron and again waited for her outside. The Baron listened to her wishes and asked her to return at 5.30. On her return, he gave her a certified note that she was to receive 80,000 litres of petrol from the Swedish Red Cross. With this note she happily went back to Herr Warburg . He gave a big reception in her honour that evening to which Prof. Ehrenpreis and many prominent Jews were invited. The following morning Frau W. went back to the airline officials with her note for the petrol. They were not exactly enthusiastic that she had achieved this and asked her how she had done it. “Oh, I have connections to the King,” was her only reply. At last the planes went off to Riga. This was the last transport that collected children from Riga. Altogether there were about 150 people, of whom approximately 56 children. On the night train, they travelled - 21 - to Malmoe. Frau W. was tired out, took a sleeping compartment for herself and soon sank into a deep sleep. When she was woken up in the morning, all her papers had disappeared, passport, permit, money etc. There she stood with her 150 proteges. The Swedish police refused to let her continue her journey without her papers. The planes were standing there waiting. The man in charge of these planes, a Dutchman, Herr Evert van Dyk, told the police:” “This is our Frau Wijsmuller; you can rest assured that anything she says is trustworthy.” Upon this, the police telephoned Holland to ask if she could be believed. The Dutch police ensured the continuation of her journey. Her passport contained a permanent visa for England, France, Sweden and Denmark. Her passport contained a permanent visa for England, France, Sweden and Denmark. The only thing she can add today to this strange tale is that at the end of November 1940 when she was in the camp at Gurs and , as usual, sat with the permanently drunk camp director, he uttered the following words:” I can’t understand how we came to have a German spy in the camp who had the same name as you and a passport with all the necessary papers in your name.” That is all Frau W. knows about the theft until this day. The planes at that time were relatively small. They took off, but after a short while, at 12.30, they landed again in Malmoe. Herr van Dyk came to her with the news that the airport Schiphol in Amsterdam was closed because of a snowstorm and that it was advisable to wait until tomorrow, but as the leader, she had to make this decision. Frau W. put the question what would happen if the flight was to go ahead. “Very dangerous”. She decided to allow the flights to go ahead , but with her in the plane that was to land first. They landed at 3.30, and all the landings took place without any difficulties. The Dutch police awaited Frau W. at the airport with a new passport. Of the Jewish Committee, Herr Frank was present in order to assist her. He had buses waiting that would take the new arrivals to their reserved hotels. The 56 children were taken to Elem (Salvation Army). All the other travellers were destined for a hotel near the central railway station. The Aliens Police collected all the passports and promised to return them to Frau W. the following day when all the people had arrived at the train to Paris they were due to take. The Aliens Police accompanied her to confirm at the hotel that they had the passports of all the guests. At this point, the buses left. Suddenly the police discovered that 11 people were missing. How was it possible? When all the people had been boarded onto the buses, these 11 passengers had boarded a bus from the Amstelhotel which happened to stand at the airport. The Amstelhotel is the most expensive hotel in - 22 - Amsterdam. Frau W. had to go there with the Aliens Police, but the people were allowed to stay there as they had sufficient money to pay their bill. The Aliens Police impressed upon them the need to be at the train punctually at 10 the next day. It turned out that these people were the chairmen of the Community in Warsaw. Frau Wijsmuller went to Elem to eat supper with the children. Suddenly she received a call from the Aliens Police. The 11 passengers at the Amstelhotel had lodged a complaint against her with the President of the Police that she had taken away their passports. As a consequence, the President of the police had asked the Aliens Police what was to be done with Frau W. if she was capable of such conduct. Of course, the Aliens Police had explained the true situation to the President of the Police and that they had the passports. So this reinstated their trust in Frau W. , and she was given permission to add some Dutch families to the transport , amongst them the Tietz Family who had lived “underground” in Holland, and others in prison who had certificates for Palestine. For herself, Frau W. also received the necessary visas in her passport. The next morning, everybody was at the station as requested. Unfortunately, the Polish group again caused problems. The train had two new reserved carriages for them in third class. The Poles did not want to travel together with the others and wanted to be in first class. But that was not permitted. They tried to get on at the front and then get off at the back. In the meantime, the transport consisted of about 180 people, and Frau W. was the only accompanying person. For this reason, the police and the Aliens police told Frau W. that they would telephone the police in the Hague and in Rotterdam to alert them as they had the feeling that the Amstelhotel group would run away on the journey. On their orders, the Aliens police accompanied Frau W. whilst the police arranged that the part of the train in which they were travelling would be cordoned off by the police in the Hague and in Rotterdam. They crossed the border in Rosendaal and got to Esschen in Belgium where the Aliens police left Frau W. They took a roll call of all their passengers which was correct and announced that there would be another count in Quavie , the last station before the French border. Herr Tietz asked her to keep all the passports. The whole Tietz Family did a lot to help her during the journey. Shortly after Esschen a gentleman came to Frau W. and introduced himself as the Polish Ambassador in Brussels. He requested the passports of the Polish officers of the Jewish Community as these people were to remain with him at the Embassy in Brussels. Frau W. refused this request as she had promised in Esschen to take as many people out of the country - 23 - as she had brought in. However, she was willing to call the Brussels police from Antwerp and to ask them to receive these people in Brussels. Upon this the man became furious and she never saw him again. The roll call in Quavie was again correct. Frau W. had organised the passport control in such a way that at each border every participant was to show their own passport which was carried in a special pouch. After the control, they all had to return this pouch with the passport to Frau W. The next border and control was in Fesignie. The “ Commissaire-Speciale” pointed to the director of the Warsaw Community and asked: “So who is this?” Frau W. explained. New question: “ What did you arrange for him?” “Everything. I got him his immigration visa, transit visa etc.” The only reply was “Hm”. After passport control had finished with everyone, Frau W. wanted to lock the passports again into her suitcase, when the director sneaked up to her and tried to get his passport back. The Commissaire told Frau W. that the director had come to him and had claimed that Frau W. was a dangerous woman , that she should be arrested in Paris. He asked for them all to be arrested in Paris, but Frau W. should rest assured that there was nothing against her. The Hotel Terminus in Paris which was situated directly opposite the railway station and where they were staying was difficult to reach. Police were lined up to the left and right, and they had to pass through them. At the hotel everything was surrounded by police and nobody was allowed in or out. Frau W. had the task of allocating the rooms. Again there were problems. For example, she gave a room to a married couple called Hering. They protested loudly and did not want to share a room. Frau W. did not respond to these arguments and insisted on her allocation. At 1a.m. she sat with the police to discuss the rest of the journey. The hotel was most upset about the police guard. The police in Marseilles had to be notified of their imminent arrival, also Cook’s Ltd. In addition she reserved rooms in the various hotels. For herself and the 56 children she booked into Hotel Terminus Marseilles. The next morning at 6.30 they passed through the police line-up to the railway station; from here the police accompanied them to another station. In Marseilles, the same procedure took place; where the Poles were staying, everything was closed off by police. They arrived - 24 - on a Saturday night which meant that Frau W. could not go to the travel agency before Monday where she organised all the ship’s tickets. On Monday evening the military police came to her because there was again an accusation against her; accuser: the Poles. Police:” Why are you so crazy as to help these people?” It was two days before Easter 1940 when she took the first group of this transport on board ship. (It was not a very good ship.) She allocated the cabins to the people . Then she intended to have lunch with the captain. At this moment the “Commissaire Speciale” appeared and informed her that she had travellers with false passports amongst her group. Frau W. was appalled. Three or four women (including Frau Hering) were not married and had pretended to be spouses in their passports. The men had immigration permits and were able to each take a woman with them. Hence the protests at the allocation. The Commissaire wanted to retain the people in France but with the help of some money, Frau Wijsmuller was able to sort out the matter. On the last evening, the Tietz Family handed Frau W. an envelope with 14,000 Guilders in recognition by all of them, they had made a collection and begged her to buy herself something nice. Frau W. accepted it gratefully, but not so she could buy something for herself , instead she gave it to the Jewish Committee in Amsterdam. One group of people was destined for Italy , and it was Frau W.’s task to take them to the Italian border. Hardly had the first boat left for Palestine, when the Commissaire wanted to check the Italian passports with Frau W. “Do you know that you have a Sarah with you?” “Yes, quite a few of these women are called Sarah.” “No, I am referring to a woman who has a 17 year old daughter with her, as well as a baby of 9 months. The 17 year old is never 17 years old!” The matter was examined and the following emerged: A director with a married daughter – the daughter was much older than 17 – wanted to take the grandchild with them, but had no permit for the grandchild, so pretended it was their own child. Again money had to change hands, again this was the means to solve the matter. The following day she was able to take the group to the Italian border. Before their departure for Palestine, the Poles again made difficulties for Frau W. At the Customs in Marseilles, a lot of gold was suddenly discovered with the Poles. Frau W. saved the situation by saying that she had forgotten - 25 - to declare the gold on their arrival. As they were merely passing through, she was given permission to take the gold out again. Only one of these Poles called Kruk was not amongst those who behaved badly. Later on he expressed his gratitude to Frau W. in a letter. This onerous task was now completed, and Frau W. travelled to Paris. It was Good Friday. But Frau W. did not want to return to Amsterdam until she had waited for the last children’s transport which was on its way from Riga. The children flew to Brussels and travelled on the last boat from Marseilles to Palestine. A few of the children came to England by boat, but only those who were going on to America. A scheduled boat service no longer existed since September 39. On 4th May, one single child got to Palestine via Lisbon. His parents were already in Palestine. A few children managed to get to Sao Paulo. America never took anybody without an affidavit. On 6th May 1940 Frau Wijsmuller travelled to Emmerich to collect a blind old woman , 86 years old, to take her to Holland. On her arrival something unprecedented happened: The border police asked her to come into a room. They pointed to a man outside the window. “Frau W., what is this?” “I don’t know.” “That is a tank soldier. And what is this?” “I don’t know.” “That is a tank.” They believed her that she had never seen anything like that. “If these things are standing at the border, what does that mean?” “I don’t know.” Then Frau W. and five other men were asked to sit down. “Today is Monday. We would like to ask you to come to Emmerich on Thursday on the last train . During the night, between 2 and 3 a.m. we are going to cross the border. We have always helped you to bring out the Jews. Now we need to ask for your help. We would like you to take part in the entry procession into Holland on the second car, holding flowers. You need not have any fears. Everything is well prepared. We will be driving straight through to the Hague, and at 8 p.m. we will arrest Queen Wilhelmina. The following day we will travel on to England, and for that, too, all the preparations have been made in the Dutch ports.” Frau W. laughed out loudly. “ You are joking with me. You know that I am a friend of the Jews and ,being police, you would never seriously tell me such a story. You probably agreed when you were having a jolly evening in a cafe to pull the leg of the old lady when she next comes here. But you should not play such tricks on me. Rather choose the pretty blond lady from the Hague. You know who I mean? The Blond from the fur shop who is always smuggling cocaine. “ “Did you not see our boss on the platform? He no longer wears black - 26 - but has a new green uniform. When we were invading other countries, the black uniform caused us too many problems.” Frau W. replied: “ Here comes the train. I would like to invite you for breakfast on Saturday morning at my house. I must give you my address so that you do not enter the wrong place by mistake.” The blind lady was brought to the room by a nurse. Frau W. took over from the nurse and got the papers. She jokingly said:” Hope to see you again soon.” Then she got on the train with the blind lady.Recently, whenever she returned from Germany, an official stood there in Zevenaar who asked her and other good acquaintances whether anything had happened to them or if they had seen anything noteworthy. On this occasion, Frau W. told him that in the last week German telephone wires had been extended right to the borders, that everywhere near the border haystacks (weapons) were piled up , and then she told him the story of what happened to her with the German border police and what she had replied. “You are not the first who told me this story today; we have already notified the Hague but they don’t want to believe us. Please go to the Hague tomorrow and tell them the story again.” “No, you are a paid civil servant ; they should believe you much rather than me. Go to the Foreign Office and report it. I am supposed to take Ilse Bauer to the Spanish border on 8th May and I will go to the Foreign Office to see Herr Carriere and Herr Boer and tell them that I will not go.” The train was fairly empty. At the Dutch Customs Control there were only a man and a woman apart from her with the official. The man had a German uniform in his case. He said that he had to go to Rotterdam and needed the uniform for the performance of a play within the family. In Arnheim, Herr Deutz collected her by car as the old lady was a relative of his. The next morning at 7.30 she received a phone call asking her, before going to the Foreign Office in the Hague , to come to the offices of the Dutch government in Koenigsgracht in the Hague. There she was received by Herr Quasett van Uchele. He asked her to repeat what she had told the Dutch official in Zevenaar yesterday. After her report , Herr Quasett van Uchele said: “ This is not true. Don’t you know that it is very dangerous to tell such tales?” Frau W. left and went to see Herr Carriere and Herr Boer at the Foreign Office, saying laughingly: “ At last Frau Wijsmuller is frightened. I shall not deal with Ilse Bauer.” “Don’t be so scared. We shall send a telegram to the Dutch General Consulate - 27 - in Paris to ask them, in case of emergency, to give you any necessary assistance. You can be present when we send the telegram.” She left the office and walked across the “Plein”. A short man approached her and asked: “ Are you Frau Wijsmuller?” “Yes.” “Would you please take a cup of coffee with me? I am the secretary of the French Military Attache. I was present in the room when you were having the discussion with the two gentlemen and I heard everything.” Frau W. went with him to the Hotel Central where the man showed her his ID. “Everything you said is true. The Dutch are crazy . I don’t know why they won’t believe the truth. If you travel to Paris tomorrow morning at 1.30, you will arrive at 10 p.m. Please call this number immediately; you must tell these people everything and they will help you further. On no condition should you travel to Spain. You will not be able to return.” In 1941 Frau W. met this Military Attache in Toulouse and ,in gratitude, smuggled some clothes for him from the Hague to Toulouse. She followed his advice. She arranged with the people whom she had called that the child should travel to Irum at 8 a.m. the following morning and that Frau W. would accompany her up to the first station after Paris where someone from the B.P.M. would receive the child. In the evening she returned to Paris completely exhausted. After a good meal she drank a whole bottle of Burgundy and went to bed. At 3 a.m. she was woken up by the porter of the Hotel Terminus ; she needed to go down immediately because of air raid alarm , and in any case, the Germans had invaded Holland. Because of the time difference of 40 minutes between France and Holland, he had been able to receive the news. She did not go down to the cellar. In a hotel on the Champs Elysee were acquaintances of Frau W., Herr and Frau Pollack. Frau Pollack worked on the Jewish Committee. Accompanied by two children, they all went to the Dutch consulate for advice. The Dutch consulate received Frau W. very frostily. Perhaps she was a spy. How come she knew everything in advance? And why was she able to travel back and forth between the borders, after all it was wartime. They concluded their remarks with the words: “ I always heard that the Foreign Office only sends trustworthy people abroad. You are not such a person. The Radio Station Hilversum is broadcasting such lovely music, there - 28 - simply can’t be a problem in Holland. Just listen yourself how jolly it sounds. Today is Friday. Sunday is the first day of Whitsun, Monday is the second. Are you from Northern Holland? Then you will have a third day off. Not us, though. Come back on Tuesday. Do you need money from us to survive?” “No, thanks.” “ Take care, you are now under the control of this consulate , so do not go away, but wait until you hear from us.” After this visit, Frau W. set off to Herr Troper of the Joint Distribution Committee and told him everything. She explained to him that he had to understand that she needed to go back. Afterwards she went to the Belgian consulate, showed her papers and asked for advice as to how she could return. “Do I need a Belgian visa?” “Yes, from today this is the law. But we will give you a visa.” She went back to the hotel. She had to stay in her room, and her meals were also served in her room. She gave the porter 1,000F and asked him to notify her if there was any possibility to travel to the Belgian border. The porter promised to do whatever he could. Only she should not leave the hotel. Either stay in the room or go to the restaurant. At 9.15 p.m. he called her in her room to tell her to get ready immediately as a train was leaving for the border and she should try to get on it. It was an army train , but there were also Belgian civilians who needed to get to the army. On arrival at the platform, she had to pass several high-ranking French officers. No, she could not board. When she showed them her papers, they gave their permission. She wanted to travel in First Class, but that was refused , she could not travel with the officers, only with common soldiers. She agreed to that. At 7 in the morning they arrived in Fenge. Here everything had been destroyed by bombs. Over her head it was discussed how one could get the army contingent to Antwerp. One wagon was destined for Brussels Midi. On the platform there was an argument with a pastor (the soldiers were all drunk). In Quwie they had to get out of the carriage, it was hit by bombs. The journey continued to Mons in Belgium. There, too, everything had been hit by bombs. One of the boys found a lady’s hat with a wig which had to have slid off the woman’s head. He put the wig on , everyone laughed. The tracks had also been hit by bombs, one could not continue. More discussions followed. They had to walk a certain distance. A new carriage came for them. - 29 - At 12 o’clock they arrived in Brussels Midi. Just at that moment there was a huge bombardment, and a deep crater was formed. She took a taxi to the Gare du Nord, took all the young soldiers with her , and they all travelled together to Antwerp. The train departed at 1 o’clock. In Mecheln they had to get off as the carriage was needed for the inmates of a lunatic asylum. The stream of refugees in the opposite direction was enormous. They were able to continue. Before Antwerp there was a particularly severe bombardment. The “boys” became fewer and fewer as they alighted at their destinations. On arrival in Antwerp, Frau Wijsmuller wanted to take a taxi to Puetten in Holland. The driver would only be prepared to take her if she paid him in French money so that he could flee with it. They started off. Because of air raids they had to interrupt the journey again and again. The border officials knew Frau W. well and said: “ You look as though you have not slept for days.” In a cafe she met the driver of a beer lorry who gave her a lift to Bergen of Zoom and from there to Dinteloord. It was 7 o’clock when they arrived there. She wanted to get to Nuemandsdorp which meant taking a ferry. One official did not want to let them go, it was far too dangerous, everything was full of electrically charged mines. She should go to Cochensplaat. Frau W.: “ I would not dream of it ; I can only get on from Nuemandsdorp.” 30 Dutch people joined her. They came from a circus in Belgium where they had performed. Together they took a small ferry across.On arrival in Nuemandsdorp they were immediately locked into the depot of the tram lines. The island was occupied by the Dutch military. One could see that a petrol dock in Antwerp was in flames. In Holland, the village of Zevenbergen was on fire. Sailors gave them some straw to sleep on. There were also a young man and a young girl with her, not the people from the circus. At first light they escaped to get to Nuemandsdorp. A bomb had just been dropped. “Philipspeople” – of the Philips factory – were moving in columns towards the West ; the bridge at Moerdyk was in German hands. So everybody was heading for Nuemandsdorp. The Germans dropped bombs because they thought these were army columns. The three of them hired a cart and horse which took them to the edge of the island. Only for a lot of money did a man take them across. Via another island they reached Pont op Maassluis. Every hundred metres they met Dutch soldiers who - 30 - checked them out to see if they were not men in disguise. On the first day of Whitsun they were taken to the police station. They were given a Philips car. They travelled through to the Hague. There the chaos and noise were huge. In front of the bridge towards Leiden lay many dead bodies. In Wassenaar they had to return the car to the police. They had to help them further. In another car they arrived in Leiden at 9 o’clock. Again Frau Wijsmuller was taken to be a spy. At this point she was so shattered from all the hardships that she could not even speak. She was taken to a lady who had to guard her until the morning. She slept deeply. The following morning she was picked up by soldiers . A gentleman in uniform , a Dr. Zeehandeler, had been fetched ; they might have a man in disguise who was a spy who had to be examined. By chance he was a Jew and a close acquaintance of Frau W.’s. Of course, he recognised her immediately, brought her to the General who apologised profusely and said that they would take her to Amsterdam. This is how she got to Amsterdam and her home. But – at home there was nobody. She went to the Jewish orphanage in the hope to meet her husband there. He was not there. The porter saw her driving off in an open car, accompanied by an officer and two armed soldiers and asked: “ Where have you come from?” Frau W. said jokingly: “ Can’t you see what marvellous company I have; I am under close guard.” Of course this was the escort that the general in Leiden had given her. Frau W. also could not find her housekeeper, Frau Hackmann. She went to her husband’s office, he was not there either. In the meantime she had phoned her father who was terribly worried about her and whom she had to go and see first of all. Then she went to the Jewish Committee. There she was received with the message that the police were looking for her. She immediately went to the Police Headquarters. There she was arrested as a spy. She was placed in front of a large committee who interrogated her with severity and in a most unpleasant manner. Almost all the members of the committee were known to her. Except one man, who distinguished himself through particular rudeness. Frau W. told them: “ Gentlemen, if everyone is like you, then the war will be over tomorrow , and the Germans will be here in Amsterdam. Then I would welcome being in prison , I would not have to explain why I was in Paris ; I can simply say that I was here the whole time.” She turned to the particularly unfriendly gentleman with the words: “ My mother always said I should not talk to people who have not introduced themselves. You have no manners, and I shall not answer you anymore. I hope you will lock me up quickly.” Now she was told that they - 31 - would telephone the Hague and find out more about her. Then she was taken across the street to the police station. They still claimed that she must have had German help to get through the mines. At the police station, the officers knew her well and tried to calm her. They knew perfectly that she had been working in Paris. Everything would come out alright, but she should not respond to those people in such a provocative manner. An hour and a half later she was recalled to the Police Headquarters. They said: “ You are free to go. We have spoken to the Hague and to Puetten, and your report is correct.”As she was still searching for her husband, she went back to the Jewish orphanage. The porter who had taken her joke seriously called the police station to inform them of Frau W.’s presence. At the police station they did not know that the headquarters had released her and came to pick her up again. Frau W. asked what was to be done with her. They used a terrible insult and added that women like her should be taken to Calverstraat on the second day of Whitsun so that people could through dirt at her. Frau W. asked the policemen to phone headquarters, the situation was explained, and she was allowed to go home amidst many apologies. Now she went straight to her apartment where the neighbours told her that the police had been looking for her to pick her up by car. The next morning she was asked by the army to come to the garrison and help them with one of their cases. Her reply was: “ No, yesterday at the interrogation you did not know me , so you can do your own thing now.” Later that day she received a call from England if she still wanted to send orphans to England. That very day she brought 150 people in 5 large coaches to the ship. This was the last ship to leave Holland. It departed at 7.50. At 8 o’clock, Holland capitulated. Later on ," English radio reported that Frau Wijsmuller’s ship had arrived safely. Any boat that tried to sail after that was sunk by the Germans.

78,"['Since the beginning of the year 1933, the activity of Julius Streicher made it impossible for the Jews in Nuernberg-Füerth to earn the Jews in Nuernberg-Füerth's living. After having been arrested, released, beaten-up, Julius Streicher tried to get a passport for a ‘visit’ to Holland, but seeing once hundreds of Jews arrested at Nuernberg-Füerth (26 July 1933), Julius Streicher preferred to immediately go to Emden, where Julius Streicher waited for the arrival of Julius Streicher's passport and left the country on a Dutch boat. The Events That Preceded My Leaving of Fuerth I am thirty-two years old, born in Fürth, Bavaria, son of Max Cohen, a master bookbinder. I attended the Realschule and afterwards was an apprentice in the export branch of the firm of M Zimmer, Fürth, Bavaria. During the war, in that time, my father was active in the emergency service, whilst I being my father's only son carried on my father's business at home during that time, and a year later even received a diploma from the Fürth, Bavaria trade association. I wish to emphasise in particular that I have never in my life been politically active or organised in any way. I have always earned my own living and never yet been unemployed. In 1932 I earned between 150 and 180 RM a month, but unfortunately could not save anything because I had to support my parents all the time. In the year 1933, at the end of February, I no longer had the opportunity to stand in for other people and even my father’s business, where I had worked on the side every now and then, no longer paid, for in Bavaria Julius Streicher had since January 1933 stirred up so much hatred against the Jews that it was impossible for us in Nürnberg-Fürth to earn enough money to live on. For no reason my elderly father and I were put into protective custody at 6.30 am on 10 March and – again for no reason – my elderly father and I were released the next day. My father was immediately left alone, whereas four weeks later I myself was dragged by four SS men at 9 pm into the SS meeting-place in Fürth, Turmstrasse, and again with no reason I was beaten up so hard that my nose and mouth were bleeding and my head was swollen for three days. There was nowhere you could go to complain and I went to stay for some time with my sister who lives in Rückersdorf, a little village near Nürnberg-Fürth. Despite all the torture I suffered I still could not believe that this situation in the country would last. My parents and my sisters were so worried about me that eventually I had to realise that it would be better for me to leave the country. I went to the police headquarters in Fürth, Bavaria to get a passport, saying I wanted - 2 - to visit some relatives in Holland. There I was told that I would have to go to the chamber of commerce in Nürnberg-Fürth; from there, however, I was sent back to my home town. The official, Herr Neusinger, who is an SA leader The official, Herr Neusinger, who is an SA leader himself,, demanded two photos for a passport and 3 RM. I delivered two photos for the passport and 3 RM straight away and was informed that I could collect my passport in eight days’ time. On the very day when I was to fetch my passport one of my sisters, who has been the secretary of the [Jewish] religious community in Fürth, Bavaria for about ten years, was fetched by two plain clothes policemen at about 7.30 am to unlock the community office. My parents, who were very upset, asked me to find out what was happening to my sister. When I arrived at the synagogue courtyard the synagogue courtyard was completely surrounded by SA men and one of my fellow Jews, called Mandel, was being this incident for trying to cross the synagogue courtyard. Because of this incident I ran straightaway to the police station to fetch my passport. On my way there I met four or five other Jews being escorted by SA men. Nevertheless, I dared enter the office where The official, Herr Neusinger, who is an SA leader himself, said to me very sharply, ‘You won’t get a passport to go abroad; stay here now.’ The official, Herr Neusinger, who is an SA leader himself, left the room, I dashed to the door and ran away. I went by train to Nürnberg where on 26 July I saw hundreds of fellow Jews being escorted by SA men across the market place. I went to my sister in Rückersdorf and told my brother-in-law about the events and my brother-in-law immediately advised me to leave. my brother-in-law went to Fürth, Bavaria and fetched my suitcase and money for the fare and two days later I travelled to Emden where I stayed with my aunt for five days. In the meantime, my sister had fetched my current passport and had sent my current passport to me in Emden where I stayed with my aunt for five days. First of all, I went to Fürth, Bavaria on a Dutch ship and now I was on Dutch soil!

79,"['After the Nazis came to power, Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, lost Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s job in 1933. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, accepted work with Leo Blum, a non-Jew, a salesman at country fairs and open markets. Leo Blum, a non-Jew, a salesman at country fairs and open markets was a member of the Motorsturm 22/7 of the S.A. (p.1). In 1934 Leo Blum, a non-Jew, a salesman at country fairs and open markets took Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, with Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, to Harzburg to sell their goods at a meeting of the merging of the Deutschnationale Volkspartei Hugenberg with the N.S.D.A.P. (p.1). In 1936, when it proved impossible for Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, to stay on with Leo Blum, a non-Jew, a salesman at country fairs and open markets, Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, went first to Italy and Abbyssinia in search of work, but having no permission to work Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, had to return to Germany. While crossing the border into Vienna illegally Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, was arrested as a Nazi spy. After Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s eventual release Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, was turned over to the German authorities. Tortured by the Gestapo in Munich and sent to Buchenwald Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, was released in 1938. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, went illegally into Tschbchoslovakia in 1939 and tried to escape when the Germans marched in. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, and some fellow refugees were helped by a man named Hoffmann who promised to lead He and some fellow refugees to freedom. Instead, Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, turned out to be a Nazi spy who turned the whole group over to the SS Border Police. the SS Border Police let the whole group go into Poland after robbing the whole group of the whole group's possessions. In Warsaw Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, approached the British Consul and was sent to England where Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, changed Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s name into Henry Lee. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, joined the army and entered Berlin in 1945 with the liberation army. Here Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, was united with Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s father. 4. Date : 1933 - 1945. 5. Number of pages : 6. 6. Author or Source : Henry Lee, formerly Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,. 7. Recorded by : Kurt Lewin, 1955. P.III.d No. 388 Correction - Report of Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s experiences Correction - Report of Henry Lee’s experiences was not, as erroneously stated, the 1931 Harzburg meeting but the dissolution of the Deutschnationale Volkspartei Hugenberg's German National People’s Party and Hugenberg’s German National People’s Party's fusion with the N.S.D.A.P, which took place in Harzburg in 1934. Seite 1 Abs. 2: The car was requested for 24 hours without disclosing the true reason but stayed out for more than 2 days. The S.A. Motorsturm searched for The car and found The car on the trunk road leading to Berlin. The maltreatment was a punishment for the lack of discipline of a member of The S.A. Motorsturm. - 2 - The invasion of France began in 1944 and ended with the complete occupation of Germany. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, took part in the entire campaign as soldier of the British army and entered Berlin in 1945. Naturally it is only the last part of the entire campaign as soldier of the British army that is referred to here. - 3 - Report of the experiences of Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,, formerly Heinz Lewin Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, was born in Stettin and, amongst other things because of the negative state of affairs between Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s parents, was brought up there by Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s grandfather. After completing Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s apprenticeship Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, went to Berlin where Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, joined a large hat wholesalers firm. Up to the year 1933 Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, worked like any other normal citizen and Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s life proceeded uneventfully. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, was never conscious of being Jewish and only marginally interested in politics. In the year 1933 Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s employer dismissed Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, because Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, was afraid of complications. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, was out of work for the first time. In view of the circumstances at the time it seemed unlikely that Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, would find a new job. So Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, did the only sensible thing in Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s position and took on any work that Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, was offered. A market trader, Leo Blum, offered to take Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, to markets and trade fairs to sell hosiery. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, did not hesitate for a moment and was so able to earn a living. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s friend Leo Blum gave in to the pressure put on Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, by the Association of Itinerant Traders in Germany and joined the motorized company of the S.A., Motorsturm 22/7. However, this did not tarnish Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s friendship with the Jew L. On the contrary, A market trader, Leo Blum looked after Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, in a most comradely manner. Let me mention a typical incident. In the year 1933 the meeting of the National Front, at which Hugenberg declared Hugenberg's loyalty to the Hitler regime, took place in Harzburg. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, had the idea of selling little edelweiss charms on silver-plated chains. A Jewish firm at the Börse train station supplied little edelweiss charms, the car was borrowed from The S.A. Motorsturm on a pretext, and Blum, accompanied by Kurt Lewin, set out on the journey to Harzburg. In front of the Burgberg hill on which the rally was to take place, The S.A. Motorsturm were massed. The cars were diverted and only the rally participants were allowed to drive up to the Burgberg hill on which the rally was to take place. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,, in Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s new S.A. uniform was taken for a rally participant and with a snappy “German salute” the car carrying Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, and the blond Jew rolled up the Burgberg hill on which the rally was to take place. But quickly down again on the other side. - 4 - The trading was to begin. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, and Kurt Lewin hung silver-plated chains over Blum and the blond Jew's left arms and positioned Blum and the blond Jew on the busy paths. Blum and the blond Jew called out loudly “the Führer’s favourite flower” and couldn’t serve as quickly as the women wanted to buy silver-plated chains. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, had to order another consignment from Diamant as Blum and the blond Jew had sold out Blum and the blond Jew's entire stock within a few hours. Several hundred marks earnings were the reward for this practical joke. A nasty sequel awaited Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, in Berlin. The S.A. Motorsturm was waiting for the overdue car in Weissensee and the two passengers were dragged to the party’s regular tavern. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, was badly maltreated while Kurt Lewin got away with only a few slaps in the face. It didn’t occur to any of Blum and the blond Jew that Blum and the blond Jew had a Jew standing in front of Blum and the blond Jew, particularly as a Jew's appearance did not reveal a Jew's racial affiliation. The living conditions for Jews were becoming increasingly harsh and difficult. Kurt Lewin could no longer work at public markets as Kurt Lewin always had to be prepared to have Kurt Lewin's papers checked by the gendarmerie and police. In the year 1933 Kurt Lewin decided to travel to Italy. Kurt Lewin's plan was to find refuge somewhere in the world where Kurt Lewin could live a quiet and modest life. From Italy this was impossible. Kurt Lewin spent a year there and made one attempt after another. Kurt Lewin's travels took Kurt Lewin as far as Abyssinia. At that time Eritrea had already been annexed by Mussolini as an Italian colony. A uniform tailor’s shop sent Kurt Lewin to Addis Ababa as A uniform tailor’s shop's travelling salesman with the job of taking orders for extra uniforms for the newly arrived Italian officers. But soon the police found out that Kurt Lewin didn’t have a work permit and a speedy return to Germany saved Kurt Lewin from being arrested. In Vienna, which Kurt Lewin passed through on Kurt Lewin's return journey, Kurt Lewin was his arrest. Kurt Lewin had crossed the border illegally. A raid in a small coffee house led to Kurt Lewin's arrest. This episode is not without a certain irony as they were determined to cast Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, as a Nazi spy. All Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s appeals that Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, was Jewish were cast aside by the examining magistrate with the words “Yes, yes, - 5 - that’s nothing new to us, for Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,'s dirty tricks even the Jews are good enough for Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew,!”. Kurt Lewin had to spend four weeks in remand before Kurt Lewin could convince the authorities of Kurt Lewin's innocence. Kurt Lewin had thus served Kurt Lewin's sentence for illegal border crossing. At the border Kurt Lewin was handed over to the German authorities. In Berlin Kurt Lewin was taken to the Gestapo. “Have Kurt Lewin already been brought in line?” Kurt Lewin was asked by the officer questioning Kurt Lewin. Kurt Lewin did not know what Kurt Lewin meant and said had hadn’t. “Well, then get Kurt Lewin's shoes and socks off, let’s see if Kurt Lewin have flat feet”. Kurt Lewin obeyed. Two carpet tacks, which had been specially filed to make Two carpet tacks, which had been specially filed to make them sharper sharper, were placed under Kurt Lewin's heels and then Kurt Lewin was ordered to this position. Kurt Lewin had to stay in this position for four hours holding a swastika flag in each hand. Woe betide Kurt Lewin if Kurt Lewin lowered Kurt Lewin's heels, then Two carpet tacks, which had been specially filed to make them sharper drove into Kurt Lewin's feet. “even the Jews are all antisocial elements who are sucking the blood out the body of the German people. That’s why we’re going to treat Kurt Lewin as Kurt Lewin deserve.” These words and many more were the prelude to Kurt Lewin. In the camp, where Kurt Lewin was greeted by being beaten with clubs, many ordeals and cruelties awaited Kurt Lewin. Kurt Lewin belonged to the “yard cleaning squad”. The S.S. man Berger was in charge of the “yard cleaning squad. A pile of sand which was in one of the yards had to be moved from one place to another at least five times for absolutely no reason. Two prisoners had to carry away A pile of sand which was in one of the yards on stretchers, running. Woe betide Two prisoners if Two prisoners did not run fast enough, then Two prisoners were certain to be reported which cost Two prisoners 25 cane strokes in front of the “yard cleaning squad. Kurt Lewin tried not to attract attention and thus managed to obtain Kurt Lewin's conditional release in the year 1933. That meant that if Kurt Lewin did not leave Germany within four weeks Kurt Lewin would be sent back to the camp. Immediately after Kurt Lewin's release Kurt Lewin did everything Kurt Lewin could to avoid this. But without connections, with little money, how could Kurt Lewin hope to succeed? All organisations failed as there was just too much misery and suffering. So the only option Kurt Lewin had was to take things into Kurt Lewin's own hands. Once again Kurt Lewin decided to risk leaving German territory clandestinely. - 6 - In the guise of a harmless summer visitor Kurt Lewin went to Bad Kudowa. There was an inn there whose outbuildings and toilets were already on Czech territory. The political situation was already tense to breaking point. Czechoslovakia feared invasion by Hitler and was strengthening Czechoslovakia's border police with military units. Kurt Lewin spent a few days in Bad Kudowa to sound out the lay of the land. Many routes which had been recommended to Kurt Lewin by word of mouth, as they had already provided a gateway to freedom for many hard-pressed Jews, were now closed. Twice as much caution was called for. There were camouflaged machine gun nests concealed in the bushes. The border patrols had been fortified and equipped with automatic weapons. L. observed at exactly what intervals the patrols went on the patrols's rounds. One evening, the visibility obscured by fog, Kurt Lewin decided to take the decisive step. For days before, Kurt Lewin had watched a lonely dirt track which did not differ from other dirt tracks except for having some border markings. Here the opportunity seemed favourable. a lonely dirt track which did not differ from other dirt tracks except for having some border markings ended in a small birch wood so that with the help of the increasingly dense fog there was a good chance of Kurt Lewin's flight succeeding. Kurt Lewin walked along a lonely dirt track which did not differ from other dirt tracks except for having some border markings like a solitary walker. Kurt Lewin reached a small birch wood and was thus on Czech soil. Soon Kurt Lewin was in Berlin. Kurt Lewin's flight had succeeded. There were many, many emigrants seeking refuge from the Nazis in Berlin. many, many emigrants seeking refuge from the Nazis in Prague came together there from all circles and camps. Committees and organisations of a political and social nature were formed there, at the centre of European emigration. Newspapers and pamphlets propagated the fight against Hitler-Germany, but the economic situation of many, many emigrants seeking refuge from the Nazis in Prague was wretched and miserable. Kurt Lewin shared a room with several fellow-Jews. In spite of the cramped space another victim of persecution joined many, many emigrants seeking refuge from the Nazis in Prague so that there were now 6 people living in the small room. The clouds on the political horizon were becoming darker and darker. In the year 1933 Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia. Any day - 7 - Hitler troops could arrive. The small community of fate which had come together in the small room decided to risk fleeing from Berlin. The initiator was the man who had moved into the small room last. the man who had moved into the small room last carefully sounded out all the man who had moved into the small room last's roommates for what cash and valuables all his roommates had with all his roommates because, as the man who had moved into the small room last said, the man who had moved into the small room last needed to get an idea of what bribes all his roommates might need to pay. The day of all his roommates's departure was agreed upon. An escape route was already arranged. Everything seemed to be going fine when all his roommates were roused from all his roommates's preparations by march music. The Germans were marching into Berlin. In frantic haste the six comrades set off. The organiser of his flight, who went by the name of Hoffmann, led the six comrades out of Berlin. the six comrades had to tramp endlessly through marsh and sand. Almost exhausted, the six comrades finally reached the border. the six comrades heard someone shout “Stop!”. Three S.S. men stepped out of the darkness. Hoffmann greeted Three S.S. men with “Heil Hitler” and handed over the transport. Hoffmann also handed over a precise list of all the valuables Three S.S. men had so that the S.S. had an easy job of robbing all his roommates of all all his roommates's possessions. Kicking and beating all his roommates with rifle butts, the S.S. then chased the S.S.'s victims away to their victims's uncertain fate. Kurt Lewin had some teeth knocked out, in addition Kurt Lewin was bleeding from a severe cut on Kurt Lewin's head. Kurt Lewin's clothing was torn and dusty and dirty from the long trek. Kurt Lewin and the others now stepped onto Polish soil. L. and the others managed to get as far as Warsaw. While the others reported to the various aid committees, Kurt Lewin followed the advice of an emigrant and reported to the English consulate. Kurt Lewin was given a new set of clothes, nursed back to health and then taken to Gdingen. A Swedish ship took Kurt Lewin on board and took Kurt Lewin to Berlin. Meanwhile war had broken out. Heinz Lewin a, Berlin Jew, volunteered for the British Army. Kurt Lewin's military pass was made out in the self-chosen name of Henry Lee, the name which Kurt Lewin still uses today. Kurt Lewin took part in the invasion in the year 1933 and was able to greet Kurt Lewin's father in Berlin as member of the occupying forces. today Kurt Lewin lives in London - 8 - with Kurt Lewin's family, and all the horrors of the past years were made up for by all the help Kurt Lewin received from England, the country which is now Kurt Lewin's homeland.

Erlebnisse in Belgium und Auschwitz Chaja, who spent Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's youth at home with Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's parents in Lodz, relocated to Brussels in 1930 to live with Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky, where Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz learned French and worked in her uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky's fur business. After the Nazi invasion in 1940, her uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky dissolved her uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky's fur business in 1941: her uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky managed to successfully go into hiding with her uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky's daughter Zara (15) and her uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky's two younger sons (10 and 8), while her uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky's wife and her uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky's oldest son Ary (17) were taken by surprise by Gestapo, arrested, and deported to Auschwitz in 1941, where his wife and his oldest son Ary (17) died. Chaja, who owned an apartment of Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's own, rented an apartment of her own to a Belgian family on the condition that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz could revoke this agreement. They paid the rent not in money, but in the form of food. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was taken in by an elderly, childless Italian couple whom Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had already known for an extended period of time, because an elderly, childless Italian couple whom she had already known for an extended period of time rented a house that belonged to her uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky. an elderly, childless Italian couple whom she had already known for an extended period of time, because they rented a house that belonged to Herr Ponansky had already been in Brussels for a long time, therefore Chaja, who was friends with an elderly, childless Italian couple whom she had already known for an extended period of time, because they rented a house that belonged to Herr Ponansky, could converse with an elderly, childless Italian couple whom she had already known for an extended period of time, because they rented a house that belonged to Herr Ponansky in French. The Italian worked as a trader. Staying with an elderly, childless Italian couple whom she had already known for an extended period of time, because they rented a house that belonged to Herr Ponansky offered Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz a certain security since Belgium was at that time an official ally of Nazi Germany. The Belgian family who had moved into Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's apartment did not know where Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was: at midnight, as per the agreement, The Belgian family who had moved into Chaja’s apartment delivered the rent to the Italian couple, who passed the rent on to Chaja, who was hiding in a shed normally used to store bottles. The Italians were considerably frightened and anxious as The Italians did not fully trust a Belgian family. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz always warned Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz in time for Gestapo's regular nighttime and daytime raids to arrest Jews in hiding. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was therefore likewise very frightened and anxious, daring to leave the shed, where Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had developed rheumatism, only in urgent cases. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz learned that according to the Nazis’ official notice, apparently only migrant Jews were to be arrested, while the Belgian Jews would be This assurance legal certainty. This assurance was not - 2 - upheld: from 1940 to 1944, not only migrant, but also Belgian Jews were deported after search operations that saw the streets closed off at two o’clock at night. As long as Belgian Jews were not yet being persecuted, they hid children of migrant Jews with them; Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz is also aware that Belgian Jews who could save Belgian Jews who could save themselves were also able to save many children of migrant Jews as well. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz observed that only a small number of Belgians were part of Degrelle’s fascist informer group that behaved vilely towards Jews; the overwhelming majority of Belgians were decent. For example, already in 1934, Belgians very actively supported an operation led excellently by Frau Blum to bring 1200 Jewish children out of Belgium. Furthermore, during the war, Belgians passed on, for instance, identification documents of deceased Belgian “Aryans” without a “J” stamped on deceased Belgian “Aryans” to Jews who were in danger, free of charge. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz clearly perceived the very decent attitude of the Belgian civilian population when Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz left the Italian couple in October 1943, which Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz did voluntarily as the Italian couple were resorting to the extremely risky black market for food items to earn money. Because of this, all sorts of people were coming into all sorts of people's apartment, with the result that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz could no longer enjoy the relative safety of the shed. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz therefore returned to Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's own apartment, which Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had rented out on condition Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz could reclaim her own apartment, which she had rented out at any time, in a district that was considered “judenrein” (“untainted by Jews”), i.e. that Gestapo had determined to be no longer inhabited by Jews. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's Belgian neighbours, whom Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had told, for safety reasons, that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had had an “Aryan” father, proved Chaja’s Belgian neighbours, whom she had told, for safety reasons, that she had had an “Aryan” father, to be thoroughly decent; Chaja’s Belgian neighbours, whom she had told, for safety reasons, that she had had an “Aryan” father, helped where Chaja’s Belgian neighbours, whom she had told, for safety reasons, that she had had an “Aryan” father, could, for instance, going shopping for Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz noticed that the Belgian civilians also treated one another in a comradely manner. For example, the Belgian civilians helped one another out with food. To obtain the indispensable “bread cards” (“Brotkarten”, ration cards for bread), Chaja – who of course did not officially exist – secretly gave a Frau Rauser, a Jewish woman who had migrated there from Belgium, the authorisation to collect Chaja – who of course did not officially exist –'s bread cards from the responsible Belgian officials in the town hall at midnight, using Chaja – who of course did not officially exist –'s real passport and Chaja – who of course did not officially exist –'s real address. This did not pose any risk as long as the responsible Belgian officials did not turn in anyone to Gestapo as a rule. Frau Rauser, who carried out such tasks for a fee, also delivered her bread cards, but amid the hurry and anxiety, she forgot to give Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz passport back to her, and when she was arrested in the street by Gestapo shortly after, her real passport was found in her handbag, whereupon two uniformed Gestapo officials, accompanied by a chauffeur, - 3 - arrested Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz in Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's apartment on a Monday morning – it was the New Year’s morning of 1944 – as Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was about to prepare tea for Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz, as the gas was being rationed. Although Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz explained that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz spoke French, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was interrogated in French. Upon being asked by two uniformed Gestapo officials, accompanied by a chauffeur, - 3 - if Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was Jewish, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz immediately said yes as Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz knew that a denial would lead to an immediate death penalty. On being further asked by the Gestapo officials about Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's family, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz explained that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had no relatives and was alone. However, when Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz truthfully answered the further question whether there were other Jews in hiding there in the negative, two uniformed Gestapo officials, accompanied by a chauffeur, - 3 - did not seem to believe Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz. two uniformed Gestapo officials, accompanied by a chauffeur, - 3 - dragged Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz into the stairwell and abused Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz appallingly with kicks and punches, with one of two uniformed Gestapo officials, accompanied by a chauffeur, - 3 - crudely roaring, “What are Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz yelling about, you old witch!” in response to Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's shrill cries, which were heard by the Belgian neighbours who were unable to help Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz. two uniformed Gestapo officials, accompanied by a chauffeur, - 3 - instructed a chauffeur to check if there were any Belgians in the street at that moment anyway, as two uniformed Gestapo officials, accompanied by a chauffeur, - 3 - took away Chaja, covered in blood, in two uniformed Gestapo officials, accompanied by a chauffeur, - 3 -'s car. two uniformed Gestapo officials, accompanied by a chauffeur, - 3 - brought Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz to the Gestapo cellar at Avenue Louise (Brussels), where Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz heard one of two uniformed Gestapo officials, accompanied by a chauffeur, - 3 - say to the jailer who received Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz: “Only a few more minutes (i.e. of beating), and the bitch would have kicked the bucket!” Noting that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had not indicated any other Jews hiding in the vicinity, one of the officials further remarked: “That’s a nasty woman!” and gave the order that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was to be “kept separately” and not receive any “grub” for two days. That meant that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was alone in a dark cellar room without any care, and was not allowed to receive food from the Brussels “Jewish council”, which supplied the Gestapo prisoners with the most essential food items. the most essential food items comprised only a piece of bread and a black coffee brew in the morning and a bit of soup in the evening. On the third day, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz received the order to wash down the large staircase of the Gestapo building, which extended over six floors, before Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's removal to the transit camp Malines (Mechelen) near Brussels, which was 20 minutes away and to which the Jewish prisoners were transported on lorries. When the Gestapo man added: “Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz have to do it without grub!” and Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz refused to carry out one of the officials's order with the declaration: “You can beat one of the officials to death, it doesn’t matter!”, the Gestapo officer surprisingly let Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz off. Before Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's deportation, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz noticed that the walls of the Gestapo cellar were covered here and there with pencil inscriptions by Jewish prisoners, listing relatives who had already been taken away or who had succumbed to hunger and maltreatment, and emblazoned with the Star of David. After Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's arrival in a shed normally used to store bottles, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was - 4 - hit in the face twice and had to stand facing the walls of the Gestapo cellar for two hours, as Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had neglected to salute an SS man in accordance with the concentration camp “discipline”. At two o’clock at night, the prisoners were wrenched from the prisoners's sleep to have numbers hung around the prisoners's necks. An inspection also took place nightly, apparently to check the cleanliness of feet, though in reality, An inspection was to violently hit the bare feet of the prisoners. During the transportation to Auschwitz, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz saw how 50 people – men, women, children – were jammed into each cattle car, without being let out for six hours, which was made even more unbearable by the fact that the Brussels “Jewish council” had put in only one single bucket for everyone inside to relieve themselves. This inevitably resulted in the sandwiched prisoners, under the necessity of doing the sandwiched prisoners's business, involuntarily soiling the sandwiched prisoners in a disgusting manner. Imploring pleas like: “her uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky, have mercy, open the door, the sandwiched prisoners cannot endure their business any longer!” fell on deaf ears. This resulted in the outbreak of illnesses like fever and many deaths during the five days. Upon arrival in Auschwitz, the order “Leave everything!” rang out. That meant that the prisoners had to abandon what few belongings the prisoners still possessed. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz saw how men, women and children were separated and sorted, i.e. either sent to men, women and children's deaths in the crematorium in crammed lorries or, left alive for the time being, marched into a shed normally used to store bottles. As Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's wounds had by then healed, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was spared from death. Initially, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz spent 24 hours in a shed normally used to store bottles, during which Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz received a bath and scraps of clothing, and the number 74608 was tattooed onto Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's arm. When a selection was carried out the following day, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz initially did not know what that meant: Gestapo chose 50 people, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz included, from the block Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was in, and rounded 50 people, herself included up in the Appellplatz (roll call area). Among 50 people, herself included, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz saw people who were half-starved, dying, shrivelled, standing there together, arm in arm, in groups of five. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz learned that 50 people, herself included were referred to as “Muselmänner” (Musulmans) in the slang of a shed normally used to store bottles, i.e. 50 people, herself included were condemned to death. When Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz realised what lay ahead of Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz determined that the moment 50 people, herself included were being marched off into the gas chamber, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz would quickly take one of Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's sandals in Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's hand and hit the closest-standing Gestapo guard in the face with all Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's might. Whether the closest-standing SS guard beat Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz to death or shot Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz did not care. Then, before it was Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's turn, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz thought of something else: Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz turned resolutely to the closest-standing SS guard with the explanation that she - 5 - was from Belgium, that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had been promised work here and that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz would like to work here, whereupon the closest-standing SS guard gave Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz the order “Halt!”, left Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz to stand in the icy winter frost for four hours, to then, when Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was already half-dead, dismiss Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz with the words: “March, back to a shed normally used to store bottles, old Jewish witch! The Jews wanted the war” – presumably all under the assumption that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was a Belgian Jew, i.e. that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz belonged to a category that enjoyed a certain preferential treatment, as opposed to the German and Polish Jews. When Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz returned to a shed normally used to store bottles, the 700 women who were still there could not believe the 700 women who were still there's eyes and bombarded Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz with questions about how much money or jewellery Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had secretly had with Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz to bribe the closest-standing SS guard. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's explanation that Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz owed Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's escape from certain death to Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's presence of mind and intelligence was met with disbelief. Having escaped death, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was assigned to the hard work in the Außenkommando (outside unit or external subcamp), where among other things, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had to excavate trenches and move heavy rocks. Once, when Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was unable to carry an especially heavy rock, an SS guard beat Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz with a shovel while yelling furiously: “Lazy bitch, refuses to work and wants to mess things up!”, resulting in a severe wound between Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's neck and shoulder, the trace of which is still visible today. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz collapsed, but was successfully treated by a Jewish doctor in the sick bay for 15 days although a Jewish doctor almost had no medical supplies; i.e. a Jewish doctor had only papier-mâché instead of cotton wool at hand. When Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was to spend a further 15 days in a shed normally used to store bottles, a Belgian-Jewish woman who was known in Auschwitz as “the heroic Mala of Antwerp” warned Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz of the danger of the “selection” and strongly advised Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz to return to work voluntarily to avoid extermination. Mala, who functioned as a French and German interpreter in a shed normally used to store bottles, had the task of putting together groups of prisoners to be killed, where a Belgian-Jewish woman who was known in Auschwitz as “the heroic Mala of Antwerp” succeeded in saving prisoners from death by secretly handing out numbers of prisoners who had already died to prisoners. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz died by suicide in Auschwitz. After Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was saved from death by means of Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's warning, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had to continue working in the Außenkommando until the end of the winter of 1944/45, when Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was subsequently a little safer as Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz worked in the weaving mill during the last year, 1945: but here too the armed female Gestapo supervisors sometimes violently slammed the heads of Jewish prisoners against the wall. In early 1945, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was evacuated to a shed normally used to store bottles in a prisoner transport that comprised only women. The journey was terrible as a prisoner transport that comprised only women had no tops, filled with snow, - 6 - and the bodies of women dead of cold or exhaustion piled up, and because the only food available was turnips without salt and a bit of water at night, but no bread. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz survived only through Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's strong will to live. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz had made the resolution: “Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz am ready to die; but one hour after Hitler’s death!” Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz came lastly to the Neustadt camp from Lodz, where Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz was liberated by the Russians on 3rd May 1945. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz returned to Antwerp through the Red Cross on 25th May. On Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's arrival, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz experienced, to Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's joy, how the Belgian civilian population and relatives who had survived fervently endeavoured to extend the warmest possible welcome to those who had been liberated. Good doctors took charge of Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's medical treatment. At the end of 1945, Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz returned to Brussels, where Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz married Herr Mosek Rozenszayn, who was also from Lodz, on 1st February 1950, and with whom Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz emigrated to Melbourne, Australia in 1952, where Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's husband works in a Jewish-owned textile factory. Chaja, who spent her youth at home with her parents in Lodz's uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky, mentioned at the beginning of this account, died prematurely of sorrow when Chaja’s uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky, mentioned at the beginning of this account suffered a heart attack shortly after the war; today, Chaja’s uncle Herr Nathan Posnansky, mentioned at the beginning of this account's children live in Israel.

81,"[""The author was born 1893 in Vienna and is a singer by profession. During the First World War (for 5 ½ years) The author was a Prisoner of War in Siberia. The author lived up to the beginning of 1939 almost undisturbedly in Vienna then emigrated to Shanghai in June 1939 where The author sold newspapers published by other emigrants and acted on other emigrants's stage.

Worst treatment was by Jewish guards. 10. Remarks : The Experiences of The author in Shanghai from 1939 to 1949 The author was born in Vienna in 1893. During the First World War The author spent 5½ years in Siberia as a Russian prisoner of war. In 1920 The author was sent back to Vienna as an invalid exchange. The author spent one year there and was then, without any special training, employed as an opera singer in the theatre in Bielsko-Biala. The author spent the following years, with a break of 2½ years when The author worked in an outfitters, as an opera singer and actor in several different theatres, in Berlin, Zary, Baden bei Wien, Bad Hall, Heilbronn and finally in Innsbruck. The Nazi movement had already gained a very strong foothold here in 1935. The director tried hard to keep The author on, although he The director was a supporter of The Nazi movement, but in the end The director was forced to fire The author. The author then went back to Vienna and up to 1937 The author was only able to find short-term employment there, for example as a singer in the choir when an Italian opera troupe came for a guest performance and at opera performances on the open-air stage in the Burggarten in Vienna. In the meantime and also later The author received unemployment benefit. When Vienna was occupied by the Germans, The author was not harassed. The author still managed to get free tickets for the opera every now and then, even though Jews were forbidden from going to the theatre. The author also had to have a fracture operation during this time; The author was admitted to hospital without difficulty and was well-treated there. The author was stopped on the street by an SA-man only once, on 11 November 1938, and asked if The author was a Jew. When The author confirmed that The author was and added that The author was only going to visit The author's father in the old people's home, an SA-man let The author go on The author's way. At the beginning of 1939 The author was advised by relatives to leave Austria as soon as possible. One day, as The author happened to pass by the shipping office of Lloyd Triestino, The author saw a large crowd queuing there. The author joined a large crowd queuing there without knowing at first what it was for. In the end The author discovered that the people gathered there were trying to get a passage to Shanghai. The author thought that an enquiry would not hurt, so showed my passport, which The author had with The author, when asked to do so, - 2 - and to The author's surprise The author received a ticket to Shanghai a few weeks later. The author was given the money to pay for The author's ticket in part from a cousin and in part from the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde[1]. In June 1939 The author left from Trieste bound for Shanghai. In The author's pocket The author had no more than the equivalent of the permitted ca. £4 sterling. In Shanghai, all refugees who arrived without money or other valuables were housed in Heimen[2]. all refugees who arrived without money or other valuables were, The author assume, maintained by the Joint[3] and by wealthy Jews living in Austria. The author went to the Kinchow-Heim. Like all other Europeans, The author suffered in the terrible climate from the outset. In summer we were afflicted by the humid heat of more than 90°, and in winter by the similarly damp cold. In addition, the diet, especially later on, was not only extraordinarily poor but also completely unsuitable. Our staple diet consisted of red beans called Kasha. The bread was very bad. We did not have sugar, butter, milk and meat at all for years. Only those who had a lot of money were able to afford extra food. The author started looking for a job very soon after arriving in Shanghai. Various émigré newspapers and magazines were published in the town, which were eagerly read by the approx. 20000 Jewish refugees. With others, The author took on the job of selling Various émigré newspapers and magazines on the street and so became a newspaper hawker. On some days The author sold more than 100 newspapers and therefore earned good money. Later The author also traded eggs which a wholesaler gave The author to sell. In between times, The author occasionally acted in the three émigré theatres which had been set up in Shanghai. The performances took place in the Lyceum Theatre and large cinemas. The author remember one performance which was premiered at the British Embassy. The repertoire was wide, Molnar and Schapiro for example. After spending a year in the Kinchow-Heim, The author had to move to the Alcoch-Heim. the Alcoch-Heim was a former barracks of the Belarusian Volunteer Corps, which was very dilapidated and supported on one side by beams. the Alcoch-Heim was in the Honchen district which was mainly populated by Chinese. In the first Chinese war in 1928 this part of Shanghai had been completely burned down, but was later rebuilt in an emergency. After Japan's entry into the first Chinese war in 1928, all stateless persons, most of whom - 3 - were the Jewish refugees, were forced to move into the Alcoch-Heim. Jewish shops and businesses located in other parts of Shanghai also had to move here. As a result, the Alcoch-Heim where The author lived was soon unimaginably overcrowded. There were no fewer than 130 people in The author's room. As a result of the climate and the totally inadequate and unsuitable nutrition, an extraordinary number of illnesses prevailed among the inhabitants of the Kinchow-Heim, and in general among the Jewish refugees, such as epidemic typhus, typhoid, dysentery, arthritis, pneumonia and especially leukaemia. Deaths were part of everyday life. A large number of refugees died directly of starvation. Of the 130 occupants in The author's room, no less than 30 died over the course of time. The resources available to the doctors were extremely inadequate. When the Germans occupied Shanghai in December 1941, the restrictions on the Jews were increased. the Jews were only allowed to leave the Honchen district if the Jews were issued with the Jews's own special permit. the Honchen district was not closed off from the other districts. the Honchen district's entry-points were also not particularly guarded. There were just boards everywhere notifying that stateless persons were forbidden to enter other districts of Shanghai. Anyone found outside without a permit was punished. Since many of the Jewish refugees had found jobs in Chinese shops and businesses in other parts of Shanghai, it was imperative for many of the Jewish refugees to get a permit for many of the Jewish refugees's daily travel if many of the Jewish refugees did not want to lose many of the Jewish refugees's job. These permits were issued by the Japanese commander of the Honchen district, Goja, who called the Japanese commander of the district, Goja, who called himself King of the Jews King of the Jews. the Japanese commander of the district, Goja, who called himself King of the Jews was a very remarkable man, a great music-lover and keen on Western culture, who played chamber music and often came to performances by our theatre groups with many other Japanese people. But that didn't stop the Japanese commander of the district, Goja, who called himself King of the Jews from sometimes slapping the Japanese commander of the district, Goja, who called himself King of the Jews's fellow chamber musicians at events in the face and kicking his fellow chamber musicians. Those requesting permits for other city districts often first got slapped and kicked too, but were then mostly issued with Those requesting permits for other city districts's permits, sometimes for the wrong district just for fun. All in all though the Japanese commander of the district, Goja, who called himself King of the Jews tried hard, as best as the Japanese commander of the district, Goja, who called himself King of the Jews could in the circumstances, to see to the welfare of the Jews. - 4 - In general, we could not complain about the behaviour of the Chinese and later the Japanese towards us. Certain oddities you had to get used to, like the Chinese forbidding us to show ourselves bare-chested in the street. the Germans often imposed severe penalties for offences against the existing regulations. Torture is also said to have taken place. However, the Germans successfully resisted the erection of gas chambers, which The author heard was planned by Captain Wiedemann after Captain Wiedemann's appointment as German Consul General in Shanghai. the Germans also allowed the Jewish refugees to do the Jewish refugees's jobs, often in other districts of Shanghai, without much harassment. The sums of money that the Joint regularly sent, even during the Japanese occupation, to Jewish refugees were distributed without any problems up to a period of 3-4 months, when distribution was stopped by the Germans for unknown reasons. The amount that each individual received was only very small, but The amount that each individual received was still a help. The guard command established by the Jews the Jews themselves often behaved worse than the Germans. The author know of a case where a Jew, who was said to have stolen something, was beaten to death by a guard commando. The only encounter The author had with the Germans was with a drunken man who invited The author to go with a drunken man who invited me to go with him to a bar to a bar. When The author refused, a drunken man who invited me to go with him to a bar slapped The author. the first Chinese war in 1928 then ended and the Germans left Shanghai. The author had latterly found no employment and had great trouble keeping The author from starvation. The author's body weight had dropped to less than 100 pounds. Like almost all other refugees, The author was only made of skin and bones. The author also suffered from leukaemia which slowly improved only later on. Everything changed after the arrival of the Allies. We received food from the Unrra[4], which helped us to get back on our feet to some extent. In 1947 The author was offered a private room, where The author then lived. In 1949 The author's sister who lived in England asked for The author. The author also received the English entry visa and, at the Joint's expense, left for England after a 10-year stay in Shanghai.

Death in Theresienstadt me, and several hundred others arrived at 4 o’clock in the morning. me, and several hundred others had sat in the compartment for days prior to that, since Sunday the 19th of July 1942. The journey proceeded during nights without sleep. me, and several hundred others never knew where me, and several hundred others were because me, and several hundred others circumvented all stations. Finally, the train stopped in an open field and me, and several hundred others were thrown out of the carriages, so to speak, with me, and several hundred others's luggage behind me, and several hundred others. It lay in the dirt of an open field. me, and several hundred others had to form up in rows. I got to grips with my suitcase, my food basket, my blanket and moved forwards. me, and several hundred others moved off in columns. There were 1200 people, mainly elderly who dragged 1200 people, mainly elderly who dragged themselves along behind each other for two hours on a route that normally would take 15 to 20 minutes along behind each other for two hours on a route that normally would take 15 to 20 minutes. However, me, and several hundred others were tired and I in particular was not used to carrying anything. The soldiers encouraged me, and several hundred others to hurry up. It was effort in vain. me, and several hundred others could not. In the end, I relieved myself of my basket and my blanket by throwing my basket and my blanket onto the lorries that accompanied me, and several hundred others. After me, and several hundred others's walk, òu l’on n’en pouvait plus / where me, and several hundred others couldn’t take any more of it, me, and several hundred others saw below me, and several hundred others on a plain a big yellow building. That is a big yellow building, they told me, and several hundred others and me, and several hundred others took heart at that. Finally, me, and several hundred others arrived. An open gateway greeted me, and several hundred others – there was a big courtyard in a quadrangle without a tree or a blade of grass – on each side, the architecture was the same: two stories and a roof structure. On the other side of an open field, there was the same gateway and a stairwell on the left. me, and several hundred others climbed up. That meant, me, and several hundred others climbed and then the whole crowd stood still on virtually every step. Here, my strength threatened to leave me, but me, and several hundred others were all held upright by the human wall in front and the mass behind. After another 30 minutes to two hours, me, and several hundred others were at the top and the doors were closed behind me, and several hundred others. It was all over. me, and several hundred others stood in a huge room – windows to the right and windows to the left. I would have like to have sat down, but where? In a huge room – windows to the right and windows to the left, there was a floor, a ceiling, walls and windows, and no furniture. Supposedly, chairs, tables, beds and bedsteads were to be memories from the past. I placed myself at a window and looked out. In the middle of the barracks square, because that is what it had been, there was a fountain covered by large stones. a fountain covered by large stones did not work anymore, and behind in a corner there was a small waggon with a small thin horse attached. There were rectangular boxes on a small waggon with a small thin horse attached, completely new; I counted 29. What were rectangular boxes on it for? Suddenly, it dawned on me – coffins. I left a window and sat on my suitcase. My blanket and my food basket were brought up to me during the morning. Two young Czechs with naked torsos poured coffee into our bowls which was not bad. Two young Czechs with naked torsos knew how to make very drinkable coffee from coffee substitutes. a huge room – windows to the right and windows to the left and the rooms on the floors below filled up. I stayed at a window. My place and my number were given to me. I shared the area by the window niche with another woman. There was an old man and two women opposite. This man, who was around 60, was very exhausted. the old man coughed now and again. the old man did not even have a blanket or a small trunk to sit on. the old man sat with the old man's back leaning against the wall. the old man woke me during the night. the old man never stopped coughing. I called Dr. B., who came from Hamburg, and drew Dr. B., who came from Hamburg, and drew his attention to the suspicious posture of the old man's attention to the suspicious posture of the old man: the old man pulled the old man's knees high in a type of cramp and the old man gave out a smell. Dr. B., who came from Hamburg, and drew his attention to the suspicious posture of the old man contented Dr. B., who came from Hamburg, and drew his attention to the suspicious posture of the old man with saying that the old man had been the old man's patient in Hamburg and that the old man thought it not necessary to have water from the old man's bladder released. There was the same coughing the next night. It appeared to me that I was witnessing an agony; he wheezed. I stood up and put one of my pillow cases under his head. He fell asleep and never woke again. The carried him away the following morning, dead. When on the third day, they told me, and several hundred others that me, and several hundred others would move into a house, Dr. I. from Hamburg, who was 83 years of age, gave Dr. I. from Hamburg, who was 83 years of age and injection and died. Dr. I. from Hamburg, who was 83 years of age preferred to kill Dr. I. from Hamburg, who was 83 years of age rather than live in the houses which they had shown me, and several hundred others during a walk, as me, and several hundred others were led by them in closed groups. To write a letter was punished by the death penalty. At the beginning, 16 young Czechs were hung for this misdeed. Mr. Heller and Mr. Heller's sister took veronal before the move of a part of the residents of the barracks. One Sunday, when me, and several hundred others came back from a walk, I was notified that I would move the following morning, me, and several hundred others. me, and several hundred others left the barracks and me, and several hundred others remained standing in the same street L 409. 18 of me, and several hundred others were allocated to a house. The house senior and The house senior's assistants ran me, and several hundred others around here and there and did not know how could achieve it. The house senior had not been notified and The house senior had no space. After a long debate, The house senior and his assistants succeeded in accommodating most of me, and several hundred others. The house senior opened for me a door above a badly smelling courtyard, with a flat floor projecting into this courtyard behind a door above a badly smelling courtyard, with a flat floor projecting into this courtyard behind it. The house senior indicated to me the corner as my future dwelling. I threw my blanket behind the said door (which would have been impossible for a dog) and waited till all others were accommodated. Then I went back to the entrance to a house and said that I would not accept a house. “Then you go back to the barracks.” “Ok, a house is better than here.” At this moment, the room senior from the parterre room came up to me: “there are 17 people in the room senior from the parterre room's room and the room senior from the parterre room cannot give you a place. Do you want to lie in the middle of a house?” “With pleasure!” “At least there was light and air! And I went there. a huge room – windows to the right and windows to the left had formerly been a shop with a shop window that did not open and a type of balcony door which led to the street. a huge room – windows to the right and windows to the left was about 6 to 7 metres wide and long and held 18 people with me, of whom the majority remained on mattresses day and night even when they washed themselves. A storeroom at the back of about 2.5 times 4 metres gave access to a huge room – windows to the right and windows to the left. There was no windows in A storeroom at the back of about 2.5 times 4 metres; during the day a weak light came in through the door window of the neighbouring room which led out into a badly smelling courtyard, and then through the door opening without a door that led to me, and several hundred others's room. 8 people were lodged there. To reach me, and several hundred others me, and several hundred others had to step over the legs of a tall person, who lay across the door opening. a tall person, who lay across the door opening lay there continually ill and that appeared to have been the case for weeks. If a tall person, who lay across the door opening had to go out, the room senior from the parterre room called two men, in order to take a tall person, who lay across the door opening to a badly smelling courtyard because a tall person, who lay across the door opening was heavy and could not stand up by a tall person, who lay across the door opening. Likewise, a tall person, who lay across the door opening was accompanied back and laid on the ground. If I went over a tall person, who lay across the door opening, I took care to say excuse me, until one day, the room senior from the parterre room said to me: “It’s not necessary. a tall person, who lay across the door opening doesn’t hear anymore.” “How?” “a tall person, who lay across the door opening died this morning.” “Died? And a tall person, who lay across the door opening is still there?” They did not even come until the evening to take a tall person, who lay across the door opening away. Around a tall person, who lay across the door opening, they continued to eat, chat and had a siesta, and they were supposed to spend the night beside the corpse? Not me! Despite the resistance from all sides, I dragged my bedclothes away and laid down on the tiles of the landing on the first floor. The house senior acted as if The house senior had seen nothing. I also went up the next night. Finally, on the third day Mrs. G. said to me: “You can stay here because today in the afternoon they will fetch the corpse.” I found better lodgings barely 14 days later. I was accommodated in Q 610. a house was a large house with several small balconies, large windows, a kitchen with ovens of which 3 were heated in winter, and with a garden in the rear. There was even luxurious architecture. My allocated place, again still on the ground, was at the entrance of the third room (again without a door) which adjoined a very spacious room on the parterre. a very spacious room on the parterre was occupied by 22 people or more; the one adjoining a very spacious room on the parterre by 7 to 8 people; and that beside a very spacious room on the parterre by 7 people amongst whom was one who was completely paralysed. She never left a very spacious room on the parterre and had to go to the toilet there with the help of her sister. It was neither healthy nor savoury, but me, and several hundred others had to respect 7 people amongst whom was one who was completely paralysed. I arrived there at the beginning of August and I stayed there until the 1st of April 1943. The first of my acquaintances who died was Mrs. Frank. The first of my acquaintances who died died from dysentery. me, and several hundred others had to go to The first of my acquaintances who died's burial on the Saturday afternoon and again on the Sunday morning. her burial was on the other side of the bridge behind the Jaeger Kaserne (Jaeger barracks). The bearers disappeared to fetch the coffins from what was properly a former munitions depot, which, seen from outside, appeared to fade into complete darkness. The bearers laid one down at me, and several hundred others's feet and returned again, in order to fetch another. Finally, there were 40 of The bearers lined up in front of me, and several hundred others. Mrs. Frank was not amongst 40 of them lined up in front of us. me, and several hundred others had to go back to a house. There were not enough people there to dig the graves, so of course me, and several hundred others never went there. Finally, on the Sunday morning, the coffins was placed amongst the same number of other coffins. Dysentery had begun to become an epidemic. There were up to 100 cases daily. The bearers were no longer able to make so many coffins, and towards the middle of winter, The bearers began to wrap the bodies in bed clothes or some other cover, in order to carry the bodies through the streets. It was harrowing. A doctor friend of mine said to me discretely that The bearers had built a crematorium. However, the news spread rather quickly and given the daily mortality rate, there was general agreement that a crematorium was a hygienic measure. The chapter on hygiene was bleak. With a few exceptions, there was no drainage and for months we had no water in our house. You had to fetch it from the neighbouring houses. The vermin plague increased. Lice! From our house alone, 60 to 80 people with all of 60 to 80 people with all of their things's things needed delousing in a day. Many old, sick and weak people did not survive the procedure. In many cases, Dysentery led to Typhus. Typhus raged in the city after dysentery. The doctors performed a strenuous and heroic effort under unimaginable conditions. In house Q 610, death began to appear in a steady flow. In me, and several hundred others's small room, 3 died within 3 weeks. Beside me, and several hundred others, 2 people, as well as the paralysed lady and the paralysed lady's sister. A person died very peacefully beside the glass door in our small room, so that in the morning, I recognised from the way that the women lay, who lived and who had died. Shocking scenes unfolded. I wanted to go through the glass door in the big room. However, on the ground lay one of the women, and in the middle there were the women bending over one of the women on two women bending over her on their knees's knees; one held her hand whilst the other strove to pull off a ring. the women worked with all of the women's strength, but the women did not succeed in doing it. her hand, with rigor mortis in the fingers, would not let go of a ring. I threw a cursory glance at the group. one of the women was dead whilst several hundred others continued to pull. There were no medicines there. The widow of a teacher from Hamburg in my room was weak; The widow of a teacher from Frankfurt in my room's heart. The doctor and a nursing sister looked after The widow of a teacher from Frankfurt in my room every day. I made The widow of a teacher from Frankfurt in my room's herbal tea every lunchtime. One afternoon, I found The widow of a teacher from Frankfurt in my room's fainter than ever. The widow of a teacher from Frankfurt in my room's daughter was already dead and since that moment Her daughter no longer wanted to be healthy. I met The doctor and a nursing sister as The doctor and a nursing sister were standing before Her daughter as Her daughter lay on the ground. I asked The doctor if it was possible to procure something to give Her daughter's strength. “Her daughter should pray,” The doctor sneered and a nursing sister laughed. My neighbour, whose area abutted mine, did no wake up one morning. Her daughter must have been still warm as the women tore into the women over Her daughter's suitcase, in order to ‘inherit’ her suitcase. Her daughter was taken away around midday. In the afternoon, two men from the ghetto court appeared to take away Her daughter's suitcase legally. “Is everything in there?” two men from the ghetto court asked and probably knew that everything was never in the suitcases. “Including Her daughter's eating utensils?” “Yes, here.” “Good” and two men from the ghetto court went. In a house, two men from the ghetto court placed the bodies in a shed; the so-called magazine. a shed; the so-called magazine contained old junk, mattresses, dirty bedclothes, old buckets, old wood, unidentifiable objects, and the bodies lay in the vicinity of old junk, mattresses, dirty bedclothes, old buckets, old wood, unidentifiable objects up to the moment when the bodies could be laid on a wagon in the bodies's blanket or sheet with the other dead who were fetched from other houses. If a shed; the so-called magazine was portable, then two men went through the streets with two men's load; if it was a wagon, then some men pulled from the front, whilst others pushed from behind and took the bodies behind the Jaeger barracks where together the bodies received a prayer before the bodies were burnt. They had established a cemetery for urns on one of the redoubts, and on me, and several hundred others's walks one or the other of me, and several hundred others cast a glance in greeting or in remembrance towards the cemetery for a friend or a father or a sister. It was November 1944. It was cold when I came to a house towards the evening. “Imagine this. This afternoon, the women in the next room (the Hamburg barracks where I had lived since the 1st of April 1943) were assembled for a work detail, even those who were over 80.” “What kind of work?” “I don’t know. the women in the next room (the Dresden barracks where I had lived since the 1st of April 1943) will come back to a house.” the women in the next room (the Dresden barracks where I had lived since the 1st of April 1943) were assembled at the cemetery. There, the women in the next room (the Dresden barracks where I had lived since the 1st of April 1943) had to excavate the urns, numbered boxes, and pass the urns hand to hand to a lorry which stood there. There was the same call the next day for up to 76 year olds. However, up to 76 year olds came back not dissatisfied. up to 76 year olds had received bread and a tin of liver paste for up to 76 year olds's work. That was a luxury … well paid. A clerk stood before my bed on the third day at 7 o’clock in the morning. “Report at 11 o’clock to the Magdeburg barracks for a work assignment.” I got up determined not to do Report. To disinter the ashes, the sole resting place of my poor friends. Would it not disgrace the sacred peace of the unfortunates who have died? Never, not me. I took advantage of my heart attack and the unconsciousness which would be the unfailing consequence of the strain, if I had to bend for hours at a time. Futile, but I had to try it. I went over to the Magdeburg barracks, work assignment, from office to office. “You are not going to report for work.” And for what reason. I sped over to the doctor. the doctor examined me thoroughly. “What the doctor say is true, but the doctor cannot excuse the doctor.” “Please give me a prescription for cardiazol.” the doctor did. Then I went back to the Magdeburg barracks deliberating the pros and cons. One of my room mates met me. “Whilst you were away, the women have been asked to peel potatoes, 4 hours.” “Where?” “In the Magdeburg barracks.” Despite my tiredness, I ran there. “Be here at 1 o’clock with knife and apron.” There were no potatoes; there were turnips. I was there at 1 o’clock. There were turnips from the floor to the ceiling in an unheated room. Two rows of women of various ages, including me, cut the thick skin from turnips from the floor to the ceiling in an unheated room. After two hours, I had a pain in my hand, but Two rows of women of various ages, including me gave me, and several hundred others a plate of hot soup. There was a break and then at further two hours until the finish at 5 o’clock. I stood up and asked One of my room mates to certify that I had peeled turnips for 4 hours. “Why?” “In case I am asked why I was not at the cemetery.” I got my proof plus a fat turnip. For four days, men, women and children exhumed 30,000 numbered boxes from the cemetery for urns. What men, women and children did with men, women and children, I do not know. Could 30,000 numbered boxes have been used as fertilizer? I have no expertise in the field of agriculture.

83,"['A report on the internment in Sachsenburg of 21 Protestant clergymen from Saxony. 21 Protestant clergymen from Saxony were compelled to do the same heavy work as the other prisoners, for example, to draw open vans heavily loaded while singing and running. On Easter-Monday, the trombonists of the Thomaskirche, Leipzig, assembled on a hill near the camp and blew some Easter-chorals in honour of the trombonists of the Thomaskirche, Leipzig,'s imprisoned Oberpfarrer Walter (p.2). An English Quaker the visit the camp was very much astonished to find some prisoners to be interned there already for two years; although the visit had no consequences (p.2-3). Nor were 21 Protestant clergymen from Saxony released after the inspection of the Statthalter of Saxony Mutschmann whose only question, if Jesus was a Jew, was answered unanimously in the affirmative. Later, two Catholic priests interned enjoyed a better treatment (p.3-4). 9. Further References : 10. Remarks : See related reports for further information : P.III.h. (Sachsenburg) No. 569 P.III.h. (Sachsenburg) No. 571 P.III.a. (General) No. 572 Clergymen in the KZ Holy Week 1935 must have been a difficult one for the Bekenntniskirche church in Saxony, because no fewer than 21 Lutheran ministers were interned at the Sachsenburg concentration camp between Maundy Thursday and Easter-Monday. Among no fewer than 21 Lutheran ministers were well-respected names such as the two senior ministers Meder and their imprisoned Oberpfarrer Walter from Leipzig. their imprisoned Oberpfarrer Walter was the minister at the Leipzig Thomaskirche church, where Germany’s greatest musician, Johan Sebastian Bach, hat worked in Germany’s greatest musician, Johan Sebastian Bach's time. But the new inmates were protected by neither name nor rank nor age. To not beat around the bush: The servants of God’s word, the messengers of the gospel, were not treated a jot better than the political or even criminal inmates. The servants of God’s word, the messengers of the gospel were nothing more than inmates – prisoners held in “protective custody” – a term that says it all. The servants of God’s word, the messengers of the gospel were bullied as soon as The servants of God’s word, the messengers of the gospel lined up for The servants of God’s word, the messengers of the gospel's first roll call. Untersturmfuehrer [second lieutenant] Weigel, who was in charge of the inmates and was ironically called “uncle”, took sadistic pleasure in putting the ministers down in front of all the other inmates. “You hypocrites”, Untersturmfuehrer [second lieutenant] Weigel, who was in charge of the inmates and was ironically called “uncle” bellowed, “you rubbish pastors, you black crows, you rubbish pastors, you black crows lied to the people and cheated the people! But we will get you rubbish pastors, you black crows for it!” Untersturmfuehrer [second lieutenant] Weigel, who was in charge of the inmates and was ironically called “uncle” took a particular dislike to one of the two Ackermann brothers, both of the two Ackermann brothers, both of them ministers in the Vogtland district ministers in the Vogtland district. Untersturmfuehrer [second lieutenant] Weigel, who was in charge of the inmates and was ironically called “uncle” shouted at one of the two Ackermann brothers, both of them ministers in the Vogtland district, “what sort of shit did one of the two Ackermann brothers, both of them ministers in the Vogtland district tell people from one of the two Ackermann brothers, both of them ministers in the Vogtland district's pulpit?!” and put one of the two Ackermann brothers, both of them ministers in the Vogtland district down with all sorts of other words that would be too strong to repeat even at a men’s night out. the ministers did not get any special treatment at the camp. the ministers were put to the same work as all the other inmates, both indoors and outdoors, meaning that the ministers had to work building roads and quarrying rocks; the ministers had to load gravel and rocks, pull road rollers and heavily loaded pushcarts – at a run and singing all the while! Sometimes the ministers were even tormented more and shouted at more cruelly than all the other inmates. The SS men visibly enjoyed taking The SS men's meanness out on The SS men's defenceless victims. Offensive words such as “pig”, “black Mameluk” or “parson swine” were used on a daily basis. - 2 - Because the ministers were not up to the heavy physical work, some of the ministers became totally incapacitated and broke down. Some developed painful tendinitis and needed treatment at the camp hospital. Things were easier for those working inside the camp. An older missionary with a big, flowing beard stood out in particular. The camp commanders had made An older missionary with a big, flowing beard a bath attendant, because An older missionary with a big, flowing beard was already over sixty. An older missionary with a big, flowing beard had spent An older missionary with a big, flowing beard's life in Central Africa and German East Africa, that is among non-civilised people, and now An older missionary with a big, flowing beard had an opportunity to see how civilised societies treat civilised societies's own. An older missionary with a big, flowing beard spoke Swahili and a dozen African dialects, but An older missionary with a big, flowing beard visibly struggled to get used to the brisk commands of the ministers. Yet An older missionary with a big, flowing beard never lost An older missionary with a big, flowing beard's sense of humour. An older missionary with a big, flowing beard consoled An older missionary with a big, flowing beard by quoting the Bible: “Lord, forgive them, for they know not what they do”. There was a big surprise at noon on Easter-Monday. A band of trombonists from the Leipzig Thomaskirche assembled on a hill next to the camp and played several beautiful Easter hymns in honour of and to give courage to A band of trombonists from the Leipzig Thomaskirche's imprisoned minister Walter. It was a very impressive demonstration! If I may say so: A band of trombonists from the Leipzig Thomaskirche's blare hit the camp like a bomb! At first, the ministers had no idea what was happening. Once the ministers had recovered from the ministers's bafflement, the ministers charged up a hill next to the camp upon “uncle’s” orders, took the ten men in the trombonists’ band prisoners and brought the ten men in the trombonists’ band prisoners back to the camp. the ten men in the trombonists’ band prisoners were taken to the watch chamber, where the ten men in the trombonists’ band prisoners spent quite a few hours under heavy guard until the ten men in the trombonists’ band prisoners were finally released in the evening after a lot of toing and froing. We had another surprise in late April or early May, when the camp was the visit from the English Quaker commissioner by an English Quaker commissioner, who not only attended to those ministers who were ill and had been taken to the camp hospital, but also roamed around the camp. English Quaker took it upon English Quaker to speak personally with individual inmates in protective custody, and this is how English Quaker found out to English Quaker's absolute astonishment that some had been held in the camp for over two years already. While the SS Sturmbannführer [major] who accompanied English Quaker objected, saying that these were isolated cases, English Quaker was immediately corrected by that particular inmate, who mentioned the names of seven or eight others who had all suffered more than two years imprisonment in the camp already. English Quaker's face turned bright red, but English Quaker did not have anything to say in response. - 3 - However, the visit from English Quaker did not have any effect at all on the situation of the ministers. the ministers continued to be mistreated all the same. Once Mutschmann, the governor of Saxony, came for a visit Mutschmann, the governor of Saxony to see whether the ministers had already been worn down and were therefore ready for release. Mutschmann, the governor of Saxony wanted only one question to be answered by the clerics: “Was Jesus a Jew?” One after the other, the ministers this answer, “Yes, Jesus was a Jew”. Since this answer was not what Mutschmann, the governor of Saxony had hoped for, this answer is a response in line with the race theory of the Third Reich, Mutschmann, the governor of Saxony realised that Mutschmann, the governor of Saxony had come too soon, and Mutschmann, the governor of Saxony left again. None of the clerics was released at the time. The case of a minister from Falkenstein, who was interned at the camp at the time, illustrates how fundamentally futile the National Socialists’ fight against the word of the Evangelists was. a minister from Falkenstein, who was interned at the camp at the time's church had once been almost empty, but when a minister from Falkenstein, who was interned at the camp at the time came to be attacked by the National Socialists’, the Falkenstein church could hardly hold the people flocking to a minister from Falkenstein, who was interned at the camp at the time's Sunday services any more. Sometimes over 2500 people would attend a minister from Falkenstein, who was interned at the camp at the time's service. the ministers were not released until Tuesday before Whitsunday. (One of the ministers, minister Ackermann, whom I have already mentioned, was imprisoned a second time between August and September 1935. One of them, minister Ackermann, whom I have already mentioned had been removed from One of them, minister Ackermann, whom I have already mentioned's church and had committed the crime of preaching in a barn.) It should be noted that the ministers showed a comradely spirit towards the ministers's fellow inmates. the ministers were always helpful. On the very day of the ministers's release, the ministers donated all of the ministers's money for the benefit of the other inmates who had to remain inside the camp. Later, two Catholic priests were also imprisoned at the Sachsenburg concentration camp between Maundy Thursday and Easter Monday. two Catholic priests stood out in that two Catholic priests did not wear prisoners’ clothes, but rather two Catholic priests's black cassocks. two Catholic priests also did not have two Catholic priests's hair cut short but kept two Catholic priests's tonsures. two Catholic priests received preferential treatment compared to two Catholic priests's Lutheran colleagues. two Catholic priests were not put to work, except that one of two Catholic priests wrote down the music for the SS songs. two Catholic priests spent most of two Catholic priests's time reading two Catholic priests's breviaries. It was said that the concordat protected two Catholic priests from having to perform physical work, but the concordat did not protect two Catholic priests against the guards’ insults. - 4 - It happened that an SS guard used an SS guard's rifle to knock the breviary out of one of two Catholic priests's hands, mocking an SS guard with the words, “pick up an SS guard's rubbish from the dirt!” ']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In December 1938 Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, even went to see Eichmann in Vienna and got Eichmann's permission for the emigration of 10,000 Jewish children to England. As a first instalment Eichmann ordered a transport of 600 children to be sent across the Dutch frontier within a few days to see if Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, would really get 600 children into England. After Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, had succeeded - 100 children were accepted by England - Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, organised transports of 150 children twice a week from various parts of Germany to Britain as well as the emigration of Youth Aliyah and other groups from Germany, England, Denmark and Riga. Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, accompanied 150 children up to Marseille on 150 children's way to Palestine. Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, also tried to find asylum for grown-up Jewish refugees. In 1939 Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, arranged for the acceptance by England of 200 refugees from the 1200 passengers of the ship St. Louis, who had not been allowed to land in Cuba because the 1200 passengers of the ship St. Louis, who had not been allowed to land in Cuba because their visas had been forged's visas had been forged. Also in 1939 Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, helped with the departure of the Greek ship Dora, which sailed from England with illegal immigrants for Palestine. As late as 15 May 1940 Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, tried to get 80 refugees released who were kept in bad conditions in a disused market hall in Gravenzond. But the Dutch Aliens' Police refused Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman,'s request and send the refugees back to Germany. Only one survived. During Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman,'s journeys Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, was repeatedly taken as a spy and arrested. Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, was asked by the Germans to work as the Germans's agent and refused. Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, had Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman,'s passport stolen (which was later found on a German spy in a French camp). Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, was told by German frontier police about the impending invasion of England, but neither Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman,, nor the Dutch Foreign Ministry believed the impending invasion of Holland. 9.

Saving of Jewish Children Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer is Dutch and a Christian. In that time Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was asked by Jewish acquaintances if Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer would help if necessary. Quite soon Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer had the opportunity to put Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's acceptance into action. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer performed the task which, at that time, could not be rendered officially by the committees, of helping people to cross the border illegally. This Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer did from that time – 1938. On 11th October that time , Frau Asscher and Frau Andriesen (wife of the director of the Pierson Bank) opened an office in Ostend to help the children, and Frau Asscher and Frau Andriesen (wife of the director of the Pierson Bank) asked Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer to assist the children. Later this turned into a Children’s Committee which was founded exclusively by non-Jews. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's work began immediately. In Frau Kramarsky’s car Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer travelled to the South of England to Limburg. The Dutch police was sending children back who came across the border at that point. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer induced the border police office to call the Aliens’ Police in the Hague first before rejecting the children, and in this way Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer obtained permission to keep the children in Germany. This also led to the reformation of the Children’s Committee as the Children’s Committee's work had to allow for new demands. On 17th November the Children’s Committee received a letter from Hamburg informing the Children’s Committee that the children were being terribly maltreated by the Gestapo. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was asked to travel to Hamburg to put things right. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer took the night train in order to get there at 6 a.m. When Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer reached the family, it turned out that a letter from Hamburg informing them that 2 children aged three months were being terribly maltreated by the Gestapo was based on a lie. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer remonstrated with the woman who had written a letter from Hamburg informing them that 2 children aged three months were being terribly maltreated by the Gestapo about the woman who had written the letter about her duplicity's duplicity but nevertheless Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer helped to send the children to Switzerland. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer telephoned the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer to come to the consulate in order to see with Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's own eyes how many women and children were sitting at the consulate with their children in the hope of being allowed to go to England, but the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate was unable to help their children officially. This was the help the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate expected from Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer. the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate asked Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer to travel back to England on the same day, accompanied by 5 girls and a boy. When Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer objected that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was not able to do this, the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate replied: “ If it were easy, the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate would not need Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's help.” the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate notified the parents that the parents's children would be departing at 3 p.m.; at 1 p.m. the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate had 6 passports ready and had made reservations for the train to Osnabrueck as well as from there -after changing trains- to England. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer departed with Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's 6 proteges , changed trains in Osnabrueck and arrived at the border at Bentheim. Each child was permitted to have 10 DM. In Bentheim Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer went to the Foreign Exchange office. When asked where the money came from Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer replied truthfully, from Jewish children. “Jews do not need money; Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer will leave money here!” Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer refused to leave money and instead bought - 2 - a ticket to Switzerland which Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer knew Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer would be able to sell. In Bentheim, the Dutch officials got on the train and remained as the train did not stop at the border. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was asked to show the immigration permit for the children. As Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer had no such permits, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was told that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer would have to get off at the next station , take the children back on the first available train and leave the children at the border. The final remark was:” We will then get evens with Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer.” --- It was then that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer understood why the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate had chosen the first available train and this reserved space for the children: Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer found out that the then Princess Juliana and Princess Beatrix were sitting in the adjacent compartment. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer ordered her 6 proteges to tidy her 6 proteges and comb her 6 proteges's hair, then her 6 proteges would all go to see Princess Beatrix. the Dutch officials refused the Dutch officials's permission. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer said:” We will go anyway.” Now the Dutch officials relented a bit and asked: “Should the Dutch officials not first discuss the matter calmly? What are Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer actually intending to do with the children?” “Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer do not know yet!” Then Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer told the Dutch officials the truth. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer explained that the children were very orthodox, that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was taking the children to the Jewish Hospital , then Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer and the Jewish Committee would consider the next step, and on Monday – the next weekday- Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer would go to the Ministry of Justice in the Hague to request the immigration permit for the 6 children from Mr. Temkin. Here were the children's passports. If Mr. Temkin would not give the children the immigration permit for the 6 children, then the children would have to be sent back. the Dutch officials no longer interfered with the Dutch officials's journey after this explanation. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer did achieve the consent of Germany, and the children were allowed to remain in Germany In Hamburg, Frau Wijsmuller had heard, that on 10th November the children of the Koenigsberg orphanage had been thrown out into the street in the cold and the snow. Frau Wijsmuller now obtained permission to let 30 of the children of the Koenigsberg orphanage come to Switzerland. On 29th November in the evening, Frau Wijsmuller , together with Frau van Tyn, travelled to Bentheim where she and the Jewish Committee were to meet up with the children's transport in the morning of 30th November. the Jewish Committee did not have permission to cross the border. the children booked into Hotel Kaiserkrone. A huge SS celebration was in full swing. the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate came over to the children to his invitation the children to the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate's table to participate as the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate's guests. Although the children refused the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate's invitation, the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate returned a short while after and said to Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer “ Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer, may the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate dance with Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's daughter?” “No.” Shortly afterwards the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate came over to Frau W. whom the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate knew and warned Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer: “ Leave immediately, they are planning to imprison Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer.” the children went to the children's room straightaway and locked the door, and the Dutch consul, Baron Artsen, who asked her to come to the consulate made sure that the children were not molested. In the morning, punctually at 5 a.m. , the children were at the railway station to receive the children. Frau Wijsmuller conducted many more small transports across the border. On 2nd December 1938 Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was asked to come to the office of Herr Loeb ( before 1933 Minister in the Ministry of Finance). There, the great bankers of Hamburg were assembled, Herr and Frau Kremarsky, Herr Loeb ( before 1933 Minister in the Ministry of Finance), Frau van Tyn, Prof. Cohen, Herr Asscher and Baron Artsen, Dutch Consul in Hamburg (p.1). The session began at 4 p.m. Baron Artsen, Dutch Consul in Hamburg (p.1) had been to Germany - 3 - and had negotiated with the English Government to achieve immigration permission for children’s transports. Bloomsbury House had given Baron Artsen, Dutch Consul in Hamburg (p.1) assurances that 10,000 Jewish children could be brought to England. “We beg Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer, to travel to Vienna as soon as possible to organise the transports of the children with Eichmann. When can Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer go?” Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer contacted her husband who agreed to Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's immediate departure, and at 6 p.m. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was sitting on the KLM plane on the way to Switzerland. From there Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer had a connection to Vienna on the following day. There was no daily flight from Switzerland to Vienna. (After the war, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was asked in Bentheim to identify Eichmann on photographs. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was unable to do so from photographs. It is thought that Eichmann is still alive, but one does not know where.) On Saturday at noon, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer arrived in Vienna. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's hotel reservation was at Hotel Bristol on the Ring. There Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was immediately requested to donate some money for the winter aid. “What is the purpose of some money for the winter aid?” “some money for the winter aid will be used to help children.” “ Oh, that is splendid, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer can help Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer straightaway, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer am here to save Jewish children.” “ No, some money for the winter aid is not for Jewish children.” So Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer naturally refused to give a donation. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer set off immediately towards the Jewish Quarter in order to find the Community Office. the Jewish Quarter was sealed off with ropes as Jews were not permitted to leave and not even to cross the road. On Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's way to the Palestine Office, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was stopped and locked up in the police station next to the Community Office in the belief that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was Jewish. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer knocked on the door of Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's cell to explain that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was not Jewish. The reaction to Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's knocking was : “Shut up!” When, at last, the door of her cell was opened Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer declared that as soon as Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was released Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer would post in all the newspapers of the world how Aryans were treated in Vienna. The error was deeply regretted , and Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was asked what could be done for Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer asked for an interview with Eichmann to be the arrangement. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was released with the promise that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer would be notified as soon as the arrangement had been made. The policeman kept The policeman's promise and called Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer at the hotel to inform Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer of the time of the meeting: Monday, 5th December, 9.30 a.m. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer used the Sunday to explore Vienna. The houses of the Jews were in ruins. For the winter aid, a particularly big campaign had been organised. Great actors from Switzerland and Rome had arrived for a particularly big campaign , and all sorts of ministers – everyone in uniform – took part in the collection. At the appointed time, on Monday morning, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer appeared at the house of Baron Rothschild, in Prinz-Eugen- Street. This was Eichmann’s headquarters. Upon arrival, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer had the greatest shock of Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's life. In front of the house of Baron Rothschild, in Prinz-Eugen- Street was a queue of Jews who had to line up at the wall. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer witnessed the Gestapo arriving in the Gestapo's cars and simply driving into the people. Those who were not yet dead were beaten with cudgels. - 4 - Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was taken to a huge room at the end of which was a dais. This is where Eichmann’s sat with a large dog and a bright lamp. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer approached Eichmann’s with outstretched hand : “ Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer am Frau Wijsmuller and Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer would like to talk to Eichmann’s.” In response Eichmann’s shouted at Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer:” We are not used to talk to women.” “ What a pity. May Eichmann’s sit down?” Eichmann’s was so taken aback that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer did not shake with fear as Eichmann’s had expected, that Eichmann’s did not stop Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer then explained to Eichmann’s that the British Government in Hamburg had given the English Government's permission for the children to come to England. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer had been asked to discuss with Eichmann’s how this was to be organised. “Do Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer have a letter from the English Government?” “No.” “ Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer would like to see Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's hands. Move up a bit. Lift Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's skirt up a little.” Then Eichmann’s said:” So completely Aryan and so crazy.” Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was allowed to sit down again. Then Eichmann’s rang a bell to summon the Jew Friedmann. Eichmann’s asked the Jew Friedmann Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer know Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer?” “No.” “Do Eichmann’s know the Jew Friedmann?” “No.” Now Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer turned again to the Jew Friedmann. “This will be the biggest joke of our lives. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer does not have a letter from the English Government which would confirm Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's claim that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer has permission to bring children into Germany. We shall organise a transport of the children , and Saturday lunchtime the children will cross the border; that’s when Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer can show us how Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer is going to get the children into Germany.” Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer thanked Eichmann’s and said Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer hoped to meet Eichmann’s again. If Eichmann’s should ever find Eichmann’s in Hamburg, Eichmann’s should visit Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer, just as Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer would come to see Eichmann’s if Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer ever came to Vienna again. In the street, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer asked the Jew Friedmann: “ Who are the Jew Friedmann actually?” “ the Jew Friedmann am in charge of the affairs of the Community Office.” “Will the Jew Friedmann accompany Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer to the hotel so that the Jew Friedmann can phone England?” Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's call to England reached Mrs. Lola Hahn-Warburg whom Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer told that there would be the children at Hook of Holland on Sunday evening. Mrs. Lola Hahn-Warburg whom she told that there would be 600 children at Hook of Holland on Sunday evening was of the opinion that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer had to organise a transport of 600 children. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer explained the situation and that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer could not do this under the circumstances. After 1 ½ hours Mrs. Lola Hahn-Warburg whom she told that there would be 600 children at Hook of Holland on Sunday evening phoned back with the promise that on 11th December the boat “Die Praag” would lie in port at Hook of Holland; “but the children have to be accommodated in England”. The next step was to contact Hamburg and to ask the Jewish Committee to gain the permission from the English Government for the immigration of the children. Then Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer went with the Jew Friedmann to the Community Office and the Palestine Office. the Jewish Community Office and the Palestine Office had to collect the children. A Miss Schwarz had to instruct the children such as teaching the children how to eat and other rules of behaviour. The Jews had to pay for a transport of 600 children The Jews. On the following day Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer travelled to Switzerland. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer addressed Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer to the Jewish Aid Committee in Kantstreet ( Reichsvertretung der Juden in England). the Jewish Aid Committee in Kantstreet ( Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutschland) were angry that a transport from Vienna had already been organised, but not yet from Switzerland. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer promised to collect transports from Switzerland very shortly. Switzerland was, of course, also under Eichmann’s jurisdiction. In Vienna, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer had arranged with the Jewish Community to try and get the German border officials to come to Cologne to prevent too much of a hold-up at the border. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer travelled to England at short notice to talk to the Jewish Community and then went on to Cleves where Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer told the border officials that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer had an agreement with Eichmann - 5 - that a transport was going to leave Vienna on Saturday and arrive in Cologne South on Saturday at noon. the border officials were to go with Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer to Vienna at this point. ( This was not part of Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's arrangement with Eichmann’s.) In Switzerland , the Jewish Community had considered that the Jewish Community would pay the border officials's expenses. the border officials agreed to this. On Sunday 11th December Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer and Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's husband travelled to Vienna. At the South railway station, the border officials were waiting as arranged. The Jewish escorts from Vienna could only accompany she and the Jewish Committee up to the border, but were not allowed to cross the border. A physician, Dr. Engel, was one of The Jewish escorts from Vienna. On taking leave, A physician, Dr. Engel asked Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer if Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer knew that in Jewish cemeteries people laid stones instead of flowers. Here was a small tin containing a stone, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer should always carry a small tin containing a stone with Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer, a small tin containing a stone would bring Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's luck. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer took a small tin containing a stone and , upon arrival, showed a small tin containing a stone to Loeb and Kramarsky who both said that this was nonsense and that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer should throw away a small tin containing a stone. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer could not forget how movingly A physician, Dr. Engel had asked Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer, and so Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer always kept the tin in Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's handbag which Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer took with Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer on all Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's journeys, especially on Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's travels abroad. Four times a week Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer crossed the border in this way. In July 1939 Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer received a letter from Brussels from the relatives of A physician, Dr. Engel asking Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer to send the “diamonds” immediately. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer had never opened the tin which was secured with sticky tape and had therefore no idea that the address of the Brussels relatives was written in the margin of the tin which was secured with sticky tape and even less so that Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was carrying such a “dangerous” lucky stone. the tin which was secured with sticky tape contained two large diamonds. The actual transport went well. The officials came along but only checked a few children. 100 children were accommodated in Switzerland. the Jewish Community had made an arrangement with England that every week a transport of 130 – 150 children from the areas of Vienna , Frankfort, Vienna, Switzerland and Hamburg would leave for England , two transports a week via Vienna and one via Osnabrueck. The border officials who travelled from Vienna to Osnabrueck for the clearance would not take money for The border officials who travelled from Bentheim to Osnabrueck for the clearance's expenses. The journey of The border officials who travelled from Bentheim to Osnabrueck for the clearance from Osnabrueck to Cleves had to be paid for. At first, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer had assistance with the transports from other Christian ladies: Frau van Tyn, van der Mandele, van Plate, van de Zeen , all ladies from Hamburg. Later Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer did everything on Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's own. The Dutch Railway Managers presented Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer with a First Class Season Ticket valid until July 1940. The transports did not only contain Jewish children; there were also mixed transports of Catholic, Protestant and half-Jewish children. Before the Germans marched into Czechoslovakia in March 1939, many Germans had fled into Czechoslovakia. many Germans were mainly Social Democrats and farmers. When the Germans invaded, many of the men in many Germans fled to a Polish port city; the women and children were taken to Concentration Camps. At this period, there was an American Jewish lady in Prague – her name may be found at the Charity Committee in Switzerland – who did a lot for the Sudeten Germans and the Children’s Transports. She was working with the London Charity Committee - 6 - and the London Charity Committee - 6 - managed to get children released from the camps for the transports. Often there were large families of 12 – 14 children . Before 12 – 14 children were able to be transported after leaving the camp 12 – 14 children often had to be nourished for some weeks. Families were also liberated. At Whitsun 1939 Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer and Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's husband stayed in Switzerland. Some of those Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, had saved recognised Mrs Wijsmuller, a Dutch Christian woman, and reported that they would be able to This emigration to Canada as farmers. This emigration took place until 29th August 1939. In August 39 , a major raid took place in Danzig when all the Jews who lived there were collected and Danzig became free of Jews. On 24th August the last transport of Jews escaped to England with the help of the Jewish Community. On 30th August 39 Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer received a call from the Youth Aliyah Switzerland that a transport was ready to go but that the border at Vienna was closed. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer advised the family to come to Cleves where Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer would meet the family on the 31st. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer arrived in Cleves with two tourist buses, having passed soldiers with soldiers with their rifles's rifles at the ready on Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer's way from the border to the railway station. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer got the children onto two tourist buses , took the children to Hook, and on the 31st at 12 o’clock they boarded the boat for England. the boat was the last boat that was able to travel from Hook to England. The next day there was another call from Switzerland that there were still 150 boys to be collected from ORT (an organisation founded in 1880 in St. Petersburg). Again they met up in Cleves. On the 2nd they crossed the border in a train that only had a dining car. The train in direction of Switzerland fortunately had many Dutch carriages all of which had to cross the border. Apart from the children there were also many passengers who wanted to get out of Germany , mainly Englishmen who wanted to go home, but also 300 men from Galicia. The Authorities gave permission for the children and Englishmen who wanted to go home to leave. The Authorities sent the children back. When the ORT (an organisation founded in 1880 in St. Petersburg) leader reported this to Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer, Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer went to see A physician, Dr. Engel and asked:” Where are the children?” Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer really managed to get the children out. Upon arrival in Nymwegen the children were questioned by the police as to how the children were to proceed. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer telephoned Osnabrueck and explained that approximately 700 to 800 people still had to take a boat to England. At 4 o’clock a representative of the shipping company arrived and told Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer that approximately 700 to 800 people could leave on the last boat out of Osnabrueck , but that everybody, including those with First Class tickets, would travel in 3rd class and should be glad to be taken at all. However, none of approximately 700 to 800 people was prepared to tell approximately 700 to 800 people and thus approximately 700 to 800 people would not be available when approximately 700 to 800 people arrived in Osnabrueck during the night; it was up to Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer to tell approximately 700 to 800 people. Usually when transports arrived in Switzerland there were Jewish ladies around to give the children chocolate etc. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer telephoned Switzerland to ask how they should deal with the distribution on this occasion as there were also adults included. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer was advised that the adults should help the adults to something. her 6 proteges took advantage of this and grabbed large packets of all sorts of things. - 7 - In addition, the police asked Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer to get to a huge room at the end of which was a dais immediately as approximately 700 to 800 people were staging a “carnival”. Frau Gertruida Wijsmuller – Meijer understood the situation straightaway and explained to the police that the police were wearing skullcaps and phylacteries in order to say the police's daily prayers.

On the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin's reply the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin was summoned to the Association of Cinema-Owners's office, beaten-up and asked, how the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin dared to doubt the truth of the Association of Cinema-Owners's accusation, as a German would never lie. On the following day, the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin's cinema was closed down by S.A. From then on, the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin was permanently persecuted by men in uniform and people alleging to have claims on the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin, until the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin fled to Holland with the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin's family. Attached : Copy of the letter mentioned above Short curriculum vitae “...A German Does Not Lie” the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin am a native Hungarian and have been living in Germany continuously for 34 years.

Lastly, given that the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin am also familiar with the film and cinema industry, the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin owned a large cinema in Berlin. a large cinema in Berlin was meant to be a good and peaceful existence for me, the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin's only child, and for the author, a well-to-do owner of a large cinema in Berlin's son-in-law; me, my only child, and for my son-in-law were law-abiding citizens and led a happy and contented life. me, my only child, and for my son-in-law thought me, my only child, and for my son-in-law could provide a carefree life for me, my only child, and for my son-in-law's children.

87,"[""In a letter dated 22 November1938, and shortly after the author's flight from Berlin to Amsterdam, the author gives a summary of the anti-Jewish measures and riots which had taken place in Germany since the beginning of 1938, and later in Austria, and which led up to the November Pogrom. The events described, in the author's opinion, clearly indicated the intention of completely destroying German and Austrian Jewries. 8.

November Pogrom 1938: Before and After the author came with the author's wife by plane from Berlin to Amsterdam on that day and am trying in the below to relate from memory the facts which the author personally experienced in the last months or which have been truthfully reported to the author. Since it was impossible to make notes on these events, these events nevertheless need to be written down with certain caveats. The will to lead the Jew problem towards a final liquidation in Germany was noticeable since the start of 1938 and found The will to lead the Jew problem towards a final liquidation in Germany's first decisive expression in the property declaration at the start of this year. The manner in which the declarations were demanded of the Jews and within which the capitalization of small and the smallest pensions formed a crucial part demonstrated a willingness to estimate Jewish assets as high as possible. The manner in which the declarations were demanded of the Jews and within which the capitalization of small and the smallest pensions formed a crucial part was followed by the deprivation of tax reliefs of any kind for Jews (reductions for children, taxation for Jewish charity institutions etc.), the deprivation of the public-law characteristic of the Jewish communities and the related, no longer possible, forced tax collection of Jewish taxes, which became voluntary. The installation of the so-called ‘yellow benches’ was only a small prick of a needle. The radical current received The radical current's actual impetus through the invasion of Austria. The increase of the Jewish population and the fact that all the measures which in the old Reich had been introduced over the course of five years were caught up within a few weeks and within the ‘flush of victory’ took hold of the old Reich. The known revival of the boycott occurred, as did the marking of Jewish shops by the writing of the full name of the Jewish owner on the shop windows, and the creation of lists at police stations. The next blow was the mid-June arrest-affaire through which around 3000 people were put into concentration camps, of whom 146 had already died before 30 September in the Buchenwald Camp near Weimar. Further measures led to the deactivation of the Jewish doctors, of whom in total around 1200 (of these around 400 each in Berlin and Vienna) were or are meant to be re-licensed as Jewish administrators of treatment to the sick and of whom now again a large number have been arrested. The withdrawal of so-called legitimation cards, city peddling licenses etc. destroyed the existence of further thousands of families. The deactivation of the lawyers occurred on 1/12, and the prohibition of retail trade and commercial operations by 1 January. - 2 - Administrative measures occurred at the same time, such as the divestment of passports, the stamping of emigration passports with a big red J, the divestment of weapons, the special marking of cars owned by Jews, the forced introduction of the first names Sara and Israel and the introduction of the identity card with fingerprint and a clearly visible left ear. A great number of less important measures is doubtlessly not included within this line-up. I will now begin to set out the crucial development of the last weeks. The Czechoslovak problem, which at the same time promised to bring new ‘pressure’ for the Jews due to the Jewish communities within the Sudeten-German area, visibly led to deterrence measures aimed at leading the Jewish population to a voluntary evacuation. There are reports from a trustworthy source that in the case of mobilisation, the SA would be this measure a ‘night of long knives’ on the day of mobilisation. The decisions on this measure are said to have been made at the party convention in September. That reports from a trustworthy source is founded is evidenced in that on the day of mobilisation, there occurred pogrom-like riots in smaller places, which were especially severe in in Bavaria (Rothenburg ob der Tauber) and in the areas of Hesse and Hesse-Nassau, where the news of the cancelled mobilisation had clearly not made it on time. Severe abuse occurred in Rothenburg ob der Tauber and other Bavarian places as well as the Hesse area. The Jews were expelled from Rothenburg ob der Tauber and other places within 24 hours and found shelter with friends or family in bigger cities of the old Reich. In a small town in the Mark [either all of Austria which the Nazis referred to as ‘Ostmark’, the Steiermark in southern Austria, or Brandenburg] the Synagogue was completely destroyed and the Jewish population, was arrested and only let go after around eight days. The justification for this measure was given as the intended prevention of the foreign press getting hold of news of this. A synagogue was broken into at night in Langen near Frankfurt on the Main, religious objects were stolen and the entrance door walled up. The next morning a policeman went to the provost of the Jewish population and said that a master builder had received the order to open the door again, and that the provost of the community should hand over the key to the iron gate. This did occur. A short time afterward the state police appeared and arrested the provost of the community because the provost of the community had had A synagogue re-opened arbitrarily. There is no indication to suggest that the state police had been working with the state police. Rather it seems as though the state police was indeed acting with goodwill. In another place near Frankfurt on the Main - Seligenstadt on the Main, if I am not mistaken - ropes were stretched on Friday evening over the street through which the Jews walked to A synagogue so that the Jews tripped and fell to the ground to the amusement of the adolescent spectators. - 3 - At the same time the more or less forced expropriation of real estate at ridiculous prices started especially in Bavarian areas. A random pretended buyer was sent to the Jewish real estate owner in question and forced A random pretended buyer to sell A random pretended buyer's land to the given price by threatening to arrest A random pretended buyer otherwise. These methods were used even in a city like Wuerzburg. A lot of real estate which belonged to the Jewish communities was expropriated in These methods, too. Synagogues were confiscated and turned into granaries etc.. In those days they though up a special method in Berlin in order to keep the Jewish population in constant disquiet and to make the Jewish population brittle. At one point there occurred numerous raids of cafes, and there was also a raid of the only lido near Berlin (Stoelpchensee) which still allowed Jews to enter. People who could prove People who could prove their legitimacy's legitimacy were generally not being bothered, but it differed completely what was taken as legitimation. In some cases showing even an out-of-date passport was sufficient. In other cases this was seen as a severe trespassing which led to arrest, even though a decree to hand in out-of-date passports had not been made at that time; a decree to hand in out-of-date passports was only made on 15/10. Those people who were arrested would generally be released again after two to three days. In relation to such raids the head of the police station Grolmannsrasse in Berlin-Charlottenburg, a Polizeihauptmann Schneider, excelled especially. It is said of the head of the police that the head of the police is [p.3] a brother-in-law of the head of the German police, General Daluege. the head of the police was also the first to install the so-called traffic-traps for pedestrians. the so-called traffic-traps for pedestrians were situated at areas with especially much traffic, such as the crossing between Rothenburg ob der Tauber and Uhlandstrasse, Rothenburg ob der Tauber and Leibnizstrasse, and Rothenburg ob der Tauber and Wilmersdorferstrasse. Pedestrians who crossed the street incorrectly, or, as was mostly the case, allegedly incorrectly, were stopped and asked whether Pedestrians who crossed the street incorrectly, or, as was mostly the case, allegedly incorrectly were Jews or non-Jews. If Pedestrians who crossed the street incorrectly, or, as was mostly the case, allegedly incorrectly were non-Jews, Pedestrians who crossed the street incorrectly, or, as was mostly the case, allegedly incorrectly were let go or given the usual police fine of 1 Reichsmark. If, however, Pedestrians who crossed the street incorrectly, or, as was mostly the case, allegedly incorrectly were Jews, Pedestrians who crossed the street incorrectly, or, as was mostly the case, allegedly incorrectly were taken to the police station, kept there for at least half a day and given a penalty order between 50 and 300 Reichsmark, with which Pedestrians who crossed the street incorrectly, or, as was mostly the case, allegedly incorrectly were considered to have a criminal record and lived in constant fear of being arrested as a ‘criminal’ during a raid. This was indeed the justification for the arrests in June this year, which were based on a law according to which felons could be taken into preventative custody at any time. The people who were arrested at that time had to sign a form with that content! The same control extended to Jewish cars, which had received numbers above 350 000 to make Jewish cars, which had received numbers above 350 000 to make them immediately recognisable immediately recognisable. Most Jewish car owners therefore ceased to use Most Jewish car owners's cars which meant a considerable burden due to the distances in terms of the course of business in Berlin. These traffic traps in the West caught on and new ones were set up notably at the Antonplatz in Weissensee where the Jewish visitors to the cemetery had to cross the street, and in the Iranische Strasse in front of the Jewish hospital. One can easily imagine - 4 - the numerousness of the violations of traffic rules when people who were filled with suffering and worries went or came from the cemetery or the Jewish hospital. The institution of yellow benches was also intensified. Whereas Jews could still use normal benches in areas where no such benches existed, signs with the following writing “For Jews in the administrative district….only the yellow benches marked with J are allowed to be used” began to be set up. Hence Jews could only use the few yellow benches. When the incident in Amsterdam occurred[1], the incident in Antwerpen already looked as though the incident in Antwerpen was meant to be used as a trigger to implement the planned big action. However, Jews first limited Jews to the prohibition of all Jewish events. the prohibition of all Jewish events included courses and language courses of teaching institutions which were about to start their autumn semester and for which numerous listeners had already travelled from the countryside into the cities. courses and language courses of teaching institutions which were about to start their autumn semester and for which numerous listeners had already travelled from the countryside into the cities were mostly so-called intensive courses of eight hours a day for four weeks. Only the Kulturbundtheater was allowed to continue Only the Kulturbundtheater's performances. The campaign of rent terminations of housing also started. rent terminations of housing were conducted according to the Viennese method in their thousands and created the greatest level of confusion in Jewish circles, since alternative housing was hardly to be obtained due to the current lack of rooms. Especially aggravating results had a campaign which started the labour front and which forced the owners of Jewish inns through greater or lesser levels of coercion to sell, thereby making especially many older people homeless and through which it was made almost impossible for the numerous doctors, who as is known had their rent terminated within six weeks through an extraordinary law, (p.4) to seek preliminary shelter in inns. All these measures had already led to a total despondency among the Jewish population. The consultation times of the Jewish charities (Hilfsverein, Central-Verein, Palaestina-Amt) were overcrowded with people who could hardly be given any advice since the immigration countries had closed the immigration countries one after the other due to the increased emigration push and due to the forced illegal emigration. The advisors in the Jewish institutions increasingly became pastoral care-givers who had to detain people from desperate steps. In this situation it turned out not to be unfortunate that the above named three institutions were still able to work alongside each other but in a complimentary manner. The final act of the German Jew tragedy was introduced through the Poland campaign. In the night of the 27 and 28 October between the hours of 4 and 7 am, all male Jewish Polish citizens over 16 were arrested (in the countryside at times - 5 - also women and children) and moved to the border in collective transports. The German Jews saw this as only the prelude to the lot which threatened The German Jews. It is therefore even more astonishing that The German Jews managed to within a few hours provide victuals at the train stations, for example in Berlin and Berlin, to thousands of Polish Jews before thousands of Polish Jews's deportation to the border, and that the same happened when a part of these unfortunate people where transported back in a completely exhausted state due the measures which had by then been introduced by the Polish government. The Jewish community Berlin even undertook to pay for part of the transport costs ( 60 000 Reichsmark, if I am not mistaken) and to let a part of these unfortunate people where get back to a part of these unfortunate people where's places of residence. It might well be unique in Jewish history that the readiness to help showed itself in this way although it should also not be forgotten that the difference of level between western and easter European Jews and these resulting tensions had of course not disappeared in Germany either. The Amsterdam assassination occurred during this tense atmosphere. No Jew in Germany doubted that the worst events were now to be expected. However, no Jew could even guess that the consequences would be of such a cruelly exterminating manner. It is well-known that the first days after The Paris assassination were quiet. There were no riots. The speech which Hitler gave in the evening of 8 November in the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich did not mention the Jew problem with a single word, so that one could hope that although the measures which were to be expected would not not take place, but that the measures which were to be expected would be dictated with deliberation rather than through the initial excitement. On Tuesday, that day followed the prohibition of the entire Jewish press in Germany, which on that day consisted of three major newspapers (C.V. Zeitung (circulation of 40 000), Jüdische Rundschau (circulation of 26 000), Israelitisches Familienblatt (circulation 25 000), around 25 community papers, among them that of Berlin with a circulation of 40 000, 4 papers of Jewish cultural federations (Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt on the Main, Cologne), the papers of the Jewish women federation, the Reich-federation of Jewish soldiers fighting at the front, (p.5) the ‘Morgen’, the historical magazine of the history of the Jews in Germany, the ‘Makkabi' and some other smaller papers. Such prohibitions of the Jewish press tended to be a prelude to antisemitic excesses in general, as this severed the connection among the Jews, and every means of information was stopped. On Wednesday 9 November the editors in chief of the those newspapers which were published in Berlin were ordered to come to the stapo [Gestapo?] on Alexanderplatz at 10 am on Thursday 10/11. On Wednesday evening Von Rath died. On Wednesday evening and during the night between Wednesday and Thursday 10/11 the organized mob in civilian clothes moved from East Berlin into the center and to the West and systematically this vandalistic work of destruction - 6 - all Jewish shops. Since they were marked out, this vandalistic work of destruction was easily doable without endangering non-Jewish shops. this vandalistic work of destruction was thorough. Not a single remained in place. The goods were thrown on to the street, The goods were torn and mostly stolen. At almost the same time the synagogues in Berlin and in the old Reich were set ablaze. The fire brigade limited The fire brigade to protect surrounding buildings and the police disappeared wherever the rampaging crowd appeared so as not to hinder the looters. the rampaging crowd in most cases remained completely silent, i.e. opposed. There were single expressions of disapproval. the rampaging crowd were stopped as such persons were arrested. The destruction rage continued in Berlin and in the old Reich on Thursday 10/11, too. The destruction rage was replaced by a wave of arrests, which, according to my estimations, affected at least 10 000 Jewish men aged between 16 and 60. On Thursday 10/11 morning, following the trespassing into and the partial destruction of the Palaestina-Amt and the rooms of the Zionistische Vereinigung für Deutschland, the Jewish organizations in Berlin had closed the Jewish organizations in Berlin's buildings of the Jewish organizations in Berlin's own volition. Only the Central-Verein continued an emergency service comprising around 15 people. As mentioned above, of Only the Central-Verein's heads of department, Dr Alfred Hirschberg, Dr Ernst G. Loewenthal, and Frau Dr Eva Reihmann-Jungmann had been ordered to come to the state police as representatives of the pressthat morning. The reporter/rapporteur, as well as the club’s syndic, Dr Hans Reichmann and the colleagues Dr Werner Rosenstock, previous district court councillor Dr Fritz Goldschmidt, retired director of governance Friedlaender were on duty. Reports of serious, including physical excesses in the countryside increased by the hour, at times with deadly outcomes. Shortly after 13:00 three plain clothed state police officials appeared, occupied the telephone centre and moved those present from all rooms. three plain clothed state police officials had to put on hats and coats, were briefly examined and then let go individually. The rooms of Only the Central-Verein were sealed, and the keys to all rooms and the keys to the safe were handed over to three plain clothed state police officials. None of those present was arrested. The tone during the Poland campaign was vigorous but proper. Only occasionally words such as ‘you will see what will happen’, ‘you will soon stop laughing’ (of course, no one was laughing) and so on were used. The reporter/rapporteur went to Dr Alfred Hirschberg's apartment and waited there for The reporter/rapporteur's return. Dr Alfred Hirschberg return occurred around 16:00. All of the other editors, too, had been released. All of the other editors had been held from 8 am until then without any (p.6) interrogation - 7 - or anything else happening, All of the other editors were then sent home and ordered to return on Friday morning at 10 am. By then it had become clear that the numerous arrests mostly affected wealthier people, lawyers, doctors and leading Jewish persons. Thus the numerous arrests was evidently intended to remove all those people who could have advised or calmed down Jewish people in those agitated days. The flight of Jewish men from Jewish men's apartments started. Jewish men mostly slept in households without men, traveled to the countryside, hid in the forests, and by night travelled to and fro on the underground and city trains. The dismissal of the editors followed on Thursday 10/11 around 13:00. the editors had to sign an indemnity according to which the editors's newspaper was prohibited for three months. While we were waiting for the return of Dr Alfred Hirschberg in Dr Alfred Hirschberg's apartment, relieved, as Dr Alfred Hirschberg had just telephoned, the criminal police arrived to arrest Dr Alfred Hirschberg. While we were still negotiating with the criminal police and in turn were examined, Dr Alfred Hirschberg appeared in his apartment. Dr Alfred Hirschberg explained that Dr Alfred Hirschberg had just been released and following Dr Alfred Hirschberg's explanation the criminal police called the police headquarters. However, it was in vain. Dr Alfred Hirschberg was arrested. Dr Hans Reichman, who had been released in Wednesday evening had already been taken from Dr Hans Reichman, who had been released in the morning's apartment the previous day. Nevertheless, the criminal police searched for Dr Hans Reichman, who had been released in the morning twice in his apartment over the course of Thursday 10/11. Not all men between 16 and 60 were being arrested in Berlin. It seems that as in June, the police stations had been ordered to arrest a set number of people and to focus on intellectuals and wealthy people this time. This view is supported in the following case, amongst others: the police stations searched for one of my colleagues in one of my colleagues in his apartment's apartment on Thursday 10/11 and did not find one of my colleagues in his apartment there. one of my colleagues in his apartment's Aryan wife was threatened with arrest unless His Aryan wife's husband was there by the following morning. Following my advice her husband did go home and waited for her husband's arrest. However, her husband was not taken and I have received a letter dated 20 November from her husband here. It is likely that another was taken in his place to fulfill the quota. A while ago Jewish blind people, including those blinded in war, were deprived of Jewish blind people, including those blinded in war's discounts for public transport. The Jewish Institution for the Blind in Berlin had to lay off The Jewish Institution for the Blind in Berlin's Jewish city agents, who sold basket and woven goods to the Jewish customers, by 1 October as The Jewish Institution for the Blind in Berlin no longer received legitimation cards. The Institution for the Blind was asked - 8 - to employ Aryan representatives. The hand over of weapons ,which generally was only decreed by a law after 9 November, occurred in various forms since around the start of October. In general there was a summons to the police station at a certain time. Some stations, however, ordered several hundred people to come at the same time and let several hundred people wait for hours in gyms or courtyards, until each was asked about the weapon, driver’s license for cars and any other legitimation papers. A police station in North East Berlin ordered the men to report several times a day at 7 am, at 12 noon and in the afternoon in September at the time of the important Jewish holidays. Thus people with small businesses, who naturally had to close people with small businesses, who naturally had to close their shops during that time's shops during that time, could not conduct people with small businesses, who naturally had to close their shops during that time's businesses for days. During the hand over of weapons, which included duel rapiers, sport rapiers, and army pistols whose purchases by their owners was compulsory during the war, an indemnity had to be signed stating that the hand over of weapons, which included duel rapiers, sport rapiers, and army pistols whose purchases by their owners was compulsory during the war was voluntary. Of course, no kind of compensation was paid. It is probably not necessary to be pointed out that every Jew who still owned a weapon had the necessary licence. One has to understand that the laws of 9 November meant the complete material ruin of the German Jewry. The following example shows how the complete material ruin of the German Jewry impacted on even small issues. Families who were emigrating in general tended to sell Families who were emigrating's furniture. From the revenue Families who were emigrating either bought small new furniture items which were especially suited for emigration, or Families who were emigrating paid for the passage and cargo into Germany. Over the last years, the dissolution of households within the normal scope had already decreased the prices on the old furniture market significantly. Through the Poland acton a repeated depression occurred. These days it is likely that thousands of households are suddenly being dissolved in Germany, and no price at all can be reached for furniture, books, pictures, carpets, etc., and through this the material basis for emigration of numerous families have been destroyed. It is easy to construct parallel cases in different areas through The following example. I know the following details about the demolition of the synagogue in Berlin and of the community building in Herzog-Maxstrasse in Berlin. Councillor Neumeyer of the upper-state court (‘Oberstlandesgerichtsrat’) was asked to come to the Home Office where Councillor Neumeyer of the upper-state court (‘Oberstlandesgerichtsrat’) was told that the demolition of the synagogue would start the next day. They demanded a declaration from Councillor Neumeyer of the upper-state court (‘Oberstlandesgerichtsrat’), or rather from the Jewish population, by that evening stating that the Jewish population agreed to the demolition of the synagogue. a declaration was not handed in in the from which had been demanded. There remained just about 12 hours during the night to retrieve the religious objects from the synagogue. the Jewish population was offered a purchase price - 9 - of, as far as I can remember, 300 000 Reichsmark for the synagogue and the community building in Herzog-Maxstrasse in Munich, whereas the construction costs alone, exclusive of property, in the Jewish population's time had been 1 million Reichsmark. The value of the estate had increased every year since the synagogue and the community building are situated at an especially convenient location within Berlin. The demolition of the synagogue was completed in just about 14 days and a car park was built there for the opening of the German art exhibition. Voice from the people: on a holiday in September a young Jewish woman exited A synagogue and petted a small dog on the street. Upon this the woman who owned a small dog cried out: ‘a young Jewish woman, do not engage with the Jews and stay an honest dog.’ In the last months the cases in which the Aryan wives of Jewish men were summoned to the state police to put the Aryan wives of Jewish men under varying levels of pressure to divorce the Aryan wives of Jewish men's husbands increased. A small example of the cases in which the Aryan wives of Jewish men were summoned to the state police to put them under varying levels of pressure to divorce their husbands is the following: During the business Aryanisation in the well-known Rosenhain shop on Kurfürstendamm in Berlin, an Aryan employee married to a Jewish man [the text is unclear here] and who had converted to Judaism at an Aryan employee married to a Jewish man [the text is unclear here] and who had converted to Judaism at her wedding's wedding, had been brought to leave Judaism again so that an Aryan employee married to a Jewish man [the text is unclear here] and who had converted to Judaism at her wedding could keep an Aryan employee married to a Jewish man [the text is unclear here] and who had converted to Judaism at her wedding's employment. A few days afterwards an Aryan employee married to a Jewish man [the text is unclear here] and who had converted to Judaism at her wedding was nevertheless laid off because an Aryan employee married to a Jewish man [the text is unclear here] and who had converted to Judaism at her wedding had not dissolved her wedding and therefore the sign ‘we march in closed ranks in the labour front’ could not be installed. an Aryan employee married to a Jewish man [the text is unclear here] and who had converted to Judaism at her wedding could not be accepted in the labour front because an Aryan employee married to a Jewish man [the text is unclear here] and who had converted to Judaism at her wedding was still married to a Jew. On the other hand, the Jewish population had refused to give the Jewish husband a temporary job because the Jewish husband's wife had left Judaism. With respect to the Jewish population, the matter could, of course, be solved after a while. [1] Note by WL staff - In October 1938 two Nazis photographed Belgian Jews who had pronounced looks on a street in Berlin. two Nazis were asked to stop by a Dutch Jew who lived in Berlin. This caused a storm amongst two Nazis and led to a robust exchange of letters with the Belgian Foreign Office.

Die Geschichte Meiner Flucht in die Schweiz From autumn 1941 every Jew in Berlin had to wear the star, and later (1942) the star also had to be pinned to the corridor door, immediately by the bell. Whenever the bell rang, we would freeze in terror, and nobody dared open the corridor door. One evening at 8.30 – we always had to be home from 8 o’clock on – a policeman and a Gestapo man came round checking whether all the tenants were in the building. Then a policeman and a Gestapo man inspected our larder to see if we had anything we were not allowed – fruit other than simple basics, vegetables, Wurst. - In February 1942 Meiner's husband died, and after that a policeman and a Gestapo man began deporting Meiner's subtenants at intervals. a policeman and a Gestapo man sealed the rooms, but Meiner had to go on paying Meiner's full rent. Meiner had Meiner's foster-daughter living with Meiner, Dr. Georgette Schüler, we called her foster-daughter Georgette Schueler “Go”. her foster-daughter Georgette Schueler was a fully qualified schoolteacher[1]. In mid-August 42 her foster-daughter Georgette Schueler received the “Kündigung” (deportation notice), meaning her foster-daughter Georgette Schueler would be taken away in the next three days. We knew that this meant death. Meiner then moved out on Meiner's advice and went into hiding with a Christian friend, Luise Jonas, a piano teacher. While there a Christian friend, Luise Jonas, a piano teacher was told by a Miss v. Thadden that it was possible to escape through Bavaria and Tyrol to Germany. a Christian friend, Luise Jonas, a piano teacher gave a Christian friend, Luise Jonas, a piano teacher the address of a friend, Mrs Inge von Scherpenberg, at Hubertushof, near Weilheim, in Bavaria. We only heard later that a friend, Mrs Inge von Scherpenberg, at Hubertushof, near Weilheim, in Bavaria was the daughter of Hjalmar Schacht. Meiner had actually felt Meiner was fairly safe, as Meiner's friend Elisabeth Hoffer had introduced Meiner to a Justizrat[2] Bollert, who had links to Gestapo. Meiner gave a Justizrat[2] Bollert, who had links to the Gestapo 300 marks, and a Justizrat[2] Bollert, who had links to the Gestapo told Meiner a Justizrat[2] Bollert, who had links to the Gestapo had slipped 300 marks to a Gestapo member who in return had removed Meiner's card from the district card index. But one day a subtenant of Meiner, Trude Feiertag (formerly Kaputh), who worked in that department, came home and said: “Meiner, Meiner are in danger.” Now we quickly made our preparations for flight. Through a former pupil, Oberregierungsrat[3] Dr. Franz Kaufmann, Meiner obtained a pass issued by Gestapo (a pass issued by the SS (it cost 2000 marks) cost 2000 marks). 2000 marks, and a lot more in addition, was placed at Meiner disposal by 2 former female colleagues. As for Meiner, Meiner had no photo identity card, only ration cards without the letter “j” and a doctor’s certificate that said Meiner needed to travel to Tyrol to recuperate from a serious illness. Frau Inge von Scherpenberg had obtained a doctor’s certificate that said I needed to travel to Tyrol to recuperate from a serious illness for Meiner from an acquaintance, under whose name Meiner now travelled. Meiner was not ill, but had lost weight, having taken off 50 pounds before Meiner moved in. We would have to move very fast. It was early October when we started, and in the mountains the snow was expected to start falling by mid-month: the escape might not come off. On 8 October we were ready to go. Frau Inge von Scherpenberg had bought the tickets for us. You had to show your identity card, Jews would not be sold tickets. Frau Inge von Scherpenberg and Frau Inge von Scherpenberg collected our bags. Meiner left the building still wearing the Jew star, walked as far as the radio tower, then pulled the Jew star off Meiner's coat and threw the Jew star down the drain. Then on to the Anhalter Bahnhof, where the 3 ladies (Meiner and the 3 ladies (Go and our 2 friends)'s 2 friends) were waiting. The two of us took the night train to Munich, separately. The other two had once again risked their lives – as they always did, every time they came to visit Meiner at home. In Munich we took the risk of boarding the Weilheim train together, and from there we went on on the narrow-gauge railway to Hohen-Peissenberg. With an icy wind blowing, we found our way to Hubertushof, which was quite a small property. A tall blonde lady came to the door. “We bring greetings from a former pupil, Oberregierungsrat[3] Dr. Franz Kaufmann.” “Ah, Jewish?” Yes. “Come in.” In our first conversation with A tall blonde lady it turned out that we were not going to get the guide we had been promised for crossing the frontier, - 2 - but would have to tackle this entirely on our own. A tall blonde lady used A tall blonde lady's hands to show us the position of the mountain: “From Nauders (Tirol) you have to make your way over the Norbertshöhe. Keep going west, don’t put yourselves in danger by going down too soon, you have to get a long way past the German frontier post of Martinsbrück on your right.” We rested for two nights at Hubertushof, which was quite a small property and then went on to Innsbruck and Landeck, and from there to Nauders (Tirol) by bus. Frequent identity checks, Meiner cover (Grete Schlüter, researching holiday homes for Berlin children) was strong. Meiner was repeatedly barked at – did Meiner not realise Meiner had to have a proper identity card? But they let Meiner go. In N. we had difficulty finding a lodging, then had to pay for a week in advance. Losing no time, we headed for the Norbertshöhe and were just about to slip into the forest, when the German Grenzer (border patrol) came out of the forest. Where are Meiner going? Can you not read? There were notices everywhere saying „Prohibited Path!“ Meiner papers were carefully scrutinised, then we asked him, all innocent, where the great viewpoint was here, that we had heard about. Meiner showed us how to get to the great viewpoint. And we sat there on a stone bench and saw the Promised Land in front of us, the Engadine, and wanted to go down there, and we were being watched. The border guard waited until we stood up to go, then accompanied us back to the village and - left us!! “We’re as good as dead already,” said Meiner. We were sure Meiner would report us to the police. We were utterly resolved to take our own lives. So many of those we loved had already done that. But how. We pondered for 2 days and nights. On the 3rd morning Meiner found a Cologne newspaper in the hotel and said to Meiner: If Meiner find a familiar name in a Cologne newspaper in the hotel, we’ll face up to the danger and try again. Meiner opened a Cologne newspaper in the hotel, and the first name Meiner came across was: Katowice! Meiner's old home! Off we go! We left everything, simply put on two layers of underwear, warm coats. We were lucky with the weather: no snow (16 October), the sun was shining. We needed that, as we had no compass. For the first part of the morning we steered by the tree shadows. Tyrol’s the mountain we have to cross! Yes, but there’s barbed wire everywhere. Back on the road: barbed wire here too. Then, suddenly, a break in the road, a ravine led uphill. a ravine was full of brushwood and dead branches. Up there, quick quick, up at the top a ravine’s forested, we’ll be safe. And now in dense forest, wending between the trees, avoiding roads and tracks, always going by the tree shadows, heading west. From time to time we glimpsed the opposite valley wall and guessed that the young river Inn would be flowing between there and where we were. After several hours, never stopping, we spotted the fortified (German) frontier post at Martinsbrück, already quite far down to our right in the valley. But we didn’t dare go down yet. At last, towards evening, we decided the fortified (German) frontier post at Martinsbrück, already quite far down to our right in the valley would be safe now. We headed down. It was tricky, wearing town shoes. The slopes were covered in slippery fir-needles, and we slid down more than we walked. In the end Meiner simply sat down on the ground and let Meiner slither from tree to tree. At long last Meiner was standing below Meiner on the bank of the young river Inn; Meiner was up on a rock, tried to join Meiner, jumped – and felt something tear in Meiner's knee. The pain was terrible. Meiner dragged Meiner on. A woman was at work in the fields. “Are we in Tyrol or in Germany?” “In Germany!” We sighed in delight, but where exactly we had crossed the frontier we do not know. We were on the point of crossing over a little bridge to the other bank when some German soldiers on motor-bikes roared by on the other bank. We hid in the bushes and waited for some German soldiers on motor-bikes to pass again on some German soldiers on motor-bikes's way back to Martinsbrück. Then we crossed, slowly and stiffly, and made our way further into Germany. We were in sight of - 3 - houses in the little village of Strada when we met a Swiss border patrol man coming the other way on a Swiss border patrol man coming the other way on his bicycle's bicycle. “Where have a Swiss border patrol man coming the other way on his bicycle come from?” “Germany. We escaped.” “Meiner's papers!” Meiner produced Meiner's National Socialist identity card. “Well then, why did Meiner escape “Your papers are forged.” - “In that case, where are the real ones?; We extracted our sewn-in identity cards with the “J” from the collars of our coats and handed our sewn-in identity cards over. a Swiss border patrol man coming the other way on his bicycle was very suspicious of us, it was obvious. a Swiss border patrol man coming the other way on his bicycle accompanied us to the little village post office, told us to wait, and went inside. We saw a Swiss border patrol man coming the other way on his bicycle telephoning. a Swiss border patrol man coming the other way on his bicycle was reporting to the cantonal police in Nauders (Tirol). We shook with fear. We had been warned back in Berlin that the Swiss sent all refugees back, to certain death. a Swiss border patrol man coming the other way on his bicycle came out but would not give us any information. What will happen to us? “Just go to the Hotel Post and wait for the bus to come!” We trudged to the Hotel Post. A very nice girl gave us bread and milk, and asked: What did a Swiss border patrol man coming the other way on his bicycle say? We are to wait for the bus. – Yes, there are two – one comes from Martinsbrück and goes to Hohen-Peissenberg, the other one comes from there and goes to the frontier! – And there we sat for 1½ hours, not knowing whether we would be allowed to remain or would be sent back to Germany. This was the worst part of the whole escape. After 1½ hours A very nice girl came back and said: “The bus to Martinsbrück has gone through!” And 5 minutes later a Swiss border patrol man coming the other way on his bicycle called us out, on the vehicle a Swiss border patrol man coming the other way on his bicycle said: To Hohen-Peissenberg – and off we rode through the evening darkness. Neither of us could quite grasp it – that we were now safe. Safe from what? That – we could only surmise. In Sch.-T. police officers were waiting for us, and took us first to see a doctor. We could after all have been bringing in some disease. The doctor, a delightful man, bound up Meiner's knee. “Meiner’ve torn a ligament!”, a doctor said. a doctor told us: “Meiner can be thankful Meiner didn’t arrive 4 weeks ago. all refugees would be sent back. A lot of people got angry about that, through the newspapers, and now A lot of people look into each case individually.” Next, we were taken to a small hotel where we were given a good hot meal such as we had not enjoyed in years, and a small bedroom for the night. At 6 o’clock the next morning we met the police officer at the Hotel Post, and the police officer at the station escorted us to Nauders (Tirol). The beauty of the Upper Engadine could give us no real enjoyment. When we get to the canton police HQ in Nauders (Tirol), what will the canton police HQ in Chur do with us? Well, several gentlemen questioned us for hours. Not just about our personal experiences. several gentlemen also wanted to know what the food situation in Germany was like, what the German people thought about things, etc. – Eventually several gentlemen took us to the Rhätisches Volkshaus, which was a large, fairly basic hotel, and handed us over to the manageress, Anny Ackermann, who was to provide us with board and lodging until further notice. Meiner even got a visit from a doctor, who had been sent to treat Meiner's knee. We walked the streets of Nauders (Tirol) as if in a dream, marvelled at the well-stocked shops, exchanged our smuggled 2,000 marks for 200 francs and sent telegrams to Meiner's daughter and brother in London. On the third day the police came to collect us and we were on our way again, to Innsbruck, then on to the camp at Adliswil. That was the reverse side of the coin, it was worse than our worst fears. But still, but still – we were safe. A lot could be said about our 3½ year stay in Germany, but it would be too much for here. A few Jews and a few Christians tried to make life rather more pleasant for us. We still keep touch with A few Jews and a few Christians. [1] fr.

89,"[""The author was actively engaged in political activities as a member of the SPD and other organisations of anti-Nazi attitude. The author was employed at the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten (p.1) in Munich (p.1-2, 5-8) and reports on several leading Nazis The author saw there. From the year 1931, when The author was 19, The author was a waiter with the Mitropa Dining Car Company and would smuggle into Germany anti-Nazi newspapers and leaflets which were much appreciated by The author's political friends in and around Munich. One day, the police came to arrest The author in The author's father's house, but as The author had received a warning, The author was already well on The author's way to Eger (p.2-3, 10), hidden in the store room of the restaurant car. The author held a German passport and found it rather difficult to stay in Czechoslovakia for a time unlimited. Until April 1934 The author was living in a hospital and later was helped by the SPD officials. The author was working for the Resistance near the German frontier sometimes crossing the German frontier. One day, while The author waited by the border-station Bayrisch Eisenstein - Zelezna Ruda (p.3-4) for some underground workers from Munich, The author was grabbed by three men about twelve feet inside Czechoslovakia; a Czech policeman who intervened was knocked down. Ill-treated with unbelievable brutality, The author was taken to Munich to the Gestapo HQ at the Wittelsbacher Palais (p.5-7) and then to a small cell at Police Headquarters (p.6). During the interrogations The author tried to lay the blame on a captain of the Czech Intelligence and a German agent provocateur called Huber, late of Starnberg (p.3, 6). The author resisted the opportunity to escape which was obviously a trap. Visited by The author's sister; arrest of The author's father (p.8). The author refused to make certain declarations over the radio (p.7-8). What finally helped The author to freedom and brought The author safely back to Czechoslovakia was the interest The author's case had aroused in the World Press (p.6-10). Accompanied by high officials sent for this purpose from Munich, The author was taken to the frontier in a German car (p.8-9). 9. Further References : “Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold” (p.1).

A Notorious Case of Kidnapping In 1928 at the age of 16 The author was actively engaged in political activities, as a member of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) the “Reichsbanner, Schwarz-Rot-Gold” a uniformed Protection Guard against Nazi-attacks and the German Trade Union (ADGB) political activities centred mostly against the Nazi-party (NSDAP) and the Nazi-party (NSDAP)'s political organisations of military standing, such as the SA and SS. During this period The author was employed in the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten in Munich from 1927 until 1931 and The author had ample opportunities to obtain firsthand knowledge of the Nazi-Hirarchy, which were residing many times in the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten in Munich. the Nazi-Hirarchy, which were residing many times in the above mentioned hotel included besides Hitler and Goering, party members such as Hess, Roehm, Streicher, Hanfstängl and many others. Hitler spent many hours in the tearoom, where Hitler conferred with Herr Bechstein, owner of the famous Bechstein Piano Works and financial baker of the “Voelkischer Beobachter” the daily newspaper of the Nazi-party (NSDAP), and also with Hitler's daughter Fraulein Bechstein who had female ambitions, not always appreciated by Hitler, especially at times when the then famous Operetta Star from Vienna Gretel Slezak was appearing in the Gaertnerplatz Theatre and staying in Room 208 in the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten in Munich. the then famous Operetta Star from Vienna Gretel Slezak rceived daily a bunch of red roses from Hitler, which were not always appreciated by the then famous Operetta Star from Vienna Gretel Slezak, as the then famous Operetta Star from Vienna Gretel Slezak neither liked Hitler, nor did the then famous Operetta Star from Vienna Gretel Slezak keep arranged dates by Hitler. - 2 - Hauptman Goering indulging in stimulating drugs spent many hours, stirring into a tremendous log-fire which had to be specially built up by Oberkellner Fuchs, and the glazing stare into the burning and cracking noise, must have been an inspiration to Hauptman later in the Reichstagsfeuer. Ernst Roehm and Hess had long lasting conferences with the Italian emissaries from the Duce such as Baroness Hartogensis, Count Rocca and the militant Major Gramaccini. Streicher was never a welcome arrival, mainly because of Streicher's public behaviour and Streicher's blunder offending foreign guests as international jewry, which turned out to be influential Greeks, and in any case anti-semitism was at that time only meant to rouse the anger of the riff-raffs on the Street. Hanfstaengel used the hotel besides Hanfstaengel's political intrigues as a hunting ground for Hanfstaengel's homosexual desires. In 1931 The author left the hotel and worked then as a waiter on the “Mitropa” Speisewagen Co. and there again The author had many opportunities to see the new Nazi-Might in the new Nazi-Might's small human weaknesses. But it also gave The author in 1933 the first opportunities to visit places outside Germany. Being able to read newspapers and listen to the radio of a different nature, it made The author more then ever determined to carry on with The author's political belief and activated my political belief in various ways. We often stayed overnight and whilst other members of the crew singled out to other members of the crew's various pleasure haunts, The author spent as much time as possible with some contacts The author made, and taken with The author leaflets and literature which at that time was quite easy to take aboard the train, as the customs control for us was only very - 3 - superficial. Naturally these illegal newspapers and leaflets were greatly appreciated by The author's friends and in small circles in and around Munich. But with the growing demand, also grew the danger and certain negligence on The author's part - it was so easy to outwit the Nazis - must have marked The author as a culprit. Through a friend who was a member of the Nazi-party (NSDAP), member of convenience, and who was told after a drinking session The authorm “Neuaubinger Bierstueberl” that The author's name was mentioned put down for arrest, informed my Father of this. The author immediately left The author's home and went on The author's season ticket to Munich, but changed in Pasing to take train to Augsburg where The author waited next morning for the Munich - Nuremberg-Eger Express train. A collegue on the Speisewagen hid The author in the Storeroom whom The author told The author wanted to visit a girl friend in Eger, but dont want to pay for the Railway fare. Those favours we have done many times to other collegues. Next morning early, the police came to our house and after being told that The author was not at home, were informed that The author should come to the police station immediately after The author's arrival home. As The author have been away from home for professional reasons many times, there was nothing unusual to suspect. Consequently The author had an uneventful journey into Czechoslovakia and exile. Having made a legal entry into Czechoslovakia with German Passport, of course was a disadvantage, as a certain doubt was apparant, but eventually the contacts and the special circumstances cleared the matter. Not able to work and no financial help as yet, made The author's life a grim existence. Somewhere to sleep and some food was all The author could wish for and this was provided by falling ill and being put in a hospital. The author was able to prolong The author's stay there with new illnesses, an - 4 - operation and eventually working in the ward and under Dr. Heller, who was a deciding factor for the release of patients. In April 1934 The author could not stay any longer in the hospital and from then on matters improved considerably. Financial and other assistance, was forthcoming and although the money received paid barely for the room, The author was able sometimes to do some work or help friends and The author had many invitations for dinners etc. The author also succeeded in holding a job for about six months, until the Czech authorities clamped down. Similar cases were quite severely dealt with, but The author got away with a warning mostly due to the intervention of some party officials. Contacts had to be established again, and a visitor from Germany set the matter again in motion. The author had to undertake a trip into Germany too see two people from Munich and The author made a further crossing into Germany in Bayrisch Eisenstein to guide a valuable contact across to Czechoslovakia. This also meant a reconaisance for further activities along this border. About this time a man contacted The author, named George Huber from a place called Starnberg near Munich. a man was a kitchen assistant in a “Mitropa” Dinning Car, and a man called at the Volkshaus in Eger to make The author's aquaintance. As The author was away in Karlsbad for a day, a man was asked to call again on a man's next trip. On a man's second call although The author was present in the Volkshaus in Eger The author did not introduce The author but left the talking to some S.P.D. He members the SPD party-members. After a man's third call, we got together and some of a man's explanations - where a man comes from, what a man was doing, and that a man was thrown out of the Nazi-party (NSDAP) - seemed to be alright. It was decided to give a man a chance to proof a man and a man was entrusted with some minor - 5 - activities, all carried out to the letter, and accepted to Munich. This went on for nearly nine months and during the Winter months Munich paid a man's expenses to make a trip to Eger, because the seasonal run by the Mitropa was ended. In the meantime The author's mother came to visit The author, upon my mother's return my mother was questioned by the Police and the exitement was to much for my mother, my mother died two days afterwards. It was urged by Munich to arrange a meeting of various underground workers from Munich to meet with the political leaders in the emigration, and it was suggested that a conference should be held in Neuern about 12 miles inside Czechoslovakia. Prior to this meeting, a man was introduced to a captain of the Czech intelligence, partly to get a final scrutiny, and also the aspect of reporting activities of certain Sudeten Germans who left CSR because of unlawful behaviour, as members of the Nazi-party (NSDAP). a man was finally cleared and practically lost to our cause, because a man worked mainly for a captain of the Czech intelligence. It was hoped that four men from Munich would take part in the Neuern conference. Eventually we were informed that three would come, of which two where personally known to us. It was also decided that The author should proceed to Zelezna Ruda the nameuch for the Czech side of Munich. The author got out of the train and walked to the Station on the border which took The author about 15 Minutes. Whilst The author was waiting on the outside of the Station on the border which took me about 15 Minutes - the station entrance was divided into half by wooden posts about 3 ft high, right across the street - The author noticed some activities of civilian and uniformed SS men in the distance, but saw nothing unusual in civilian and uniformed SS men's presence. - 6 - The author's plan was to mingle with the crowd from the train, on Saturdays rather heavy and let the contact men follow The author into the village of Bayrisch Eisenstein and enter CSR on a pathway as previously done. Eventually the train arrived late, but it made we wonder why no passengers came through the station exit. The author was just going to visit a station buffet a few yards further inside CSR when The author saw suddenly 3 hefty men rushing out of CSR and grabbing The author about 12 ft inside Czechoslovakian soil. 3 hefty men immediately set upon The author with knuckeldusters and rubber truncheons, and an uniformed frontier policist rushed out and set an uniformed frontier policist's rifle butts in The author's rips. Gradually 3 hefty men dragged The author nearer the border posts and The author clung on to one with all The author's strength left in The author. A Czech policeman intervened but A Czech policeman was also knocked down (this made it an international dispute) and a last final robust effort brought The author's collapse and The author was dragged along the road to conclude the Menschenraub. Months later The author realised that this was The author's luckiest day The author could wish for. the Nazi-party (NSDAP) bungled the job thoroughly. All the Nazi-party (NSDAP) had to do, let the people and the contact out and The author would have been on German soil, where the Nazi-party (NSDAP) could have arrested The author without any international complications. From eyewitness reports: the Nazi-party (NSDAP) eventually carried The author down the road to the village and outside a butchers shop the Nazi-party (NSDAP) revived The author with buckets of water, handcuffed The author, and set again upon The author with the Nazi-party (NSDAP)'s fists. After knocking The author out a few times, always the water treatment was applied. A woman bystander begged the Nazi-party (NSDAP) to stop, but the Nazi-party (NSDAP)'s reply was its not A woman bystander's business and A woman bystander should move quickly, otherwise A woman bystander could keep The author company. the Nazi-party (NSDAP) left The author laying on the ground for a time, when a police car arrived to pick The author up and The author was moved to the police station in Eisenstein. - 7 - Now the Nazi-party (NSDAP) handcuffed The author's hands on the back, and the two guards now in charge of the room took an occasional backhand swipe at The author, because the two guards now in charge of the room had to be on duty, instead of enjoying some festival in the next town. The author's face was terrible swollen, The author's eyes practically closed with swelling and blood, The author's nose brocken and loose skin hang down from The author's lips. Two men originally involved in the Menschenraub, came back and The author gathered that the way the Nazi-party (NSDAP) arrested The author, was not very favourably received by Gestapo headquarters in Munich. This was quite obvious as Gestapo headquarters in Munich blamed The author's resistance for the attention this arrest has caused. Now Gestapo headquarters in Munich started to their questioning The author, and The author had great difficulty in answering even the most harmless question such as name, age, etc, because The author's mouth and tongue was so badly swollen and The author had the feeling of chocking The author. Unable to make sensible words, was taken as a further resistance to Gestapo headquarters in Munich's questioning and further blows followed each time. On three more occasions The author had to be revived the last time The author came too, The author found The author in a lavatory on the floor, The author's head hanging into the pan soaking wet. Back The author was taken to the room, and a village policeman came in with a bottle of Iodine in a village policeman's hand, very likely to patch The author's face up a little. This was resented by the the Nazi-party (NSDAP) men and one of the Gestapo men knocked a bottle of Iodine in his hand out of his hand, which landed in The author's face, and the iodine run down The author's badly mauled face, giving agonising pain. The author's hands were cuffed on the back and The author had a tremendous urge to touch The author's face, The author shrieked up and thrown The author forward into the stomach of one of the Gestapo men, he must have sought The author went berserk and he delivered a blow at The author's neck which must have made The author unconscious for many hours. After The author came too, The author noticed it was already dark and we were in a car. Soon after moving away from Munich The author was alternatively given - 8 - heavy blows by the Gestapo men and Zelezna Ruda the nameuch for the Czech side of Eisenstein and only after Zelezna Ruda the nameuch for the Czech side of Eisenstein run nearly of the road, was Zelezna Ruda the nameuch for the Czech side of Eisenstein told to concentrate on driving, and leave the softening up to the Gestapo men. the Gestapo men's blows were mingled with questions, which The author mostly ignored, mostly due to The author's condition, and also due to despair of the hopeless situation The author put The author into. As the Gestapo men got no further, the Gestapo men stopped a car in a lonely place, dragged The author along the field to a tree and put the rope round The author and tied The author's head to a tree. From a car was a beam of light - a movable car lamp very likely - directed at The author and as The author didnt answer any questions for above mentioned reasons the Gestapo men threaten The author to shoot The author down. As The author still kept silence the Gestapo men shot at The author, but very wide, quiete obviously to frighten The author. If the Gestapo men would have only known how The author welcomed a bullet at that time to end it all. Still without food or water, The author's condition was very poor indeed. And the Gestapo men must have realised that, because as we were nearing Munich, the Gestapo men stopped a car again, near a little river, one man took a car rag dipped a car rag into the water and rubbed The author's face down. Never has water tasted so good, even if it was only a few drops The author sucked into The author's mouth from a car rag. the Gestapo men also washed some of the blood away from The author's clothing. This early morning wash brought some sense back in The author, and The author realised that if The author ever get a break The author must concentrate on some kind of defence. Luckily the Gestapo men fallen asleep and The author had some rest and peace to think. At 5 am, the Gestapo men arrived in Munich and The author was taken to the Wittelsbacher Palais, which was the headquarters of the Nazi-party (NSDAP). - 9 - A guard of SS men were waiting for the Gestapo men's arrival. As The author was helped out of the train a sudden black out occured and after turning round The author must have fallen with The author's face into the gravel path. Immediately A guard of SS men set upon The author again, kicking The author with the Guards's heavy boots, but this time, the two men who originally attacked The author, came to The author's help, by holding the Guards back. the Guards must have realised that with The author's hands tight on the back The author was just not able to get up, and also the Guards may have had a little remorse what the Guards done to The author. After all, the Guards were very likely heading for some trouble, for bungling the Guards's job. The author was lifted up from the ground and marched along with the two men assisting The author climbing the stairs to the first floor, where the main interrogation room was situated. Two different men appeared on the scene and one of Two different men took off The author's handcuffs, so The author could obey and undress. The author's arms were completely numb and The author was unable to lift The author's arm to unbutton The author's waistcoat - the jacket was ripped to pieces anyway. This was taken as a refusal to co-operate and The author received two more blows, deep with rage The author kicked out against the man, and strangely enough the man held the man back from throwing the man on The author in a rage of fury, told The author to sit down. Took the man on the man's arm and pushed the man out of the room. Both disappeared, and only the man who unexpectedly showed some kindness came back and helped The author to undress and completed the thorough search. The author was standing naked for about 15 Minutes and was shivering from cold. The author was told again to dress and after a few preliminaris The author was taken in a car to the police headquarters. By the time a further search was made, and a cell allocated and taken there, it was about 7 a.m. - 10 - The author was terribly tired, but sleep did not come, so The author kept thinking along the line of The author's defence. It was now Sunday midday and The author was given for the first time some food, having nothing to eat since early Saturday morning. some food, having nothing to eat since early Saturday morning The author vomitted and the warder brought a bucket and water to clean up. The strohbett was chained up and one had to stand up or seat on a small stool in a very small cell. But the whole of Sunday there was no interruption for questioning and also next day Monday was free. This was a lucky break, because The author used every minute of it, working out The author's statement and kept on repeating my statement, hour for hour. Had they kept on beating The author and asking questions The author might quiete easily have brocken down and compromised The author all the way. Certain matters puzzled The author all along and The author had a feeling that either G. Huber or Zelezna Ruda the nameuch for the Czech side of Eisenstein must have played a double game. If it was Zelezna Ruda the nameuch for the Czech side of Eisenstein, The author's position might not be completely lost if The author played my position right, if it was G. Huber or both, then that was the end, whatever The author try to say or do. On Tuesday morning the interrogation started early. The author was taken again under guard to the Wittelsbacher Palais and police Commisar Schmidt started the questions. (The author's two days respite were due to the fact that police Commisar Schmidt was called to Munich to explain the circumstances of The author's arrest on Czecholsovakian soil.) The author declared that The author's going to CSR was actuated by The author's desire to visit a girl in Eger, who The author got to know during The author's employment with the Mitropa. For months The author was ill in hospital and only, long after The author's release, did The author make contact with some politcal persons opposed to the III. Reich. This gradually developed into some leaflet smuggling and talking to people coming from Germany, or having some connection there. The whole activities could be described as - 11 - high spirited and had no basic organisation behind The whole activities. (This was true as the Nazi-party (NSDAP), had kept the Nazi-party (NSDAP)'s organisation aloft from the activities of the emigrants.) There were however funds available to assist persons like The author, and The author had to have some assistance to secure some kind of living. The author laid the blame on a Czech captain who tried to engage The author in a Czech captain who tried to engage me in his activities's activities, but a man dealt with this part and The author had nothing to do with this part. (By this time it was clear that a man was an agent provocateur, as The author have seen on the large files some reports handwritten in a man name. And if a man was in it too, then the Gestapo men will be blamed to the full.) the interrogations went on day by day and were always in the presence of police Commisar Schmidt and a woman secretary called Fratz. police Commisar Schmidt has done no physical harm to The author, and actually apologised for the behaviour of the men in the village of Bayrisch Eisenstein, but saying that because of The author's resistance the men in Eisenstein lost the men in Eisenstein's temper and The author have injured one man by biting one man on one man's arm. police Commisar Schmidt also told The author that a certain interest has been aroused in the world press over this kiddnapping and terrible lies are spread in the newspapers, also stating that The author have already been killed by the Nazi-party (NSDAP). This The author poohood and asked whether The author could see it. police Commisar Schmidt promised to do so later, but at the moment police Commisar Schmidt has a proposition to make to The author. To counteract this kiddnapping and terrible lies are spread in the newspapers” The author should make a statement over the radio, silencing once and for all these allegations. The author talked to police Commisar Schmidt about the merit of such a statement, which would of course proof that The author am still alive, but nothing more. On The author's further request police Commisar Schmidt showed The author the “Prager Tageblatt”, which police Commisar Schmidt described as a “jewish lavatory paper” but only the headlines and nothing about The author's departure from the living. The author certainly realised that The author's position is not as hopeless as my position looks and The author taken courage from - 12 - this revelation. The statement The author should have given personally over the radio was approximately as follows: “To counteract the impact of the wild propaganda against the III. Reich The author am perfectly willing to state, that The author's treatment is more than good, that no further physical violence has taken place after the first few minutes of The author's arrest, and only because The author offered strong resistance and by doing so injured one of the member of the state police, doing the member of the state police's duty. That The author have seen the folly of The author's actions, fully regretting my actions, and make good the terrible harm The author have done Czechoslovakia. The author am fully aware that The author's actions demand severe punishment, but by mending The author's ways and condemning the work of the traitors in Prague The author shall after a time be allowed to join the Gemeinschaft of the Third Reich.” The author refused blantly to sign this statement, and although a certain pressure was put to The author, threats of resumption of violence, arrest of The author's relations, and bread and water for 24 hours, every other day, threats of resumption of violence, arrest of my relations, and bread and water for 24 hours faded away, and nothing was mentioned anymore. The author was allowed to spend some of the money The author had on The author, and the state police gave The author the standard course operating on that day for Czech currency. This enabled The author to buy modestly cigarettes, twice some chocolates and some fruit. The author's only exercise was The author's interrogation transport to and from the Wittelsbacher Palais, always with guards and some superior. On one afternoon, The author was left for a few minutes alone in the room, and Fraulein Fratz the secretary who had taken down everything first in short hand and then typed in The author's presence word for word what was said - 13 - told The author quite openly that The author am going to be sent back to Czechoslovakia. The author was so taken aback that The author nearly fainted, and Fraulein Fratz the secretary who had taken down everything first in short hand and then typed in my presence word for word what was said - 13 - assured The author that it is true. Fraulein Fratz the secretary who had taken down everything first in short hand and then typed in my presence word for word what was said - 13 - seemed frank and honest enough and The author always had a feeling that Fraulein Fratz the secretary who had taken down everything first in short hand and then typed in my presence word for word what was said - 13 - had a sense of shame and disgust for the way The author was treated. Fraulein Fratz the secretary who had taken down everything first in short hand and then typed in my presence word for word what was said - 13 -'s soft voice never faltered and there was definitely some sympathy for The author and the plight The author was in. The author had a feeling that the Nazi-party (NSDAP) will try anything to make The author stay or make it impossible for The author to be delivered back to CSR. For a further interrogation, which now lasted only a few hours or less, The author had to walk with a civilian. a civilian stopped looking into windows, sat down on a bench opposite the famous Regina Palast Hotel, and made it pretty obvious that the Nazi-party (NSDAP)'s are plenty of chances to escape. What a civilian did not realise, that The author sensed being followed by armed guards and armed guards just waited for The author to make a false move, had The author tried anything armed guards would have shot The author dead, having a perfect excuse, being a man in custody trying to escape. And The author wonder even to-day whether a civilian knew of such a plan, and by tell uing The author of the intended release, gave The author a warning not to do any foolish things. The time of return came nearer and efforts were made to make The author give another statement over the radio, this time being informed of the circumstances, The author should have declared that The author prefer to stay in Germany. They allowed The author a privilege of the visit of Liesel Goessl, which The author's parents had taken into the family as my parents's sister. Liesel Goessl, which my parents had taken into the family as our sister was asked to bring fresh clothing and some soap, until then The author had to go without. When Liesel Goessl, which my parents had taken into the family as our sister saw The author Liesel Goessl, which my parents had taken into the family as our sister fell round The author's neck and whispered quickly that Papa has also been arrested. Go back. police Commisar Schmidt's effort to bring The author's sister here and my sister should talk The author into staying in Germany was not successful, as Liesel Goessl, which my parents had taken into the family as our sister either by design - 14 - or otherwise kept on crying and Liesel Goessl, which my parents had taken into the family as our sister was led away. The author asked why The author cannot see The author's father and told them that this leaves some measure of doubt regarding his father's's well being. But it was refused, because according to the Rule no person who may be in any way connected with a prisoners activity was allowed to have a conversation. This of course was enough to convince The author that The author's father is under arrest. The author was told to allow a man to shave The author, had a bath - the first since imprisonement, and The author's suit was mended and somehow cleaned, put into a larger friendly cell, with a little table and a stool inside, some American cloth on the table and a flower vase, but empty. a larger friendly cell, with a little table and a stool inside, some American cloth on the table and a flower vase did not have the usual ghastly sanitary arrangements, and one had to call for a warden to be led to the toilet. The author was then informed that The author should ask for the Czech Consul to see The author, to make a declaration in front of the Czech Consul, that The author shall stay in Germany. Again The author refused and pointed out, that police Commisar Schmidt is so eager to clear the charges made against the III. Reich, and this way, even more suspicion is thrown against them, because the people abroad do not belief such voluntary statements are given without pressure. Not to jeopardise The author's chances of safety, The author said that The author really think the best thing is to get the matter over, and The author am prepared to return to Germany within three days of The author's deliverance. This will give The author time to clear up certain things, and it will also prove to the world that the III. Reich is law-abiding. To a certain extent The author think The author succeeded in The author's story, may be too, because the Nazi-party (NSDAP) had no other way out anyway. The day of The author's return trip arrived, after a long wait, in the morning, The author was put into a high powered Mercedes, and the people with The ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

91,"['Mrs Sternberg-Sitte is a Christian and emigrated to Amsterdam in 1933 with Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin. The Nuremberg laws prohibited a legal marriage. At first the couple lived precariously, Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin as a taxi-driver, Mrs Sternberg-Sitte as a dressmaker. Later, Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin had an agency for groceries. After the German invasion, Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin ostensibly left the couple's flat and lived illegally as an “onderduiker”. In September 1942 the couple were denounced and arrested and taken to the Amsteveensche Weg prison. Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin was sent to Amersfort camp and later gassed in Auschwitz (p.2). Mrs Sternberg-Sitte remained in prison until 1943. Conditions there were tolerable, although the cells were badly overcrowded. Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was then put on a transport of prisoners which stopped at the prisons of Scheveningen, Cleve, Utrecht, Düsseldorf, Hannover and Berlin, collecting prisoners of all types and nationalities, finally to end in Ravensbrück. There were approximately 50,000 prisoners in Ravensbrück, both political and criminal. The account goes into the details of the appalling conditions there, describing the organisation in the various blocks (p.4), the insufficient food and clothing (p.5), the brutal treatment under the command of supervisor Binz ( p.5) and the atrocities and penalties for the least lapse (p.5-7). There were three brothels in the camp (p.7-8) whose inmates had preferential treatment, but if they became ill they were gassed. Pregnant women had to submit to abortions, and if a child was born, the prisoners killed a child and considered this an act of humanity. Of two smaller camps nearby, one was turned into an extermination camp, and of the 4,000 women sent there only 30 survived (p.8). the 4,000 women sent there were allocated to various “commandos“ and Mrs Sternberg-Sitte got into the group working for Siemens. This entailed various privileges e.g. an extra ration of bread - “Siemensbrot”- and housing in special blocks (p.7). In March 1945 Siemens no longer had work for the 4,000 women sent there, and the 4,000 women sent there returned to the general camp. In April 1945 the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg prisoners had to report to the “Volkssturm”, the SS having disappeared, and were told by some Swedes arriving at the general camp that the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg prisoners were free. When lorries arrived to fetch the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg prisoners, lorries took other prisoners as well, and Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was one of other prisoners. They were first taken to the International Red Cross centre in Lübeck and from there on a hazardous journey (p.10) with frequent air attacks and breakdowns via Bremen, Kiel and Hamburg to Flensburg, and after a short stop at the Danish frontier town of Padborg they went to Malmö in Sweden. From here Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was later repatriated to Holland. 9. Further references : De Miranda Wethouder, Amsterdam, murdered in Amersfoort (p.2).

Killing of Newborn Babies as an Act of Humanity As a Jewish lawyer, Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin was persecuted in Berlin as early as in 1933, so Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin decided to emigrate to Amsterdam with Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin's girlfriend at the time – a non-Jew called Hilde Sitte. In 1935, Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin expressed Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin's desire to marry Hilde Sitte in the Netherlands. However, as this was prohibited under German law, the option of marriage was not open to Mr S. and Mrs Sternberg-Sitte. After the war, though, this intended marriage to Hilde Sitte was recognised in both Germany and the Netherlands. When Mr S. and Mrs Sternberg-Sitte arrived in Amsterdam in 1933, the conditions were extremely tough. If you wanted to work, you needed a permit that was not easy to get hold of. Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin's first wife, who was also living in Amsterdam, received support from the Jewish Comité. support was not, however, made available to Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin and Mrs Sternberg-Sitte on the basis that Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was a Christian. The Dutch people helped out wherever The Dutch people possibly could. As Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin had gone over to the Netherlands in a car, Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin managed to earn money as a taxi driver, whilst Hilde Sitte took on sewing work. In 1938, Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin started to import sausages and other meat products and lived off the proceeds made by selling sausages and other meat products. When the war broke out, Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin carried on selling food but narrowed down Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin's business to domestic Dutch offerings. In 1940, Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin moved out of Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin's apartment and, as far as the legal proceedings were concerned, purchased another one. his apartment was transferred over to Hilde Sitte's name and Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin lived with Hilde Sitte ‘in hiding’. As of October 1941, these living arrangements became too dangerous and Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin had a string of several ‘in hiding’ addresses. - 2 - In February 1942, a huge number of young Jews were arrested and deported to Mauthausen concentration camp. It was very rare for anyone to return home from Mauthausen concentration camp. At the end of August 1942, Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin ran out of ‘hiding places’ and so Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin returned home to Hilde Sitte apartment. But someone betrayed Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin's trust and revealed Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin's location. Eight days later, they were both arrested by the Dutch, who were accompanied by the German Gestapo. On 2 September, they were taken to the Amstelveensche Weg Prison, where they were separated. Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin was kept there until 23 October 1942, when Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin was ‘transported’ to Mauthausen concentration camp. Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin was joined by Deputy Mayor and City Councillor De Miranda Wethouder from Amsterdam. The conditions in the general camp were horrifying and Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin was beaten to death. The prisoners were starving hungry and thirsty and The prisoners were made to stand for roll calls day and night. Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin was known as ‘The Amersfoort Executioner’. After somewhere between eight and ten days in Amersfoort, Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin was sent to Westerbork, where Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin remained until around 10 November. Mr Sternberg-Sitte, a Jewish lawyer from Berlin then ended up in Auschwitz and was gassed there on 13 November. Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was kept in the prison until the middle of January 1943. What little food they were given was disgusting, but they were not beaten and were allowed half an hour of fresh air every day, for ‘airing’ as it was called in the prison. They were allowed a bath every fortnight but the cells that were designed to accommodate a single occupant were each crammed with four or five political prisoners. If the prisoners happened to be Jews, there would be eight of the prisoners to a cell. In mid-January, Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was told Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was due to go on the ‘transport’, but Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was not given any information about where Mrs Sternberg-Sitte would be going. Mrs Sternberg-Sitte's next destination turned out to be the ‘Oranjehotel’ prison in Scheveningen. After one or two nights, Mr S. and Mrs Sternberg-Sitte had collected a number of prisoners, who were then sent to the prison in Cleve, after first - 3 - spending a night at the prison in Utrecht. Not far from the prison in Cleve was a meat processing plant, where dried vegetables were also produced. The prisoners were made to cut up turnips for a meat processing plant, where dried vegetables were also produced. After between eight and ten days, The prisoners were put onto the ‘transport. At the train station, German civilians spat at The prisoners, whilst the Dutch tried the Dutch's best to offer The prisoners words of encouragement. The train that took The prisoners out of Cleve had barred cells instead of compartments. Even though each cell was clearly meant for one individual, five people were shoved into each one. The prisoners's first stop was for one night at the Düsseldorf Prison and The prisoners spent the following night at the Hanover Prison. At each location, The prisoners picked up more and more people. From Amersfoort, The prisoners made The prisoners's way to Berlin. When The prisoners arrived there, The prisoners were taken to the Police Headquarters at Alexanderplatz. At the Hanover Prison, The prisoners were housed in huge halls and everything was infested with bugs and fleas. It was at this point that the first Poles and Russians joined The prisoners on The prisoners's transport. The prisoners stayed there for one day and one night, before being moved on to Ravensbrück. The population of prisoners held at Amersfort camp included German political prisoners and criminals alongside international representatives from Poland, Russia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Turkey, Denmark, France, Belgium, China, England and the Netherlands. As a rough estimate, there were around 50,000 prisoners in total. Upon arrival, they had to hand over everything in their possession and line up naked for bathing. After a cold shower, they were provided with prisoner outfits made up of trousers, shirts, socks, slippers, dresses and jackets. They were then ushered into the barracks, where they were assigned one bed between two people. They were not required to work when they were staying in the admission block. - 4 - the admission block was divided up into two rooms – one of which was initially used for sleeping and the other for eating. One of the prisoners (all of whom were female) was given the role of ‘block leader’ and One of the prisoners (all of whom were female) reported to the SS warden. The main requirement was to obey all orders to the letter. The block elder had a room elder under The block elder. After 14 days, The prisoners were assigned to different blocks and The prisoners were required to work from that point onwards. There were a range of different labour assignments, including at the Siemens industrial site, where uniforms and coats were made and repaired for soldiers. There was also outdoor labour, such as in production. Even jobs including stonework, building roads and barracks and servicing boilers had to be done by women. Mrs Sternberg-Sitte worked for Siemens, which was the best option of all the jobs available. Siemens had Siemens's own professional German management team, meaning that Mrs Sternberg-Sitte wasn’t a prisoner Mrs Sternberg-Sitte. The working hours were between 7am and 6pm, with three quarters of an hour for lunch. The prisoners were woken up at 4.30am. Whatever the weather, The prisoners were required to stand for roll call from 5.15am to 6.45am. Then, once The prisoners returned from work, there was another roll call, but another roll call was later abolished. The prisoners would sometimes be summoned for a roll call at 2am – those were the absolute worst ones. The prisoners's camp warden was a young woman aged around 23 or 24 – a supervisor who went by the name of Mrs Sternberg-Sitte. a young woman aged around 23 or 24 – a supervisor who went by the name of Ms Binz wore a uniform and all of the women were afraid of a young woman aged around 23 or 24 – a supervisor who went by the name of Ms Binz. a young woman aged around 23 or 24 – a supervisor who went by the name of Ms Binz would hit all of the women on the head with a young woman aged around 23 or 24 – a supervisor who went by the name of Ms Binz's massive roll call book, kick all of the women to death and lead all of the women to all of the women's work, accompanied by guard dogs. After the war had ended, a young woman aged around 23 or 24 – a supervisor who went by the name of Ms Binz was hung by the Russians. a young woman aged around 23 or 24 – a supervisor who went by the name of Ms Binz and the other wardens would beat all of the women for no reason at all. If women dropped down dead at roll call, She and the other wardens would beat women again just to make sure - 5 - that She and the other wardens's victims were well and truly dead. Tall flames could always be seen burning in the crematorium that was operating throughout the day and night. all of the women would have to go past the crematorium that was operating throughout the day and night to get to work. The prisoners were never sufficiently clothed and were basically just walking around in rags. Everything was infested with lice and the toilets didn’t work, so everyone was wading around in mud and excrement that came up to their knees. The barracks didn’t have any window panes and there often wasn’t a water supply. Even when there was water, water was undrinkable. Despite the warning not to drink water, lots of people tried to use water to quench lots of people's desperate thirst. These foul conditions meant that diseases such as cholera, plague and typhus were rife. The food provisions were as follows: In the morning, the prisoners were given coffee, which tasted like brown water without any form of sweetener. Lunch consisted of a thick stew, which was more often than not made of dried vegetables. Then, the evening meal was soup or cabbage with potato peelings, served with a piece of bread. Anyone that worked at Siemens was given an extra bit of bread, which came to be known as ‘Siemens bread’. As time went on, the food got scarcer and scarcer. If a prisoner was ever found to have a cigarette, a prisoner would have all a prisoner's hair shaved off and a prisoner's front teeth knocked out. a prisoner would then be transferred to the punishment camp, which was located behind an extra layer of barbed wire. The prisoners’ morale was at rock bottom. It was every individual for The prisoners’ and stealing from each other was part of the way of life. - 6 - After around three or four weeks, Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was moved to the ‘VIP block’. It was only possible to make it to the ‘VIP block’ if you had the right ‘connections’. Only the block elder had the power to choose who made it and who didn’t. The inhabitants of the ‘VIP block’ included people from the kitchen, the uniform store and the office. The more intellectual people would be accepted, whilst the social misfits and working class prisoners were not welcome. Beds only had to be shared by two prisoners and the food was better given that kitchen staff stayed there and could pull some strings. Thanks to the women from the uniform store, the prisoners here even had better quality clothing to put on. Even then, though, what the prisoners here wore was still marked up on the back. The block elder was a prisoner too and The block elder tried The block elder's best to do all The block elder could for The block elder's people. When it was possible, The block elder made sure that punishments were either not issued at all or were at least reduced. Pregnant women were stopped from giving birth if at all possible. Abortions were instead performed, but the majority of women didn’t survive Abortions. If a child was born, the other prisoners would pick a child up by the feet and beat a child to death. This was an act of humanity given that if a child had been allowed to live, the camp supervisors would have systematically starved both mother and child. Some of the prisoners received packages. The Norwegians received Some of the prisoners from the Red Cross, whilst the Poles and Czechs were allowed to receive gifts from home. The Germans didn’t receive many packages at all given that there wasn’t much left in the Netherlands anyway. Virtually nothing ever came through for the Dutch. Between one and three barracks were kept separate and prepared ready for any visitors that might show up for an inspection. Himmler was among any visitors that might show up for an inspection, but an inspection stopped taking place from 1944 onwards. - 7 - Some time around October or November 1944, Siemens built four or five blocks for Siemens's workers in their workers in their own area's own area, as it had practical advantages for their workers in their own area. Some 2000 women were moved into these blocks, which were all divided up by nationality with the exception of This one remaining block. This one remaining block was another that housed ‘VIPs’, with a mix of nationalities. These inhabitants again included kitchen, office and uniform staff. Even though Mrs Sternberg-Sitte worked at a machine, Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was once again lucky enough to be given a spot in the ‘VIP block’. Bathing was technically never allowed but because they had a bathing attendant among them, they had the opportunity to take a shower every evening for six months. Any incidents at all that didn’t suit Siemens – no matter what Any incidents at all that didn’t suit Siemens – no matter what they were – were – were reported to the commandant’s office as sabotage. A variety of punishments were dished out for such incidents. People were stripped down to the shirt on People's back, before having cold water poured over People and being forced to stand out in the cold. Alternatively, People might be locked in the bunker. In some cases, People would be left there for three days and nights without any food or drink, standing in ice-cold water up to knee height. One Dutch lady survived 14 days in these conditions, with a little food being given to One Dutch lady every three days. One Dutch lady's case was disclosed during the Nuremberg Trials – One Dutch lady's name was Neeltje Epker and she came from The Hague. Other prisoners were punished by being beaten with an iron club – 50 times! What usually happened was that the kidneys or other organs would come out and the women would die. Amersfort camp was home to the most primitive of people. For example, there were German farmers’ wives who had had a relationship with a farmhand whilst German farmers’ wives who had had a relationship with a farmhand whilst their husbands were at war's husbands were at war. When German farmers’ wives who had had a relationship with a farmhand whilst their husbands were at war were sent to Amersfort camp, German farmers’ wives who had had a relationship with a farmhand whilst their husbands were at war were in a broken state, having been arrested for anti-social behaviour. Amersfort camp also had three different brothels: a soldiers’ brothel, an SS brothel and a prisoners’ brothel. Anyone who wanted to could get involved. The brothel prisoners were allowed to wear jewellery, get a perm and so on. - 8 - The director of the industrial site was one SS Officer Binder. If a prisoner didn’t keep up with a prisoner's workload, one SS Officer Binder would kill a prisoner while a prisoner were still behind a prisoner's machine. Mrs Sternberg-Sitte became an eyewitness to this. In October 1944, the prisoners at Ravensbrück were made to build gas chambers. Once they were done, the prisoners at Ravensbrück were shot so the prisoners at Ravensbrück weren’t able to tell anyone else about what the prisoners at Ravensbrück had been doing. Transports were sent from Ravensbrück and other concentration camps, supposedly to take care of cleaning-up work. In reality, the prisoners on Transports were being sent to be gassed. If any of the women working in a prisoners’ brothel got sick, any of the women working in the brothel too would end up in gas chambers. There were two small camps not far at all from Ravensbrück – a men’s camp and a youth camp. Young Germans who had committed crimes, such as theft, but were not yet older than 17 years old were sent to a men’s camp. At the end of 1944, the prisoners in a men’s camp were either released in the less serious cases or Young Germans who had committed crimes, such as theft, but were not yet older than 17 years old were transferred to a men’s camp. What had once been a men’s camp was then turned into an extermination camp. Around 4000 women were sent to a men’s camp, including those who were no longer able to work or those who were disabled. Around 4000 women were promised that Around 4000 women would not be required to perform any more work once Around 4000 women arrived there. In a men’s camp, Around 4000 women had still had one oven, but there wasn’t one at a youth camp. The prisoners there were only given food every three days. In the middle of January, the prisoners had the prisoners's blankets and coats taken away from the prisoners. The result of all of this was that the prisoners became weaker and sicker. Once the prisoners were well and truly ill, the prisoners were this process to the gas chambers. Upon the realisation that this process wasn’t moving quickly enough, 25 people were picked every day to be sent to the gas chambers. Around 4000 women were gassed between January and the middle of March, with only 30 of Around 4000 women surviving. Every day, the corpses were piled up in the wash rooms at the large camp, - 9 - where the corpses stayed until a vehicle was sent to pick the corpses up. the corpses were then chucked onto a vehicle and taken to crematoria to be burnt. The other prisoners would steal anything left on the dead bodies. In March 1945, a freight train arrived from Auschwitz. a freight train was loaded up with urns full of ashes, which were all labelled up with dates. urns full of ashes, which were all labelled up with dates were thrown into the Fürstenberg Lake. By the end of March 1945, Siemens had run out of tasks for Siemens's workers to complete, so the prisoners were sent back to the Hanover Prison. Even in those last Siemens days, the prisoners heard rumours about an ‘exchange’. One day, the Norwegians and Danes were called for and taken away on nice coaches adorned with the Danish flag. Once the prisoners had arrived back at a men’s camp, the French were transferred onto transports with German soldiers. On 23 April, all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners were made to line up. all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners were terrified of the prospect of being transferred somewhere else on foot, but this did nothing to help all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners. all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners were forced to assemble and then recorded in writing. all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners were allowed to remove all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners's numbers and badges that labelled all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners as criminals. all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners set off on a long march that led all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners to a men’s camp. all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners were pushed into the barracks by ‘Volkssturm’ officers. the German Gestapo were nowhere to be seen. The next morning, without being given anything to eat, all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners had to embark upon another march. This time, all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners ended up back in a men’s camp. all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners were made to stand there until 7pm that evening. The head of the preventive detention camp and Mrs Sternberg-Sitte stood with all of the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourgish prisoners. At 7pm that evening, a private car with a Swedish flag on a private car with a Swedish flag on it arrived. A doctor and three Swedes in uniforms got out of a private car with a Swedish flag on it and went to the commandant’s's office. When A doctor and three Swedes in uniforms came out again, three Swedes in uniforms addressed the prisoners: ‘three Swedes in uniforms's dear ladies, the prisoners are free! the prisoners are coming with A doctor and three Swedes in uniforms - 10 - to Holland.’ One last time, Mrs Sternberg-Sitte kicked the sick people who were lying around on the floor. three Swedes in uniforms spotted Mrs Sternberg-Sitte doing this. Every prisoner was given a International Red Cross package. three Swedes in uniforms were able to take more women with three Swedes in uniforms than three Swedes in uniforms had originally expected would be possible. three Swedes in uniforms promised that three Swedes in uniforms would send cars to pick the sick people who were lying around on the floor up. Simple International Red Cross trucks appeared, chauffeured by black Canadian drivers. They were all gathered together at a central International Red Cross centre in Lübeck. Owing to the fact that a central International Red Cross centre in Lübeck was based there, Lübeck hadn’t been under fire since 1943. The journey to Lübeck took them through Schwerin and the vehicles were so overcrowded that they had to stand up inside the vehicles. They went on via Bremen and Kiel, facing major challenges along the way. They found themselves on the front line and the air raids were constant. They were divided into three groups by German cars and attacked by low-flying aircraft near Hamburg. The Americans shot at them and 40 of the people on the transport were killed and 80 seriously injured. On the very next day, there was yet another air raid. The buses were destroyed and they had to wait for new ones to arrive. The replacement buses were equipped with the Danish flag and this time the drivers were Swedish, Norwegian and Danish. The buses were shot at again. One of the drivers always stood on the mudguard, whilst another stood on the vehicle at the back. During attacks by low-flying aircraft, the 4,000 women sent there were allowed to hide in the woods. the 4,000 women sent there were getting on and off The buses constantly. There were around 30 Polish Jewish women on the first bus, which was completely burnt out, meaning they had to be loaded onto different buses. They didn’t get any proper food until they reached Lübeck. When they were in the vicinity of Kiel, one bus that had two sick people on board, got a puncture. The bus Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was on was too full. Once the vehicle carrying two sick people had been repaired, ten people from one bus that had two sick people on board were moved over to the vehicle carrying the seriously injured. Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was among those transferred, meaning that - 11 - Mrs Sternberg-Sitte was one of the first to arrive in Lübeck. The remaining buses had further attacks to withstand yet. Once The prisoners arrived in Padborn, a city on the Danish border, The prisoners were put up in stables. But this accommodation made for a welcome change. The prisoners's beds were made up of clean straw piled high; The prisoners were given woollen blankets and fed white bread and milk. The prisoners continued The prisoners's journey to Holland via Hamburg, travelling to Holland on trains via ferries. The prisoners were surrounded by minelayers on all sides. Even the sick and dead were transported too, with the utmost care being taken. The prisoners finally reached The prisoners's destination after what had been a long journey. Once The prisoners made it to Malmo, The prisoners were safe. From there, The prisoners were later repatriated to the Netherlands.

92,"['F. was only a schoolgirl when ['F.'s family made an unsuccessful attempt at emigrating from Frankfurt to France and at settling in Paris. her family returned to Berlin in 1935, whereupon the father was taken to Dachau and the mother to Moringen-Soling camp. ['F. found a home with an aunt in Mecklenburg, and after 9 months ['F. met ['F.'s parents at the Czechoslovak frontier, sadly changed by the suffering in the camps. her family reached Prague, and the Refugee Committee helped her family until the father found employment in the father's profession as a chemist. ['F. became a pupil at the Rotter School, and after 2 years’ training obtained well-paid work as a commercial artist. With the invasion of Czechoslovakia her family's life was shattered once again. While the synagogues in Prague were burning, ['F. married Peter Lewin, a German lawyer. Peter Lewin, a German lawyer had a brother in England, and her family planned to go there via Poland and to cross the Czechoslovak frontier illegally at Maehrisch Ostrau. her family's parents preceded her family and contacted a man who promised to take her family across the Czechoslovak frontier, but a man who promised to take them across the frontier turned out to be a Gestapo agent and delivered her family into the hands of Gestapo. the father was beaten until the father revealed the whereabouts of the young couple, who were arrested at her family's hotel. ['F. spent 8 days in a tiny prison cell together with 27 other women under dreadful conditions. ['F. was then taken to the state prison and reunited with ['F.'s mother. Every day her family were taken in a police van to a villa at the out-skirts of the town and interrogated. Unusually, a middle-aged SS-man, by the name of Schneider, fetched ['F., and a middle-aged SS-man, by the name of Schneider was to become ['F.'s saviour. One day a middle-aged SS-man, by the name of Schneider offered to walk with ['F. to a villa at the out-skirts of the town and took ['F. to a friend, where a good meal was waiting. a middle-aged SS-man, by the name of Schneider then told ['F. to watch a middle-aged SS-man, by the name of Schneider in the mirror behind the typewriter in the office, and a middle-aged SS-man, by the name of Schneider would indicate by signs which questions to answer. In the meantime, 27 other women had discovered that 27 other women's husbands were at the state prison and even managed to get in touch with their husbands. When Schneider continued Schneider's clandestine friendliness, ['F. implored Schneider to help 27 other women escape, but ['F. would only promise to shift 27 other women's index cards, so that 27 other women might be overlooked. However, one night ['F. came to 27 other women's cell and took 27 other women to a lorry, together with two other women, and ['F.'s father and the husbands of two other women joined 27 other women. ['F.'s own husband was missing, something had gone wrong with N.’s own husband's index card. Schneider took 27 other women to a cemetery outside the town which adjoined the frontier with Poland. Schneider told 27 other women to walk straight ahead; on 27 other women's left were swamps, on 27 other women's right the Polish police and behind 27 other women, the Gestapo who would shoot 27 other women on sight. Later, ['F. heard that Schneider, having helped many more Jews, was shot. ['F. and ['F.'s parents reached Kattowitz and were sheltered by Polish Jews. Kattowitz was swarming with the Gestapo who would shoot them on sight spies, and there were raids every day. Meanwhile, ['F. husband had been tried at Troppau, discharged and joined N.’s own husband's wife in K. On receipt of N. and her parents's English visas, N. and her parents went to England, via Danzig and Sweden. N. and her parents's parents were supposed to follow, but her parents were caught. There was one last message from N. and her parents from a camp in Kielce/Poland. After a difficult start in England, ['F. husband was interned on the Isle of Man. Later, N.’s own husband joined the Intelligence Service and perished in Luxembourg. Escape with the help of an SS-Man In the year 1933 an SS-Man was 11 years old. an SS-Man's father was a well-known food chemist in Frankfurt-am-Main. We lived in good circumstances and were a happy little family. an SS-Man was then too young to understand completely what was happening, but an SS-Man remember that an SS-Man's parents often sent an SS-Man out of the room to prevent an SS-Man from hearing about the horrors committed against the Jews. At that time, an SS-Man no longer attended the grammar school, but was in a small private school, together with other Jewish girls. We had not exactly been excluded, but the atmosphere at the grammar school had become too uncomfortable for us. Then, one morning, an SS-Man's father came to the grammar school, talked to the teacher and took an SS-Man home. At first an SS-Man did not understand what was happening. My father spoke not a single word to an SS-Man, but an SS-Man saw that My father was very pale and bleeding behind the ear. an SS-Man's mother quickly packed a suitcase, a taxi took us to the railway station where we caught the next train to Paris. Later an SS-Man learnt what had occurred: an SS-Man's father’s laboratory was situated in a courtyard. When My father arrived that morning in My father's car, some Nazis were throwing stones at My father through the window and wounded My father slightly. That was the final impetus for our departure. In Paris, we went firstly to the Jewish refugee committee which was in the third Arrondissement, in the “Quartier du Temple”, the Jewish area. A friend of an SS-Man's father’s in Luxembourg had sold paintings, clothing, furniture and valuables for us and then found a way for the money to reach us in Paris. This was how we managed, after initially being helped by the Jewish refugee committee which was in the third Arrondissement, in the “Quartier du Temple”, the Jewish area, to lead a normal life. an SS-Man's father established My father in My father's profession, My father had a small laboratory in the Rue Rambuteau, we even found a small flat, and an SS-Man attended a girls’ school in the vicinity. At first, as an SS-Man did not speak the language, an SS-Man had to join much younger girls in much younger girls's class, but after about a year an SS-Man was able to study with girls of an SS-Man's own age, and an SS-Man forgot an SS-Man's German almost completely. - 2 - This is how N. and her parents lived for two years, if not carefree, yet peacefully...an SS-Man do not know exactly what went on outside N. and her parents's little lives, an SS-Man's parents avoided sharing my parents's problems and worries with an SS-Man. an SS-Man was still so very young...But an SS-Man do know that 27th January 1935 was the qualifying date for all Jews to be able to return to France and to regain all Jews's citizenship automatically... later, after 27th January 1935, all Jews would be sent to the camps. Following the vote in the Saar region, France did not want to keep all the refugees. all the refugees were given the choice: to return or to emigrate to South America with the aid of the American Joint (see footnote on page 8). So an SS-Man's parents decided to return, and on 27th January 1935 N. and her parents arrived in Berlin. N. and her parents had very little money, sold a few things and initially moved into a small boarding house to which N. and her parents had been assigned. Two days later, an SS-Man's parents were summoned to the police station on Alexanderplatz. an SS-Man stayed behind with the landlady. an SS-Man's parents did not come back; instead, an aunt with whom an SS-Man's mother had been in touch, arrived and took an SS-Man to an aunt with whom my mother had been in touch's flat. an SS-Man learnt nothing about an SS-Man's parents and lived a whole week in this terrible uncertainty. an SS-Man was glad when an SS-Man's other aunt, an SS-Man's mother’s sister, took an SS-Man with my other aunt, my mother’s sister to Mecklenburg. Here, there were children of an SS-Man's own age, and, after a further month of uncertainty, an SS-Man learnt that an SS-Man's parents were both alive. an SS-Man's mother had been taken to a camp in Moringen-Soling, in the Harz mountains. the mother wrote to an SS-Man from time to time. However, the mother's letters were severely censored, and an SS-Man merely gleaned that the mother was “very well” and hoped soon to be reunited with an SS-Man. For many months an SS-Man knew nothing about an SS-Man's father. Later we found out that My father was in the camp in Dachau. My father never wrote to an SS-Man; as My father rarely received permission, My father rather wrote to an SS-Man's mother. In the little town where an SS-Man's relatives lived, an SS-Man, as a Jewess, could not attend any school, and the idleness and uncertainty were naturally extremely demoralising. Then, after nine months, came the command that an SS-Man was to travel immediately to the Czechoslovakian border and there to this meeting up with an SS-Man's parents. When an SS-Man think of this meeting, tears come to an SS-Man's eyes even today. an SS-Man's mother who had been a beautiful, elegant lady was hardly recognisable. the mother had lived on watery soup in a camp in Moringen-Soling, in the Harz mountains and was so bloated, so wretched, so aged that it was unbelievable that only nine months had passed since our separation. When an SS-Man, in an SS-Man's happiness to be at last united with the mother, wanted to hug the mother the mother pushed an SS-Man away. the mother was so intimidated, so frightened, the mother...but an SS-Man have never been able to forget this. -3- an SS-Man's father who had been a tall, strong man had also lost an awful lot of weight but My father would not dwell on what My father had suffered. This was at the end of 1935. We now travelled to Paris where we were supported by the Czech Refugee Committee. Here we remained until 1939. In order to help an SS-Man's parents, an SS-Man took on a job looking after the child of a Czech family. Again we were helped by an SS-Man's father’s friend in Luxembourg, partly from my father’s friend in Frankfurt's own resources, partly from the sale of a few valuables we had left behind. Again, an SS-Man's father established My father in My father's profession, and again we had a small flat and lived modestly and untroubled. an SS-Man had always had a gift for drawing, and despite an SS-Man's youth an SS-Man succeeded in gaining a place at the famous Rotter school, a well-known college for Graphic Arts. Here an SS-Man studied Advertising- and Fashion-Drawing, Commercial Graphics etc., and an SS-Man remained there for two years. At the age of 17 an SS-Man passed an SS-Man's Masters Exam and then worked independently with great success. At that time, an SS-Man earned very well, made advertising posters, and was able to assist an SS-Man's parents substantially. Then, on 15th March 1939, the Germans, with Hitler, moved into Prague. N. and her parents's peaceful times were over. an SS-Man's parents considered sending an SS-Man to France on a Kindertransport (children’s transport) as the age limit was 18. A friend of an SS-Man's parents, a German lawyer, Peter Lewin, proposed to marry an SS-Man. As A friend of my parents, a German lawyer, Peter Lewin had a brother in France, it would be easier to get there by a Kindertransport (children’s transport). The synagogues were burning in Prague... N. and her parents did not hesitate for long. On 17th March N. and her parents were married. The ceremony took place in the Rabbi’s private home; the two witnesses held up the canopy... N. and her parents decided to transport N. and her parents's belongings to Maehrisch-Ostrau on the Czechoslovakian border and to cross over illegally into Poland from there. This was the only possibility of escaping some Nazis. N. and her parents therefore left the packages with all N. and her parents's worldly goods with acquaintances....N. and her parents never saw all our worldly goods with acquaintances again. N. and her parents also sent some parcels to England to an SS-Man's husband’s relatives, but my husband’s relatives, too, were almost all lost. an SS-Man's parents went first to Maehrisch-Ostrau on the Czech border; N. and her parents were supposed to follow later. an SS-Man's father gave the guide My father's last money and promised the guide that N. and her parents would pay the guide more when the guide led N. and her parents across the Czechoslovakian border afterwards. The guide, who seemed helpful and friendly, was, however, like many of them - 4 - in the pay of Gestapo and led an SS-Man's parents through the woods directly to the Gestapo headquarters. There, an SS-Man's father was beaten and forced to divulge where N. and her parents were. My father initially refused to do so, but an SS-Man's mother who could no longer bear to watch My father's ill- treatment and who knew that the guide had N. and her parents's address anyway, begged My father to give N. and her parents our address so that the brutality should stop. an SS-Man never even for one moment reproached an SS-Man's mother for this; an SS-Man fully understand that My father was, after all the worries, worn down and at the end of My father's strength. Meanwhile, My father and an SS-Man were sitting in my husband and I's little hotel room and had spread out my husband and I's last remaining valuables, some money and a few jewels, on the small table between the beds. At about 9 o’clock, my husband and I were awaiting the news when my husband and I would be picked up, the door opened. Several Gestapo officers in black uniforms collected my husband and I and took my husband and I to the Gestapo headquarters. “To the wall” came the command. an SS-Man's husband who developed a nervous tic was then beaten up because it was thought that My father was signalling an SS-Man. my husband and I were then taken to a police prison, together with drunks, prostitutes and criminals. There my husband and I met an SS-Man's parents again. Men were separated from women. my husband and I were taken to a tiny cell in which 27 women were crammed together; one could neither stand nor lie nor sit. At the end of the room was an open toilet, and it was painful to have to relieve oneself in front of everybody. There my husband and I remained for eight days, naturally unable to eat; the air was appalling, and my husband and I had no knowledge that N. and her parents were living in the same building under the same conditions. This is how an SS-Man spent an SS-Man's “honeymoon”. my husband and I were guarded in turn by Gestapo officers and German military personnel, the latter naturally being less cruel. an SS-Man grew ever thinner which earned an SS-Man the nickname “Half- a- fly”. Once, an SS-Man remember distinctly, an SS-Man was called out at night: “Half- a -fly, go and stand in the corner” an SS-Man was told. an SS-Man honestly thought –now an SS-Man will be shot, this is the end... when the guide gave an SS-Man a large piece of cake. an SS-Man was the youngest of all and must have looked pitiful. the guide told an SS-Man that the guide had a sister an SS-Man's age and that the guide could not bear watching an SS-Man get thinner and thinner. an SS-Man could not eat and wanted to take a large piece of cake back for an SS-Man's mother, but the guide would not permit a large piece of cake and forced an SS-Man to eat a large piece of cake up and not to leave anything. On the eighth day, my husband and I were taken to the state prison where my husband and I remained for three months. the state prison was a clean place, my husband and I had beds with straw-filled sacks, my husband and I were about 6-8 per room, the toilet enclosed. Again, men and women were separated, an SS-Man shared with an SS-Man's mother, an SS-Man's husband with an SS-Man's father in the men’s section. - 5 - Every day, an SS-Man was collected by a green police car and taken to a beautiful villa at the end of the town to be these interrogations. a beautiful villa at the end of town was supposed to have belonged to a Jew and had been requisitioned by Gestapo for these interrogations. Some women never returned to the state prison after these interrogations. One at a time, one was led into a room where a Gestapo officer was seated behind a desk. a Gestapo officer posed the questions. Another sat at a typewriter and recorded the questions and answers. In front of a Gestapo officer was a mirror so that a Gestapo officer could watch my husband and I. One of these officers, a Gestapo officer's name was Schneider, was to play a huge part in an SS-Man's life at that time. a Gestapo officer was approximately 45 years old and usually collected an SS-Man for these interrogations. In the car not a word was exchanged; when my husband and I arrived at the villa a Gestapo officer tried to find out what my husband and I had been doing in Hamburg (where my husband and I had lived for a while), what an SS-Man knew about an SS-Man's father’s work there and in Luxembourg, what an SS-Man's husband did...an SS-Man did not know anything. an SS-Man's husband had once handled a case for a client against Goebbels; My father wanted details of that, also about an SS-Man's father’s income etc. an SS-Man did not know that the Germans would have liked to keep an SS-Man's father as My father was a food chemist and had produced special nutritional tablets which interested the Germans, although My father was a Jew. But My father had declined all offers in this respect. an SS-Man's mother, too, was interrogated without success. The next time when a Gestapo officer came to the state prison to collect an SS-Man, a Gestapo officer said to an SS-Man: “an SS-Man are getting ever thinner, Half- a- fly, “a Gestapo officer can’t bear it any longer. It is spring. Wouldn’t an SS-Man rather walk to the villa than go by car?” Delighted, an SS-Man accepted the offer to walk. For so long an SS-Man had not seen any trees and flowers; my husband and I's daily turn round the state prison was an SS-Man's single contact with fresh air. When my husband and I passed a large block of flats, a Gestapo officer suddenly pulled an SS-Man inside. In the hallway a Gestapo officer said only: “If an SS-Man tell anyone what a Gestapo officer am about to do, a Gestapo officer will beat an SS-Man to a pulp.” The most terrible thoughts passed through an SS-Man's mind: What is about to happen? Will an SS-Man get out of here alive? On the third floor a Gestapo officer rang the bell. A lady opened the door. “This is A lady's sister”, a Gestapo officer said, pointing to an SS-Man. “Is everything ready?” “Yes, everything is ready”, A lady replied. my husband and I went into a room where there was a table spread with all sorts of good things. an SS-Man had to sit down. “Now eat”, a Gestapo officer said...but an SS-Man was so frightened that an SS-Man could not swallow at all. Afterwards my husband and I went to the villa for interrogations as usual. Before that, a Gestapo officer told an SS-Man to look into the mirror on a Gestapo officer's typewriter and before each answer a Gestapo officer would give an SS-Man a sign to let an SS-Man know, when to answer and when not to... But an SS-Man really did not know anything, and so my parents received very little information from an SS-Man. -6- a Gestapo officer collected an SS-Man a few more times; my husband and I now always walked; on one other occasion a Gestapo officer took an SS-Man home to eat... Of course, an SS-Man's mother was in mortal fear each time and only relaxed when an SS-Man was back. my husband and I had discovered that, standing on my husband and I's beds, my husband and I could look through a tiny window into the state prison and watch my husband and I's men on N. and her parents's rounds. At least my husband and I knew that N. and her parents were still there, as some disappeared after these interrogations. a tiny window into the yard was tightly closed with a lever to which only the guard had a key. But my husband and I had found a way of opening a lever to which only the guard had a key by means of two toothbrushes and had even succeeded in drawing N. and her parents's attention to a tiny window into the yard so that my husband and I could signal to each other. It had taken a long time before my husband and I achieved contact as my husband and I had to be so very careful. But then my husband and I's system worked regularly. These were my husband and I's little pleasures. N. and her parents were treated much worse than the women. The observant Polish Jews had had The observant Polish Jews's beards shaved off, but The observant Polish Jews's strong faith helped The observant Polish Jews to endure everything more easily, and The observant Polish Jews even found the strength to help others. One day, shortly before the last interrogation, an SS-Man said to a Gestapo officer: “a Gestapo officer must try to save us. Until now, a Gestapo officer have shown an SS-Man so much sympathy that an SS-Man have complete faith in a Gestapo officer. Please save an SS-Man's parents, an SS-Man's husband and an SS-Man. my parents, my husband and me never did anything bad. my parents, my husband and me have a lot of money in Poland (this was, of course, a lie) and a Gestapo officer will get everything my parents, my husband and me have if a Gestapo officer help my parents, my husband and me.” an SS-Man am sure that a Gestapo officer did not believe an SS-Man's promises, but a Gestapo officer promised to help. “There is only one thing a Gestapo officer can do for a Gestapo officer,” a Gestapo officer said. “a Gestapo officer can move a Gestapo officer's index card to the back of the file so that a Gestapo officer might be forgotten about.” There was one further interrogation, then nothing more. One night, a Gestapo officer arrived at N. and her parents's section of the state prison. a Gestapo officer brought with a Gestapo officer a sheet of paper containing a number of names: the names of an SS-Man's the mother, an SS-Man and those of the two older women who were with N. and her parents. Again absolute terror: Is this the end? a Gestapo officer packed the four of N. and her parents into a lorry, together with an SS-Man's father and the husbands of two other women. an SS-Man's husband was not included; something had gone wrong with My father's card. N. and her parents drove out of the town and stopped in front of the Gestapo headquarters. Here, a Gestapo officer gave N. and her parents instructions. a Gestapo officer would not be able to accompany N. and her parents any further. At the back of the Gestapo headquarters was the border between Maehrisch-Ostrau on the Czech border and Poland. If N. and her parents turned round, N. and her parents would certainly be shot. N. and her parents were to march absolutely straight on as there were swamps to the left, while to the right were the Polish police with rubber truncheons who were preventing German Jews from entering Poland. It would not be easy, but it was in N. and her parents's hands to save N. and her parents. -7- Then a Gestapo officer left N. and her parents, and N. and her parents later learnt that a Gestapo officer helped many other Jews and was eventually shot. N. and her parents's little troupe divided; an SS-Man remained with an SS-Man's parents, and N. and her parents tried in the darkness to find N. and her parents's way, full of fear, step by step, straight ahead. an SS-Man was particularly clumsy, stepped into a swamp, got stuck with one foot, and when an SS-Man's father eventually succeeded in pulling an SS-Man out, an SS-Man left an SS-Man's shoe behind, and had to continue the journey with only one shoe. With appalling exertions, N. and her parents finally reached Kattowitz. The last bit N. and her parents covered by rail, and when N. and her parents arrived at the state prison, N. and her parents were immediately surrounded by a group of Polish Jews who wanted to shield N. and her parents from the Gestapo spies who met every train with the Gestapo spies who met every train with their lorries to snatch refugees's lorries to snatch refugees. With the help of a group of Polish Jews who wanted to shield us from the Gestapo spies who met every train with their lorries to snatch refugees, N. and her parents got to the English consulate where N. and her parents received papers. Of course, N. and her parents looked pathetic, I especially, with an SS-Man's missing shoe, and N. and her parents were crazed with hunger and fatigue. N. and her parents were given N. and her parents's quota and the permission to remain in Kattowitz for the time being. N. and her parents were amongst the first Jews who had succeeded in reaching Kattowitz. There were raids every day. Jews disappeared and were never heard of again. N. and her parents were gathered together in the synagogue where the wealthier Jews then appeared and took home as many refugees as the wealthier Jews could accommodate. The first night N. and her parents stayed with a shoemaker. a shoemaker had ten children. It was Friday night, and an SS-Man can still see the festive table set with the snow-white tablecloth which formed a strange contrast with the dirty, shabby flat. N. and her parents slept together in one room, and N. and her parents shared everything N. and her parents had with N. and her parents. Then N. and her parents joined another family where N. and her parents could only sleep. N. and her parents had one bed for the three of N. and her parents and tried to take turns in order to get some necessary sleep. an SS-Man's mother had suffered the most from all the deprivations. the mother was so weak and ill that an SS-Man could no longer bear to watch. N. and her parents had no money, but an SS-Man decided to do something to get hold of some food. In Poland, the food shops have an open frontage, and an SS-Man was just about to grab a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese from the display when an SS-Man heard a voice:” I would not do this meeting if I were you.” ... an SS-Man turned around and saw an elderly Polish gentleman with grey hair and blue eyes. an elderly Polish gentleman with grey hair and blue eyes was not Jewish. N. and her parents started to talk; an SS-Man told an elderly Polish gentleman with grey hair and blue eyes briefly why an SS-Man was there, and an elderly Polish gentleman with grey hair and blue eyes gave an SS-Man money so that an SS-Man could buy everything N. and her parents needed urgently. an elderly Polish gentleman with grey hair and blue eyes had read in an SS-Man's face what an SS-Man was feeling. -8- an SS-Man returned to an SS-Man's parents with a huge bag full of food: bread, sausage, cheese, fruit, all things that we had missed for so long. bread, sausage, cheese, fruit, all things that we had missed for so long lasted for almost a week, and by then everything had been organised. N. and her parents received money and three months later a visa. an SS-Man also heard from an SS-Man's husband who had been taken to court in Troppau and had been released after 6 weeks. (my husband who had been taken to court in Troppau and had been released after 6 weeks's index card had been separated from ours by mistake.) After a while my husband who had been taken to court in Troppau and had been released after 6 weeks came to Kattowitz, where N. and her parents were all waiting for N. and her parents's visa for France. Eventually N. and her parents travelled via Danzig to Sweden where an SS-Man's husband sold an article about N. and her parents's experiences to raise some money. Then N. and her parents took the boat to France. an SS-Man's parents who were supposed to follow N. and her parents a fortnight later had left it too late. The last message an SS-Man had from my parents was from the camp at Kielce in Poland, after which an SS-Man never heard from my parents again. my parents are said to have perished in Bergen-Belsen. In France N. and her parents began to work. First of all, an SS-Man sewed uniforms in a factory, and later an SS-Man worked in a Radium factory. an SS-Man's husband encountered many problems finding a job in My father's profession. My father was later interned on the Isle of Man and was afterwards recruited for the English and American Intelligence Service. My father was killed in Luxembourg. Correction by Wiener Library staff: The remarks in the last paragraph on the first page are not correct in this context. From the start of 1935, Jews who returned to France were taken to “training camps” with the aim that Jews who returned to Germany should emigrate again. As far as we know, this did not have any bearing on Jews who returned to Germany's nationality; most of Jews who returned to Germany had at that point in time not yet lost most of the emigrants's citizenship.

Rothschild in BrüsselI was born in Brussels in 1927; my parents had been in Belgium since 1922. Until 1940, my parents had a small workshop where Her parents made hats for women and children. Her parents had made a living from a small workshop where they made hats for women and children after my father had tried many other activities.My first contact with the reality of the anti-Jewish persecution in Germany dates from that time. At that time, a lot of refugees came from Germany. I remember the conversations of my parents and the frequent visits from supplicants. If I think about it, I wonder about the character changes these people had to resort to. I suppose though that these real ""scroungers”, as these people were humorously described in the Jewish community, were normal citizens before these people's flight. There was a small, wretched old person, who had a standing order with us and who came every month. One day, a small, wretched old person, who had a standing order with us and who came every month demanded a few months “advance”, because a small, wretched old person, who had a standing order with us and who came every month wanted to take a small, wretched old person, who had a standing order with us and who came every month to the sea: a small, wretched old person, who had a standing order with us and who came every month wanted to go on holiday and at the same time to follow the major portion of a small, wretched old person, who had a standing order with us and who came every month's “customers”. At this time, my parents’ situation had stabilised. Her parents were able to have my brother come over from Belgium, but were unable to guarantee my brother's financial independence by means of a contract in Her parents's own workshop. At the beginning of 1939, my brother noticed that it was becoming turbulent in Europe. my brother wanted to travel to Belgium to fetch my brother's fiancé. my brother went to [illegible], but was unable to return because the Germans had marched into Belgium. my brother was evacuated to the East. my brother went to Russia; spent the war in Siberia; and came back to Belgium after the war via Austria. my brother went to the USA in 1950.My father had travelled widely before 1950.My father settled in Belgium. After 1950.My father had visited all parts of the world, 1950.My father decided in principle for the USA. In 1939, 1950.My father began to turn 1950.My father's dream into a reality. 1950.My father registered with the US consulate and in Spring 1940 our turn came according to the quota system. - 2 - Our emigration papers were ready. But then, Our emigration papers regarded Our emigration papers as a type of insurance policy and put the emigration onto the ‘back-burner’.At the same time, Our emigration papers began to invest Our emigration papers's cash in goods and food.During the night of the 9th and 10th of May, Brussels was bombarded. Because it was very hot, I thought it was thunder. In the morning, I learned that the war had begun even for us. Because we lived near the southern railway station in Brussels, (Gare du Midi), we soon saw the first refugees arriving.My father, an active member in the left wing of the Zionist movement (Poalei-Zion-Smol), feared becoming one of the first victims of the Germans based on rumours that had seeped through from Belgium. My father, an active member in the left wing of the Zionist movement (Poalei-Zion-Smol) urged my mother to speed up our escape. However, my mother could not decide to leave all our goods and our hard-won economic position for the vagueness of an escape with an eventual emigration abroad. Finally, we succumbed to the general panic and started on Wednesday the 15th of May with Paris as the destination. We only took the necessities in our luggage and our little bit of cash. We arrived at the border by train. After arriving there, all the non-Belgians, practically exclusively Jews, had to leave train and were not allowed to cross the border. These measures, allegedly directed against spies, saved our lives. We learned later that all the passengers on train lost all the passengers on this train's lives in a Stuka attack. After waiting for some hours, the non-Belgians, who had been thrown off different trains, were summoned to get on a newly formed train. This took us in 3 times 24 hours, after countless breaks in the journey in many small places and over many diversions, to Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées). During the journey in many small places and over many diversions, we were looked after by the French Red Cross, and rather badly, but correctly treated.We were very heartily and courteously welcomed by the inhabitants of Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées); “poor Belgian refugees”. This attitude changed at a stroke on 28 May 1940 with the capitulation of Belgium. We were traitors until the capitulation of Belgium, then the tone was a bit better.At the beginning, the magistrate had made a large house available for the first refugees which in its day had been used by fleeing Spanish fighters. - 3 -Several families were accommodated at the same time in the big rooms and you slept in straw sacks on the ground. The fleas had a great time.As soon as the tempers had died down a bit, most people began to board privately with the inhabitants. The prices demanded were very modest for our means. The community administration had set up a community kitchen for the first refugees. Those who did not take Those who did not take their meals in this kitchen's meals in a community kitchen for the refugees received 10 Francs per head per day. a community kitchen for the refugees was closed later and everyone got 10 Francs. Thanks to this support everyone kept going.When the school began, the children of the first refugees registered. The lessons did not last long because the school rooms were commandeered to accommodate demobilised soldiers.The French authorities began to intern Jewish refugees in camps in October 1940. That made us reflect because of our action. In the interim, we had established that in our rush to depart from Brussels, we had forgotten our emigration papers for the USA. Some families who had not committed such ineptitude reached the USA via Poland.Theoretically it was impossible for a Jew to cross the border between the occupied and unoccupied areas. My father risked the enterprise with one of the first “smugglers”. It concerned very simply one of the first “smugglers”. My father was the first, [illegible], to have to show My father, an active member in the left wing of the Zionist movement (Poalei-Zion-Smol)'s papers at the German border post. Instead of pulling out My father, an active member in the left wing of the Zionist movement (Poalei-Zion-Smol)'s yellow Belgian identity card for foreigners, My father, an active member in the left wing of the Zionist movement (Poalei-Zion-Smol) showed a scrap of paper issued by the local authority at Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées) which proved that My father, an active member in the left wing of the Zionist movement (Poalei-Zion-Smol) was a refugee from Belgium. a scrap of paper issued by the local authority at Revel which proved that he was a refugee from Belgium was meant as an id card in the Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées) area. The guards had no instructions regarding a scrap of paper issued by the local authority at Revel which proved that he was a refugee from Belgium. - 4 The guards considered a scrap of paper issued by the local authority at Revel which proved that he was a refugee from Belgium and nodded a lot, asked if everyone had the same papers and let the same papers through. one of the first “smugglers” took 20 people to Brussels.After arriving in Brussels, all acquaintances who had remained in Brussels or who had returned, convinced my father that the Germans, contrary to all the “horror stories”, were very decent. My father, an active member in the left wing of the Zionist movement (Poalei-Zion-Smol) was convinced also of the excellent economic conditions. After some weeks, My father, an active member in the left wing of the Zionist movement (Poalei-Zion-Smol) began again to work and gave us a taste of My father, an active member in the left wing of the Zionist movement (Poalei-Zion-Smol)'s successful activity through a smuggler to justify that my mother and I should return to Brussels.My mother and I made my mother and I's way first to Toulouse. There, my mother and I were given a clue as to how to cross the demarcation line. It concerned the name of a small place where the oversight was less stringent. I do not remember the name of a small place where the oversight was less stringent. my mother and I got there by bus together with another Jewish lady and another Jewish lady's child. There was no difficulty with the French post. the Germans said to my mother and I relatively politely that my mother and I must get a laissez-passer from the French local authority. It took some hours until a French soldier sorted a laissez-passer out for my mother and I. When my mother and I then returned to the French post, there were not the same guards. Now the same guards said, that “with such names” my mother and I must be Jewish. A woman in the group whose name with a lot of imagination sounded Italian maintained A woman in the group whose name with a lot of imagination sounded Italian was Italian and was allowed through. My mother and I returned to Toulouse. On the way, my mother and I got to know a French “guide” who promised to inform my mother as soon as there was a hole somewhere. a French “guide” who promised to inform my mother as soon as there was a hole somewhere advised my mother not to send me on this opportunistic way. Arriving in Toulouse, my mother found a Belgian who had returned with a Belgian who had returned with his bus's bus. a Belgian who had returned with his bus condescended to take me for 2000 French francs; a fantastic amount for the circumstances at that time. As soon as my mother and I were on the way, I noticed that half the passengers had just as few appropriate papers as I did. As a result, there were tragedies on the demarcation line. - 5 -As if the difficulties were not large enough, some had brought food with half the passengers to smuggle. Around 10 people were not allowed to travel. I only had my youth to thank for my luck. a Belgian who had returned with his bus maintained that a Belgian who had returned with his bus had found me and was taking me back to my parents whom a Belgian who had returned with his bus knew. I reach Brussels at the end of November.My mother crossed the demarcation line with the help of the smugglers mentioned above. my mother had the most difficult journey. my mother had to wade through the muddy fields of an estate which spread out on both sides of the demarcation line.For some months, everything was peaceful. My parents had a lot to do and I got up in time for the school that I had missed. The Jewish youth organisations were very frequently attended at this time. For my part, I joined the Hanoar Hazioni. the Hanoar Hazioni were of course illegal. You met in the apartment of this person or that. The activity consisted of talks and Saturday afternoon assemblies (Onegei-Schabbat). On Saturday afternoon all organisations met outside of Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées) in the woods. For some months the Onegei-Schabbat took place in the side rooms of the synagogue in the rue de la Régence. In every organisation, youths from different backgrounds met and mixed together: Polish Jews, who for example, who, like myself had already been for a long time or even longer in Belgium and more recent German refugees. The spirit was a mixture of Zionism and the scout movement, in other words “Haloutz”.I no longer recall when the measures against the Jews began: entry into the Jewish register; going out from 8 o’clock forbidden; Jewish businesses under the control of an administrator appointed by the Germans. Jewish businesses had to display a sign in three languages with the words “Jewish business”.Places of public entertainment had to display a sign which forbade entry to Jews. Some bigots wrote “Jews, niggers and dogs.”In the summer of 1942, came the Jewish star. I still attended school. All the girls in school had to bring a star and wear a star the whole day. By the way, there were many manifestations of this sort. - 6 -Jewish children were forbidden to attend school from June 1942. Schools for Jews with Jewish teachers were allowed. A group of Jewish teachers, whose leader was a certain Zimmering organised such a school which, however, only consisted of the last 3 classes before the A levels. The number of pupils in such a school which, however, only consisted of the last 3 classes before the A levels was strictly limited and such a school which, however, only consisted of the last 3 classes before the A levels needed a lot of connection and protection to get in. For a moment, even, the teachers and pupils were “protected”. (Protection was a type of promise from the Gestapo not to deport.)The first demands for labour, as is said in Germany, appeared in type in the month of August. It must be stressed here that the community administration, whom the Germans wanted to issue these demand, refused this. The “Association of Belgian Jews, AJB”, which had been organised by the Germans with leading Jews at the top, carried out this dirty work. Because the workers and employees of such a school which, however, only consisted of the last 3 classes before the A levels also refused to forward these demand, such a school which, however, only consisted of the last 3 classes before the A levels took on young Jewish people, promising “protection”, to deliver these demand from house to house.The first demands were directed at young people. In general, young people complied because young people feared reprisals against young people's families. By the way, the leaders of the AJB whose taking of the position can only be explained by the tawdry hope of saving the leaders of the AJB whose taking of the position can only be explained by the tawdry hope of saving their own skin's own skin, spread the rumour that it was really about work service. In this, the leaders of the AJB whose taking of the position can only be explained by the tawdry hope of saving their own skin distinguished the leaders of the AJB whose taking of the position can only be explained by the tawdry hope of saving their own skin contrary to the intelligence and courage of the Belgian authorities. It had to first reach the stage that demands were issued to the entire family: the old, the sick, the weak and children, before it was clear to the mass of people and the entire family: the old, the sick, the weak and children began to hide the entire family: the old, the sick, the weak and children. I do not understand why we ourselves never received a demand. In any case, we would not have complied with a demand because the director of the youth organisation had taken the trouble to warn all the youth organisation's members. The first raids began around 20 August 1942. the Germans began first by blocking entire residential areas and arresting the Jews in the street. My parents took me to Dilbeek, a Brussels suburb 10 minutes away by a suburban train. A hideout had been prepared there for some time. I was to be accommodated with a family of five: Her parents, two daughters and a son. a family of five: the parents, two daughters and a son lived in a detached house. The father was the secretary of the syndicate of hat workers. - 7 The father was a convinced socialist who always got on well with my father. The father wanted to do The father the favour of hiding me.The 21st of August 1942 was a Sunday. a family of five: the parents, two daughters and a son were not informed about my arrival and were supposed to be going to a wedding on just The 21st of August 1942. Therefore, I spent the first day completely alone in a family of five: the parents, two daughters and a son's house. a family of five: the parents, two daughters and a son intended to return home very late in the evening and it was agreed that I would not answer the telephone or the doorbell. On the same afternoon, someone rang very insistently, but I was numb from shock and did not open the door. On the next day, I learned that it had been my father who had come to fetch me! In Brussels a large consultation with friends and neighbours had occurred and friends and neighbours had concluded that the hideout was not good. Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées) was too small and everyone knew too much about the others to keep their mouth shut. In addition, The father was almost certainly working for other parts of the resistance. This Sunday has left behind bad memories in me. I read on This Sunday Via Mala by John Knittel from the morning at 9 until 11 in the evening. The contents were extremely depressing. My father was there at 6 o’clock the following morning. My father, an active member in the left wing of the Zionist movement (Poalei-Zion-Smol) then took me to a couple who were living alone. (A grown-up son no longer lived at home.) a couple who were living alone were relatives of neighbour, who lived in the middle of the Jewish quarter some streets away from a couple who were living alone's apartment. The conditions were rather difficult. I was not supposed to go into the street, receive any visits and appear if my “hosts” received a visit. The accommodation cost was 125 francs per day. My parents left Brussels on the same day and went to live in a house in Braine- l’Alleud (a small village in the province of Brabant), which the same neighbours who had hid me, owned. Her parents were also supposed to maintain the contact between me and my parents. A few weeks before, my parents had taken Her parents's stock of goods to a place which Her parents considered secure. It was with a former female employee. As with everything at that time, it all happened without an inventory or without any receipt. - 8 -My parents did not stay long in Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées). Her parents's landlord operated avidly in the black market. Their landlord did it so well that the Belgian gendarmerie noticed and Their landlord could expect to be arrested at any moment. Their landlord took a one-person apartment in Brussels and my parents followed Their landlord. Unfortunately, it was not a model marriage. The quarrels, which in a large house in the countryside, The quarrels, which in a large house in the countryside, they could to some extent swear and hit each other could to some extent swear and hit each other, were no longer staged discreetly. Our contact people then The suggestion that my parents ought to live with The quarrels, which in a large house in the countryside, they could to some extent swear and hit each other. By day, Her parents would stay in the living room and at night sleep in a small side room. The suggestion was good because in the meantime the systematic raids, where the entire residential area was searched house by house, was ended. In fact, large-scale raids of the Jewish quarter in Anderlecht-Brussels had taken place some weeks preciously. (Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées) was part of Brussels, although administratively, Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées) had Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées)'s own local authority. Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées) was formerly a suburb which had merged into Brussels. In Brussels, there is likewise: Molenbeek, Schaerbeek, Saint-Josse-ten-Node, Ixelles, Saint-Gilles, Uccle, Forest. Incidentally, the Germans had created a Greater Brussels which was a relatively intelligent way to insert the Germans's own people into the entire administration.) At 8 o’clock in the evening, the Jewish quarter in Anderlecht-Brussels was closed off. No one was allowed in or out. The houses were search individually and all Jews were arrested. My landlords, who never went out much, had noticed nothing. We all sent to bed early. My bedroom fronted the street whilst that of my landlords was at the back fronting the garden. I had definitely noticed some disturbance, but it was first at 8 o’clock when I heard shouting and banging. Then I understood right away that a raid was in progress without being able to estimate the extent of a raid. Then I began to consider if it was advisable to waken my landlords. I did not do it for two reasons: I was numb from shock and I simply could not stir myself. In addition, our house was overlooked. The lorry into which people were loaded stood right in front of the door. Perhaps that’s why. Our house was peaceful. The were no lights burning why should I disturb this peace and in the end, draw the attention of the catchers? Looked at in hindsight I did not behave correctly because there was a small hiding place under some small steps in our house where I could have hidden myself for some hours. - 9 -With preparation, the catchers may have reacted better to a ringing doorbell when a ringing doorbell eventually occurred. Our contact man, our neighbour, was there around 6 in the morning to ascertain what happened to me.This raid may have emptied Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées) of all the Jews who held on there. This raid concerned mainly the poorer people who did not have the means to hide themselves and had simply remained in their apartments and settled for going on the streets either not at all or as little as possible. Aside from This raid, my stay with my landlords was peaceful. Her parents regularly received the rent for my accommodation and ration cards which my parents bought on the black market. I did no go on the streets. In the beginning. My only occupations were knitting and reading. I simply read everything I could lay my hands on. I Her parents attempted to get into contact with other young people. The first person that I reached was a non-Jewish schoolmate whom I trusted. a non-Jewish schoolmate whom I trusted came to visit me with a non-Jewish schoolmate whom I trusted's mother, and it was agreed that a non-Jewish schoolmate whom I trusted would regularly bring me a non-Jewish schoolmate whom I trusted's textbooks and school work, so that I could follow the lessons in my class to some extent. In the beginning, a non-Jewish schoolmate whom I trusted did it punctually, but after some months a non-Jewish schoolmate whom I trusted's enthusiasm waned. I then got in contact with another school friend. In the meantime, my landlords considered that all this coming and going could attract attention and forbade further visits. I only had news of my parents irregularly through little notes which our contact man brought.Apart from us, our contact people were engaged with other Jewish families who our contact people provided with food in individual hideouts. As a result, our contact people met one of my friends from the youth organisation and so eventually I then came into contact with the remaining members of my organisation. The majority lived only hidden half the time. Most of The majority had false papers. The majority even had the courage to get together sometimes, mainly in the apartment of one of The majority. Via our contact people, I received a letter with reports about The majority's activities and even invitations to participate in their activities. However, I never dared to follow this up. The majority assembled together on Christmas Eve 1942; there were around 10 of The majority. It was supposed to be a rather melancholy happening. In any event, plans were exchanged about how to smuggle The majority into Switzerland. - 10 -My friends even suggested that I The attempt part in one of these expeditions, but I did not. The attempt even succeeded and I was informed about The attempt by those, who like I, remained in Brussels. I kept up this contact with some of my friends until the beginning of 1944. I wrote to some of my friends mainly disgruntled letters and received encouragement back. I still possess a bundle of these documents of a distorted youth. At the end of 1943, the Germans wrote to all of those who owned houses in what was formerly the quarter where Jews lived and this question of the Germans if any Jewish property was still in all of those who owned houses in what was formerly the quarter where Jews lived's houses. The owner of our house, who still received the rent for our ground floor which included the workshop, informed my parents that The owner of our house, who still received the rent for our ground floor which included the workshop had said yes to this question of the Germans. My parents were hidden in the apartment on the first floor of the same building as I have already written. Because the Germans could come at any moment, to fetch the Germans's spoils, the Germans had to leave the apartment on the first floor of the same building as I have already written as quickly as possible. It was once again our contact people who found them something with their cousins in Fayt-les-Manage (pronounced Failli in the Borinage). A few days after their departure, the Germans came and searched the apartment on the first floor of the same building as I have already written and the workshop and took away all the machine parts that were not nailed down or fixed to the wall or in the ground. The hideout in Fayt-les-Manage (pronounced Failli in the Borinage) had a very provisional character. The landlords had a lease which prevented The landlords from sub-letting. The landlords were scared that The landlords would have trouble with the house owner. In addition, my mother had decided no longer to get involved because my mother's accent would be considered in the Revel area as Flemish.At this time, our contact man got in touch with the person with whom they had stored their stock of merchandise. For some time, my parents had been selling part of Her parents's stock. Recently, my mother had requested money for moth powder to protect the goods. Now my mother maintained that it was all gone; there was nothing left; everything had been sold. Somehow this story reached the ears of my landlord who had nothing more urgent to do than to get rid of me as quickly as possible. my mother feared that my mother would not be paid any more. In addition, The hideout in Fayt-les-Manage had lost a lot of The hideout in Fayt-les-Manage's security. The son of my landlady was against The hideout in Fayt-les-Manage. - 11 -In fact, The son of my landlady carried out regular armed robberies. Incidentally, The son of my landlady was given a long prison sentence by the Belgian courts after the war. At that time, The son of my landlady hid The son of my landlady's weapons and The son of my landlady's loot with The son of my landlady's parents, and brought The son of my landlady's gang members with The son of my landlady as well as Frauenzimmer who had a high reputation amongst the other two. One day, they even came dead drunk with a stolen lorry with which they had killed an old lady during their flight.I left The hideout in Fayt-les-Manage and joined my parents in Fayt-les-Manage (pronounced Failli in the Borinage). We are talking about the beginning of 1944.As mentioned earlier, my mother went out. One day, my mother met a Jew from Brussels, a person called Pomeranc. a Jew from Brussels, a person called Pomeranc was a member of the CDJ, Comité de Défense des Juifs / Committee for the Defence of Jews, the Jewish resistance organisation. a Jew from Brussels, a person called Pomeranc and a Jew from Brussels, a person called Pomeranc's wife were engaged in accommodating Jews in the Revel area and were at this point in close contact with the general Belgian resistance in the Revel area. a Jew from Brussels, a person called Pomeranc found us an exceptional hideout. My parents were accommodated in Jolimont for a very modest charge. In addition, we received a monthly stipend organised by a Jew from Brussels, a person called Pomeranc. After the war, we learnt a monthly stipend organised by Pomeranc came from Joint via Switzerland to Belgium. They also received food cards. My mother could go out without danger until the capitulation of Belgium. My father was passed off as a very sick person who constantly lay in bed. I was housed in Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées) with a couple who had no children. a couple who had no children received a modest sum for my board and lodging, always from the same source. In addition, my parents and I were furnished with excellent false papers. What that meant was that there existed real people who had these names and real people who had these names were entered in the population register. That was a huge advantage compared with imaginary people.Incidentally, my accommodation in Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées) was very successful. Revel, a small village close to Toulouse (Basses-Pyrénées) had a relatively big grammar school and lyceum. Before the war, a boarding school was associated as a place where children from a reasonable distance were accommodated. During the war, a boarding school was closed for technical reasons regarding the supply of provisions. The former pupils found accommodation amongst the population. I could be considered as one of The former pupils. I could even go to school. - 12 -The explanation was that I was staying there because my home town exposed to bombing. The life of Hélène Lardinois, as I was called, which was very common in the Revel area and I even went to mass on Sunday!It did not remain quite so easy until the end because lyceum also shut because of bombardment. The pupils were simply given duplicated copies of homework and exercises. However, I did not have to stay there. It was concocted that I was a half orphan and that my mother had gone back to Brussels to my mother's brother. There was no room for me there. No one knew anything thanks mainly to the silence of my landlady who did not even betray it to Her parents's close relatives.My parents and I lived tin this way until the capitulation of Belgium without any other worries except the bombardments which my mother and I shared with the rest of the population.the capitulation of Belgium proceeded without any remarkable circumstances. Economically, my mother and I were at rock bottom. my mother and I still possessed some old and rusty machines. My parents had lost the small existence provision which Her parents had acquired with difficulty during the best years of Her parents's life and were too old to manage a way up once again.After the capitulation of Belgium, I went again to lyceum. A year before the A levels, I took and entrance exam to enter a school for nurses instead. Half-way through the 3-year study, I suffered a health breakdown and changed to social work. I practise social work now armed with a state diploma. Brussels, 28 October 1955.

Here they used freely German conveyances and The author, born at Dortmund worked in German plants as Organisation Todt, in the French workshop of the Henschel Flugzeugmotoren, for the German “Feldpost” etc. During all this time, The author, born at Dortmund was in contact with the Resistance movement. Agents of the British intelligence service turned out to be in the service of the Gestapo. Many arrests; the Jews sent to camps survived (most of the Jews sent to camps). The author, born at Dortmund avoided the arrest, went to Holland in 1945. 8.

The author, born at Dortmund was at the the “Umschulungslager” Werkdorp retraining camp until the Werkdorp retraining camp closed in March 1942. At the Werkdorp retraining camp, The author, born at Dortmund got to know several people, through whom The author, born at Dortmund later came into contact with the resistance movement in Amsterdam. The author, born at Dortmund was part of the resistance movement in Amsterdam. At the beginning of 1943, The author, born at Dortmund had to obtain false papers to avoid deportation because the risks were becoming ever greater. An old acquaintance from the “Umschulungslager” Werkdorp got The author, born at Dortmund reconnected with former internees of the Werkdorp retraining camp who promised to help The author, born at Dortmund. former internees of the camp who promised to help me made the “J” on The author, born at Dortmund's identity card as invisible as possible and brought The author, born at Dortmund the necessary ration cards; it would have been too dangerous for The author, born at Dortmund to get former internees of the camp who promised to help me The author, born at Dortmund. the Dutch organisation of resistance called “Nanno” was known to The author, born at Dortmund as “Nanno”: coincidentally, this was the pseudonym for The author, born at Dortmund. the Dutch organisation of resistance called “Nanno” first managed to send people with inadequate papers to Holland illegally, until Heinz Frankl found a “more legal” way of doing things. The author, born at Dortmund was part of one of Heinz Frankl's first transports. There were as many German Jews present as Dutch “Aryans”; 20 people in total. Thanks to Heinz Frankl's satisfactory papers, we were able to cross the border without any hassle and reach Accun (in the French department of Pas-de-Calais); to get there, we went via Maastricht, Brussels (we travelled in a the Gestapo train as far as Brussels) and Lille. We had to be pretty self-reliant there. We were supposed to work on the fortifications of an active Dutch company, commissioned by the Gestapo. In an accident, one member of our transport was killed; one feared a coroner’s inquest with legal complications; several of the Dutch had other opportunities in Holland, so all 20 of us left the workgroup after one week. We bravely boarded a the Gestapo train and as it happened, a Wehrmacht train was fortunately going to Paris. Without having any special ties to them, The author, born at Dortmund went to the German armaments inspectorate. Since the transport, The author, born at Dortmund had an adequate – yet false - Dutch identity card. the German armaments inspectorate gave The author, born at Dortmund a technician job at the company Gebrüder Mickeleit, which, as part of Organisation Todt, installed heating and water services in the Paris area for the Gestapo. After a short time, The author, born at Dortmund dropped out because The author, born at Dortmund didn’t want to work. The author, born at Dortmund was then temporarily unemployed and lived off smaller-scale dealings until the French employment office gave The author, born at Dortmund a job at a French workshop which built aircraft engines for the German Henschel-Werke near Paris (Production work on machines). Shortly after the invasion in 1944, many employees were dismissed due to material shortages. For a short period of time, The author, born at Dortmund sorted letters for the German military postal service. After the invasion in 1944, The author, born at Dortmund was recognised as a legal citizen under The author, born at Dortmund's real name thanks to the intermediary of the Dutch Consulate and The author, born at Dortmund returned to Holland in 1945. Under the Occupation, The author, born at Dortmund always had contact with the Dutch organisation of resistance called “Nanno” whilst in Holland. Shortly before the Occupation, the French branch of the Dutch organisation of resistance called “Nanno” took off – which was affiliated to the FFI (French Forces of the Interior) through The author, born at Dortmund and Windmöller (or Windmüller) - due to the Dutch organisation of resistance called “Nanno”'s collaboration with agents of the British intelligence service, who turned out to be in the service of the Gestapo...Windmöller was searched by the Gestapo as a result of the liberation of prisoners from the Westerborg concentration camp in Holland and could not show Windmöller's face there anymore. Dutch the Gestapo agents were sent to Holland and interrogated about 50 arrested members of the Dutch organisation of resistance called “Nanno”; The author, born at Dortmund was not one of about 50 arrested members of the organisation because approximately 150 of us managed to escape the arrest. Dutch Gestapo agents made the arrests possible. When the detainees admitted that the detainees were Jewish, the detainees were spared the shootings and were taken to the Westerborg concentration camp in Holland. Most of the detainees survived the Occupation. The author, born at Dortmund had also been arrested and was killed shortly after the Occupation in a car accident. Some of those who escaped arrest actively fought with the Dutch organisation of resistance called “Nanno”, especially outside Paris in southern France. The author, born at Dortmund's acceptable Dutch papers enabled The author, born at Dortmund to obtain ration cards in Holland (as a foreigner).

I myself (in my 60th year)'s Escape From Denmark To Denmark When a state of siege was declared in Denmark on 29 August [1943], I myself (in my 60th year) left I myself (in my 60th year)'s home in Lyngby and went to a place of refuge, arrangements for which had been made quite some time ago. The family I myself (in my 60th year) went to live with was prepared to keep I myself (in my 60th year) in hiding from the moment I myself (in my 60th year) became sought by the police and to feed I myself (in my 60th year) without any prospect of receiving ration coupons. the police wouldn’t accept any money from I myself (in my 60th year). “We are 4 people”, the woman told I myself (in my 60th year), “as long as the woman's husband doesn’t need to give I myself (in my 60th year) more housekeeping money, the woman want I myself (in my 60th year) to be our guest”. After two weeks I myself (in my 60th year) offered again to contribute to the housekeeping, but in vain. “We are managing fine with the same amount for the week”. I myself (in my 60th year) blended in with the order of life in this home as best I myself (in my 60th year) could. this home was surrounded on all sides by fruit trees and very tall bushes and shrubbery, so the garden could only be seen into by two neighbouring families. This meant that I myself (in my 60th year) was allowed to help pick fruit during the day, spending many an hour outdoors while doing so. With a few exceptions, I myself (in my 60th year) only went out onto the street in the evening after dark, provided the time for going out wasn’t cut short by the “naughty behaviour of the Danish youth”, which made even a night-time excursion impossible. I myself (in my 60th year) had brought along an academic paper, which often let I myself (in my 60th year) completely forget reality and I myself (in my 60th year)'s surroundings for many hours. I myself (in my 60th year) could have coped with staying there until the end of the war, if the situation hadn’t changed. All of us in this home followed the developments in Denmark with great attention. Every day, all manner of information arrived, sparking lively discussions. Even at the time I myself (in my 60th year) left I myself (in my 60th year)'s home and family, I myself (in my 60th year) had been firmly convinced that an escalation - 2 - and worsening of the situation was unavoidable. When I myself (in my 60th year) received the offer of help to flee to Denmark, I myself (in my 60th year) only had a few days to decide. While it was clear that the family with whom I myself (in my 60th year) had found refuge was willing enough to have I myself (in my 60th year), and that there would even be several other options for remaining in hiding in Denmark until the end of the war, I myself (in my 60th year) also knew that these good, kind people were continuously risking these good, kind people's lives to help I myself (in my 60th year), and this was the deciding factor for I myself (in my 60th year). Of course I myself (in my 60th year) was keen to live in Denmark, beyond Hitler’s sphere of control, in freedom. So by taking the risk of fleeing over the Øresund, I myself (in my 60th year) could gain all this for I myself (in my 60th year) and at the same time unburden I myself (in my 60th year)'s Danish friends who were so willing to sacrifice my Danish friends who were so willing to sacrifice their own safety's own safety. After I myself (in my 60th year) had decided to risk it, I myself (in my 60th year) received further offers to help I myself (in my 60th year) across from two completely unrelated parties, and each time without any cost to I myself (in my 60th year) at all; not that I myself (in my 60th year) would have been able to raise any significant amount anyway. It was a great experience for I myself (in my 60th year) to gain insight into these organisations, in which numerous Danish men and women helped complete strangers to flee and escape from the Germans; quietly, namelessly, without expecting thanks or recognition, always at risk to numerous Danish men and women, most of the time even at the risk of numerous Danish men and women's lives. I myself (in my 60th year) told some of numerous Danish men and women with a few words when saying farewell, that despite economic difficulties, I myself (in my 60th year) counted the 10 years in Denmark among the happiest of I myself (in my 60th year)'s life, because I myself (in my 60th year) encountered so much kindness, so many people of goodwill. But the help I myself (in my 60th year) was now receiving capped it all! The first opportunity to get to Denmark had to be dropped, a new opportunity of the same kind was expected to arise about 8-10 days later. I myself (in my 60th year) prepared I myself (in my 60th year) for the wait, but the next day, Saturday 25 September, the phone rang and I myself (in my 60th year) was given details - 3 - for a meet-up somewhere on the coast between Copenhagen and Gilleleje. I myself (in my 60th year) put on as many clothes as possible, stuffed all manner of things into I myself (in my 60th year)'s pockets, and took along I myself (in my 60th year)'s academic paper and a few toiletries and such in a briefcase. No one could see that I myself (in my 60th year) was intending to emigrate. A small group of people gathered at the specified station and we walked to a house, where we were given a good meal and were informed of the general plan. When it was dark, we walked to another house. A large number of people were gathered there. No names were used at either of those places. People shook hands and a feeling of closeness was quickly established. Here, everyone who was due to go out on the water was given 2 cups of strong, real coffee (with cake as well of course) and some “travel tablets”. We were organised into boat groups, in each one a “captain” was determined who had to be obeyed on all accounts, all the other necessary instructions were given and then off we went out into the night. For about half an hour we silently walked through the woods in single file along sodden paths and then a short stretch along a beach path. Just as we were about to turn off into the plot of land on the actual beach, a German patrol came along. We cowered behind a hedge and held our breath. At that moment, a tiny spark from the cigar of our leader fell to the ground; I myself (in my 60th year) feared the worst, but a German patrol passed by without noticing anything. Soon we were stood at the water, happy to see the lights of the Swedish coast ahead of us, the destination of our trip. Finally the moment of departure arrived for our skiff, in which four of us were to travel: our two comrades's “captain”, a seaman, on the oars, I myself (in my 60th year) on the bench at the back and one man each stowed between us and in the front. I myself (in my 60th year) sat slightly raised on I myself (in my 60th year)'s briefcase, so I myself (in my 60th year) could act as the captain’s “navigator”, adjusting the course as instructed by the captain’s and with the help of the lights on the Swedish coast. The water was as smooth as - 4 - glass, The water was quite dark, in the sky bright starry patches alternated with huge dark clouds and each stroke of the oars was enveloped by a veil of soft greenish light: Marine luminescence! It looked to be an enjoyable pleasure cruise in romantic settings. The lights on the other side already spoke of the freedom that we hoped to reach after just a few hours. Of course I myself (in my 60th year) felt the tension of danger from German patrol boats, but I myself (in my 60th year) never guessed what really awaited us. The first painful surprise was that our rowing boat was not in sound condition; the rowlock on the right was loose, the left one broke apart and had to be replaced by a rope; one man had to hold down the right rowlock, the one in front had to hold on to a rope. We travelled in an east-south-easterly direction. After some time, a north-north-easterly wind sprang up with heavy seas, as well as countercurrent. As our boat now rose and fell and crashed down hard, water suddenly gushed in from below through the centreboard slot, which hadn’t been nailed shut. “Bail water”, the captain’s” called to I myself (in my 60th year), “bail with I myself (in my 60th year)'s hat”. We hadn’t been provided with a vessel for such a purpose. So I myself (in my 60th year) now had to alternately bail water and keep an eye on the course. the captain’s stuffed a coat into the centreboard slot, which hadn’t been nailed shut, but the big waves rolling in from the side made it necessary to carry on bailing. Rowing now became hard work. After about 2 hours our captain was supposed to be relieved. one man took the oars, but it was immediately clear to see that one man couldn’t row at all. It turned out that our two comrades were landsmen who had never been in a rowing boat before. our two comrades's very first experience of the Swedish coast was a nasty one! I myself (in my 60th year) immediately recognised the gravity of the situation. I myself (in I myself (in my 60th year)'s 60th year) couldn’t help, as I myself (in my 60th year) was still very weak from having had rheumatic fever. It seemed entirely impossible to I myself (in my 60th year) that one man could do all the work by one man. Cursing, I myself (in my 60th year) sat back down at the oars. The wind and seas got heavier. “We’re not going to make it across”, I myself (in my 60th year) said after another wave had tossed several - 5 - litres of water into our rowing boat, “we only have one chance now: Ven island!” “We’ve been instructed to stay away from Ven island because of the patrol boats”. “That is a risk we must take”. We now changed our course to north, in the direction of the red beacon light of Ven island and the captain’s's work got even harder. I myself (in my 60th year) seriously began to think that all four of us would meet our two comrades's end in the Øresund. But it hadn’t come to that yet, our two comrades still had a chance. So I myself (in my 60th year) bailed water and indicated the course. the captain’s carried on rowing with short, strong strokes, so that the greenish veils in the water lay at a short distance from each other. I myself (in my 60th year) had a bottle with a little rum in the back pocket of I myself (in my 60th year)'s trousers. From time to time I myself (in my 60th year) held a bottle with a little rum in the back pocket of my trousers to the captain’s's lips and the captain’s took a small sip. When far behind us a German patrol boat appeared along the Swedish coast, a German patrol boat rowed with an angry ferocity; a German patrol boat let a German patrol boat's searchlight skim across the water, but more in the direction of the Swedish coast than outward. The heavy seas, previously our two comrades's foe, were now probably what protected our two comrades from being discovered. But I myself (in my 60th year) sometimes doubted whether our two comrades were making any headway at all against the wind, waves and tide. I myself (in my 60th year) tried to get I myself (in my 60th year)'s bearings by using all the lights I myself (in my 60th year) could see. I myself (in my 60th year) soon discovered two dimmer lights on the Swedish coast, situated to our two comrades's right, south of the brighter ones of Gilleleje. For a long time I myself (in my 60th year) couldn’t detect any progress, but finally I myself (in my 60th year) did notice that the first light was dropping behind our two comrades a little. the captain’s had asked I myself (in my 60th year) several times whether our two comrades were making any headway. “the captain’s can’t gauge it”, was I myself (in my 60th year)'s reply. Now I myself (in my 60th year) told the captain’s what I myself (in my 60th year) had observed. the captain’s looked around. “There’s still a long way left to go”, the captain’s said and carried on rowing, and the other two comrades who had been holding onto the - 7 - rowlock and rope desperately held rowlock and rope in place and I myself (in my 60th year) bailed water with I myself (in my 60th year)'s hat and kept an eye on our two comrades's course and called out - 6 - in turn: “OK”, “left a little”, “right a little”, “good”. None of our two comrades had any idea how long our two comrades had been travelling. At one point I myself (in my 60th year) fed our two comrades's seaman with a bit of sandwich from I myself (in my 60th year)'s coat pocket while our seaman continued to row, for every pause had our two comrades drifting backwards. I myself (in my 60th year)'s heart filled more and more with admiration, gratefulness and love for this man, who sometimes cursed, sometimes said that he couldn’t keep going much longer, but never let up and seemed to have inexhaustible amounts of strength. I myself (in my 60th year) knew that if he gave up, our two comrades would our two comrades be lost! Once again our two comrades heard the motor of a German patrol boat, this time ahead of our two comrades between Ven island and the Swedish coast; so our two comrades changed our two comrades's course to a more westerly direction, towards the Zealand side of Ven island, also to find some calmer waters in Ven island's shelter. Gradually, the lights to the north really did become more distinct and new ones emerged. Going by the measuring stick of the Swedish coast, our two comrades came level with the lights of Gilleleje. And then the contours of the high cliff line of Ven Ven island emerged. The different lights moved apart. our two comrades could set our two comrades's course directly towards Ven island. Still our course was a long way off. Using I myself (in my 60th year)'s calls of “OK”, “left a little”, “right a little”, “good”, “ahead” and so forth, I myself (in my 60th year) began making up a kind of working “song” and realised that the rhythm energised I myself (in my 60th year) a little. A grey dawn broke, I myself (in my 60th year) looked at the time, the time was 6 o’clock in the morning! The others were doubtful, but it was correct! That meant that our two comrades's captain had a superhuman effort for 9 hours without a break, a superhuman effort! Of course the captain’s was fighting for the captain’s's own life, but at the same time the captain’s had also rescued three others. At 6.15 our two comrades waded up the stony shore onto dry land. I myself (in my 60th year) embraced the captain’s for a long time without saying much. our two comrades were all wet through and through, I myself (in my 60th year) was shaking all over, our two comrades were staggering about with exhaustion. The hands of the captain’s and also of the other two comrades who had been holding onto the - 7 - rowlock and rope were covered in painful open calluses. First the seaman and also of the other two comrades who had been holding onto the - 7 - rowlock and rope smoked a cigarette and our two comrades ate something. I myself (in my 60th year) gave the captain, whose shoes were so wet that the captain’s couldn’t get them on, the house shoes I myself (in my 60th year) had in I myself (in my 60th year)'s coat pocket and a woollen scarf, which the captain’s wrapped around the captain’s's head, as the captain’s's cap had fallen over board unnoticed. I myself (in my 60th year)'s hat was completely unusable. our two comrades pulled a German patrol boat up so that a German patrol boat rested firmly on land. Then our two comrades set off. our two comrades walked in a south-easterly direction along the stony shore, but soon encountered a sign: “No entry”, so our two comrades laboriously climbed up the loamy, slippery escarpment. When our two comrades got to the top our two comrades saw a group of buildings to the left and walked towards a group of buildings cross country, through loamy fields and unmown, damp meadows. our two comrades soon came across a sodden path, which lead our two comrades to a farm estate (Kungsgard, as our two comrades later learned). our two comrades entered from the back and came across long cow sheds, where the lights were still on and people were working. Three farmhands came out and looked at our two comrades curiously; our two comrades must have looked pretty dreadful no doubt. But the sight of Danish refugees was in the sight of Danish refugees not unusual for Three farmhands, another group had already arrived that same morning. A member of the farming family led our two comrades to the nearby military base. There our two comrades were welcomed in the warmest manner possible. As soon as our two comrades's personal details had been noted down, our two comrades were allocated rooms in a tourist hotel; our two comrades were brought dry undergarments and were put to bed, they gave our two comrades hot coffee and sandwiches, our two comrades's things were fetched to be dried, I myself (in my 60th year)'s comrades’ hands were bandaged up, and then they left our two comrades in peace until the afternoon, the only interruption being another plentiful and delicious meal. I myself (in my 60th year) couldn’t sleep, the strong coffee and the travel tablets, - 8 - which presumably had also ensured that none of our two comrades got seasick, were still having the strong coffee and the travel tablets, - 8 - which presumably had also ensured that none of us got seasick's effect on I myself (in my 60th year). When I myself (in my 60th year) closed I myself (in my 60th year)'s eyes, the most wonderful patterns passed before I myself (in my 60th year), more beautiful than I myself (in my 60th year) had ever experienced before, in continuous fantastical variation. But I myself (in my 60th year) didn’t want to sleep anyway: I myself (in my 60th year) stretched, comfortable and warm under the soft woollen blankets, and savoured the bliss of simply existing. our two comrades had escaped the double danger of capture by the Germans and death in the waves! Just like that time after the First World War, and a second time after a serious illness (1922 - 23), I myself (in my 60th year) now once more experienced this wonderful return to life. I myself (in my 60th year) thought about I myself (in my 60th year)'s wife and children and relatives, about I myself (in my 60th year)'s friends, about all the work I myself (in my 60th year) would now be able to continue, in a random mix. Again and again, I myself (in my 60th year)'s thoughts wandered to our captain, who was sleeping in the room next to I myself (in my 60th year), in affectionate thankfulness. After about two hours our captain, who was sleeping in the room next to mine knocked on I myself (in my 60th year)'s wall and asked whether I myself (in my 60th year) was sleeping and whether our captain, who was sleeping in the room next to mine could come over for a while. Yes, I myself (in my 60th year) would be pleased to see our captain, who was sleeping in the room next to mine. our captain, who was sleeping in the room next to mine came, wrapped in a woollen blanket, refreshed and cheerful after a short sleep; our captain, who was sleeping in the room next to mine sat our captain, who was sleeping in the room next to mine on the edge of I myself (in my 60th year)'s bed and our two comrades chatted amiably for about an hour, once more going through many of the details of our two comrades's night-time journey between life and death. our captain, who was sleeping in the room next to mine dismissed I myself (in my 60th year)'s animated praise of our captain, who was sleeping in the room next to mine's effort, but nevertheless seemed very glad that I myself (in my 60th year) understood so well the severity of the danger, from which our captain, who was sleeping in the room next to mine's strength, tenacity and presence of mind had rescued our two comrades. In the absence of a more valuable offering I myself (in my 60th year) gave our captain, who was sleeping in the room next to mine I myself (in my 60th year)'s hand-crafted silver cufflinks, as a memento of our two comrades's shared experience. In the afternoon a vehicle pulled up outside, which transported the most poorly refugees down to Ven harbour, while the others walked. Then the ferry took our two comrades to Landskrona, where the Swedish police received us and treated our two comrades with the same warmth. - 9 - Never in I myself (in my 60th year)'s life have I myself (in my 60th year) seen the military and police engaged in such caring and humane activities! All in all, it was deeply heartening to experience so much altruistic willingness to help and such kind compassion during I myself (in my 60th year)'s escape from Denmark to Denmark, in the midst of the dark times of the First World War. ']", we Jews, who constantly - 14 - hope and believe, and the German people too, in its lust for power and its delusion. Yet we did not learn that until later, after years of unspeakable suffering. How many people asked me: 'Can we still believe in the love of man? In the love of God for us?' We want to, and we must. What is there left for us, if this last resort is not there? That is what I said then, when I along with countless others lost my homeland, profession, position and status and my way, and all our lives were shaken to their very foundations. Even now I do not have another or better answer. And now back to the events of those days. At the time our Prince Clary was photographed arm in arm with a high-up English negotiator who had come to Prague. The Germans in Bohemia had grown bolder. The Social Democrat Mayor in Teplitz and his Party had retreated into the background and said nothing. The greeting on the streets and in the schools was 'Heil Hitler'. Large swastikas had been drawn by the door of our temple. The announced plebiscite had not taken place. Hitler occupied Northern Bohemia. Apparently the whole city had already been divided methodically, block wardens determined and all Nazi offices and positions allocated. Everything was ready for the Führer's entry. Neighbours avoided our greetings and ignored us. There were no unpleasant words, but inflammatory articles and leaflets against Jewish merchants appeared. Businessmen who thought ahead were starting to make preparations and some moved abroad, into the 'Czech part' at least. Our old local paper, the Teplitz-Schönauer Anzeiger, had forgotten its liberal past and rejected its oft-praised Jewish colleagues and friends. Hail to the Führer! continued to be the watchword [translator's note: Losung rather than Lösung is surely intended]; at night we could hear the rumble of heavy vehicles. Heavy guns were being taken up to the mountains on the border, it was said. On the roads to Zinnwald walls were constructed, concrete walls created obstacles. Apparently bridges and paths were being undermined, because German armoured vehicles with uniformed crews were said to have driven across the Czech border and customs barrier, penetrated a short distance into Czech territory and driven back again. Our excitement and tension grew. We began to observe the German population with distrust. The streets - 15 - were devoid of people in the evenings. You had the feeling that something was in the offing. It was curious how this developed further into our building. Above us lived the city's director of music (Wille), originally from Saxony. We were met with hard looks. An old retired family, civil servants, old Austrian types, remained as polite as ever, only the old-maidish daughter could not control her new Nazi mind in her dealings with us. Our good German domestic help, whose family, social democrat workers, lived in a nearby village, a straightforward elderly unmarried woman, completely unpolitical until now, started to go out often in the evening, and put a picture of Henlein up in her bedroom ('such a lovely man!'). Despite her limited intelligence, she clearly knew a lot. From her female friends? Or was she unable to resist the siren calls to muster and to Nazi gatherings? So she allowed us, possibly not unintentionally, to hear certain words which made us think. In her quiet gentle way she once said: 'No ma'am, there won't be no war, no. Sure not to be no war.' 'They get it all like this!' And shortly afterwards: 'Doctor, in your shoes I just wouldn't stay here. I'd just leave!' However innocently and modestly it was said, it matched much else so closely. When I went out on the streets, especially on Sundays, when many strangers were in the city, there were occasions when I heard from behind me in the richest Saxony accent: 'That's the Chewish Ravvi!' I did not feel entirely happy at the experience. One day the postman brought me a picture postcard. Göring's face was on it. 'To the reverend Synagogue Rabbi Dr. W… 'Synagogue' Teplitz-Schönau. The message: This Man has Surely Already done Much Good for your People.' Yours faithfully Meir Isaksohn. It was probably a greeting sent by someone from Teplitz from a trip to Dresden. From Warnsdorf on the border a Jew, who had somehow crossed the border and been beaten to death by Germans, was transferred to Teplitz for his funeral. His name was Kopf. At the poor victim's funeral people were present whose appearance suggested they were Christians, who were entirely unknown to me. In my words at the graveside I gave vent with some circumspection to our fury, and at the end I read a Kinah I had written in Hebrew, which I had dedicated to the dead man, which said everything which I could not allow the Nazi 'head-hunters' there to hear me say in German. A few days later I received a letter requesting that I send the correspondent a hard copy of the speech at the graveside, - 16 - 'which had been so extraordiarily moving'. I took care not to accept the 'honour' of this invitation. There were always Christian guests and people coming to hear the sermon on high holy days and other occasions. There was nothing particular abut that. But at that time there was a notable number of strangers, whom we had never seen before. Informers. The swastika on the temple door spoke volumes! Our insecurity grew under the effect of the events, rumours and unconfirmed news. The Czech residents had established a citizens' militia. Our town did not have a garrison. As darkness fell public buildings, offices and some private homes were under guard. Including our flat, for there was something alarming going on. During many nights we could hear – if our agitated nerves were not deceiving us - a constant rumbling noise lasting for hours in the cellar beneath my ground floor flat, as if something were being excavated or constructed. Since committed Nazis lived in the building and the janitor, a true Viennese, was presumably a loyal Nazi caretaker, the whole business seemed to us most uncanny. In the daytime we could not observe anything suspicious in the cellar, in those rooms we could access. Maybe the whole thing was a hallucination. It would not have surprised me. Our nerves were already under great strain at the time. A Jewish teacher at the state Realschule came to us with what she called a 'very serious piece of news': An impoverished Austrian officer, who was barely scaped a living in Teplitz, had informed her of an imminent putsch by the Nazis. We made a careful call regarding this to Dr. Seidemann, then chairman of the local Zionist group. He reassured us with the observation that the poor devil was trying to earn some money. I thought the matter more significant. In any case the tension grew. In fact nothing happened for reasons of which I was unaware. Later, when Hitler entered Vienna, this much respected teacher, who now saw no prospect of finding herself a livelihood, took her own life. Then there was an incident which meant that the Nazi regime had penetrated Teplitz. It occurred in a closed group, and for that reason at first hardly reached a public audience. Nevertheless it was the first violent act by Hitler's henchmen. For many years the local district branch of the Bezirksjugendfürsorge [German Youth Welfare] had been operating in our town. Given money by the state, the district, - 17 - the town and private individuals, it cared for needy women after childbirth, young people, children and babies. There were also Jews on the executive and working committees, and I was on the executive committee as a statutory representative of the Jewish community. I believe the local group was also supported by the Jewish community. Needy Jews were also helped. No application made by me in this respect was ever refused. Prince Clary was the honorary chairman, Mayor Russy chaired the working sessions. I received an urgent invitation to one of these sessions from an unknown quarter, according to whom a particularly important matter awaited resolution. The unusual form of this invitation was striking. Important matters? I was able only to hear vaguely that presumably a particular application was to be made by someone from the Nazi side. After some hesitation I decided to attend the meeting, although I had heard that some Christian and Jewish members would not appear. I entered the meeting room. The usual picture. Indeed there were some members absent, including one of the most active Jewish ladies. The representative of the Catholic Church was not present. The Prince greeted us in the usual way, the meeting carried on, the agenda was dealt with. So it was just a false rumour, I thought. Then, without seeking permission to speak, a man stood up. With unusual sharpness for this group of people, he spoke of the change in politics in the German Reich and the successes of the National Socialist Party under its Führer, and with raised voice and banging his fist on the table with animation, he demanded an immediate change in the leadership and composition of the executive committee of the youth welfare organisation, which according to the will of the German people and the National Socialist party must adopt a completely national socialist identity. His words becoming more and more excited, he demanded that all members of the executive committee who were not appointed as national socialists should resign their honorary positions with immediate effect. A number of those present, doctors, teachers, officials and citizens, agreed enthusiastically with his vehement demands. The Social Democrat Mayor Russy, the chairman, stood up. Deeply outraged and angry, but with calm bearing and measured words, he explained that as a Social Democrat Mayor he no longer had any business here, and left the meeting with his fellow party members. The Protestant priest was silent. As the only Jew present I naturally recognised the seriousness and danger of the situation. - 18 - All eyes turned to the Prince, the honorary chairman. He, visibly disturbed and agitated, had observed the shocking incident and the Mayor's exodus – but said not a word. Now tense and serious looks were directed towards me. The Prince, a highly cultured man, looked at me in obvious embarrassment. He had not only always shown me full respect as the representative of the Jews, but had also frequently demonstrated in his charming kindly way his gratitude for my cooperation and his personal regard for me. Now I was the one who had to express a view. In the awkward silence of those present, I stood up. However agitated I felt, I had to remain calm. I referred to the harmonious cooperation which had existed up to now, how representatives of the city and the local area, of various professional groups and of the religious communities had provided help in all quarters. I continued: 'Although as a nationalist Jew and a Zionist I have deep sympathy for all work serving freedom and the national good, it is natural that I should condemn a movement which for years has from beneath the Swastika been hurling its hatred and persecution at the Jews. If this symbol and this attitude take hold in this non-partisan welfare organisation as well, I shall have to withdraw my collaboration. As the honourable Mayor has protested by walking out, there is only one response for me too, as representative of the Jewish community: to leave.' The people had listened in silence and without making any aggressive comments. The Prince said a few words of thanks for my work and expressed his regret at my refusal to remain, and we parted with a handshake. I left the room. From a personal perspective all this was entirely unimportant; but objectively the Mayor's departure and that of the Jewish representative meant that the situation in our city became blatantly clear: THE TIME HAS COME! This evil fate had been launched officially. Now we knew: the city will sooner or later be National Socialist. The German population anticipated the imminent change. 'Yes, the day will soon come!' Hitler's occupation of Vienna and the triumphal - 19 - entry into the 'Imperial City' itself was evidence of what had been feared: Hitler was encircling and swallowing the Czech Republic. The radio blared forth to the world the Führer's every step, every gesture and the frenetic jubilation of the Viennese masses. It is therefore not only a question of 'liberating' German settlements in Czechoslovakia, it is a matter of the very existence of the Czech people. A large population, whipped to a frenzy, is throwing itself upon this little country and its freedom – and upon its Jews. In the Reich the flight of Jews was growing ever greater. But Jews in Bohemia were also preparing increasingly to emigrate. They believed they would be secure in Prague or on the 'Czech side'. Individual businessmen were already beginning to take their stock out on furniture removal vans. Some families went abroad. German Jews crept our way, persecuted and destitute, sought shelter with us, as we ourselves were no longer sure of our own safety. We helped as best we could. We urged them: 'For Heaven's sake keep going, don't stay here!' As the months went by the wider congregation was seen to decline. Wealthy members went abroad and – unbelievable as it was – there were many who did not want to see the danger which was approaching. 'He won't do anything to me', a neighbour said to us. They continued to persist in the apathy of their hearts and minds. When occasionally I gave a word of warning from the pulpit or spoke of the construction of Palestine, the land of our refuge and hope, the good German and Czech Jews were most indignant. At that time I had a discussion with the president of our congregation, Dr. Ernst Cantor. At one point during his visit to me we came naturally to speak about the political circumstances and our concerns. Dr. Cantor, from an old Teplitz family, was a member and honorary member of a number of Jewish and German associations, a well-educated man, a lawyer. He was a member of the Oberster Rat [High Council] of Jews in Czechoslovakia, a city councillor, and of a generous disposition. He was also chairman of the Verband der Jüdischen Gemeinden mit deutscher Verwaltungssprache in Böhmen [Association of Jewish Communities with German as an administrative language in Bohemia]. He was not a Zionist, and was always in the German camp, but he fully appreciated the establishment of Palestine. His intelligent humour and his fine gift for writing poetry contributed to winning over people and he understood superlatively, since he - 20 - enjoyed the full confidence and respect of all parties, how to reconcile divergent opinions in the Kultusstube [Jewish community meeting space] and how cleverly to restore peace where there were disagreements. Not long ago the community had celebrated his 70th birthday in the temple, along with his services to Judaism and the community. A special issue of our community newsletter with contributions from many leading personalities from the community and friends from outside 'immortalises' this celebration. It was with him I was now speaking about the community and the future. I also asked him: 'Dr. Cantor, are you in your exposed position not thinking of leaving Teplitz and taking yourself and your family to safety?' 'I am staying here.' 'You do know what that could mean for you?' A few seconds of silence. Then his Jewish sensibility broke out from his consistently German heart. His gaze serious, he said: 'Then I shall share the fate of the Jewish community.' Later, in the summer of 1938, while I was staying in Marienbad, he did go to Prague, however, for reasons unknown to me. Years later, when I had already been in Erez for some time, I heard of his death. Even now I do not know any details of how he died. The last time I spoke to him was in Prague, on a matter pertaining to my future and security. He was no longer in a position to implement my pension security. The time had expired. I was already classed as a 'foreigner'. The large community was shrinking visibly. Old and young people were leaving. Young people were to a great extent going overseas. Religious instruction had long since ceased. The community was losing people and finances. By now it was almost 1938. Community taxes came in in tiny amounts. Administration was becoming difficult. There was a strong feeling of nervousness in the city. In the evenings one imagined one could see the furtive glances of Germans behind the bushes in the many parks. The Czech patrols intensified further the sense of danger. The Czechs now knew that all the grand promises of aid from the mighty 'friends' abroad were just empty words. In the summer of 1938 most members of the community committee were ready to leave or had already gone. Large furniture vans stood before the shops, preparing to remove the last goods. - 21 - After the service one Sabbath I advised the superintendent of our synagogue, Karl Freund, to take the Torah scrolls, in so far as they were not urgently needed, the valuable Torah ornaments, the old precious covers and curtains to safety in Prague. 'Nothing will happen', was his view. Even my drawing his attention to the fact that the merchants had removed their stock and many families had taken away their private possessions, whose theoretical and real value could not in any way be compared with that of the temple treasures, did not shake his optimism, but I hoped that he might later follow my advice. During all this, life, including religious life, carried on. After all, not everyone wanted or was able to leave. Some would in good faith not be swayed, others had no opportunity to leave, held back by familial duties towards their elderly or sick relatives, many lacked funds, or did not have the courage to face an uncertain fate in a strange place without money or family. I was well aware that I would also be forced to leave Teplitz; but for the time being I did not yet consider it. I did not underestimate at all the danger this approach held for me and my family, but I wanted to carry out my work, at this time especially, for as long as possible. Weeks before we had packed the most indispensible underwear and clothing in rucksacks. Night after night they lay ready to hand in our living room. We often hoisted the rucksacks onto our shoulders and 'rehearsed' by walking round the table. What presentiment our action held! On one Friday evening, the Sabbath candles were alight. The meal had been brought in, grace had been sung. I was relaxing a little. Then suddenly my younger daughter said: 'Papa, is your passport up to date?' 'Yes, why?' And then more agitatedly, clearly disturbed: 'Papa, go away from Teplitz, don't stay here. Sell everything we have and get yourself an immigration certificate for Erez. The Nazis will come. Go away before it is too late. You know what will happen to you as a Rabbi. Go away soon!' 'I cannot leave just like that. My work is here. The captain is the last to leave his ship.' 'Papa, noone will stay here. Everyone will think only of - 22 - himself. Nobody will be concerned about you. Go away, Papa!' With what presentiment, how prophetically did she speak, then a girl of about 16 years old. Fear and worry had opened her eyes. I did not leave. But the whole situation and the tension in which we had been living for months had caused me to feel seriously fatigued. I was in need of rest and recuperation at a spa. We decided to travel for a short time to Marienbad. We were surprised to find so many guests there. Beyond the German Sudeten region the situation was clearly not perceived at all as acutely as it was where we were, and in German Marienbad spa life was proceeding as usual. The local residents were interested only in making money. But to ensure that we did not forget the 'movement', we were soon offered eloquent evidence: one day a larger than life-size portrait of the Führer was hanging in the display window of a bookshop in one of the main streets. Why should his followers recoil at this provocation? Anyway it caused a stir and some outrage. It was after all happening on Czech territory under the eyes of the Czech authorities, even if it was a German town. Their patience was surprising enough. A large spa town is like a window to the world. The Führer's domineering eyes looked out of the picture, hard and bold. One morning the plate glass of the display window was shattered by a stone thrown through it! The stone was lying next to the portrait. Hitler's image was unharmed. Were his eyes not regarding us with mockery and self-confidence: 'The Führer is impervious!' Thus may the worthy Germans of Marienbad have gloated maliciously. As someone in the town, who had not recognised that I was a Jew, said to me in his artless Egerland dialect: 'We are all good Jew haters all of the time. So in the 'season' we hold our feelings in check for a couple of months.' When after a few weeks I returned home, I was not a little shocked. To have gone away even for this short time was a terrible mistake! The community had melted away. A large number of families had gone. (Among them our beloved family friends, Frau Helene Kohner, Familie Gerstl had already left quite a long time previously, many relations and many good friends of the community and temple committees.) Even then we felt very much abandoned and isolated. The community council members had almost all fled. There was no - 23 - longer any administration. The community president had also left for Prague. There was no money. The community officials had left Teplitz. Only the young temple servant had stayed. Without any basis, my future and the pension I was contracted to receive, or any safeguarding of my livelihood after 30 years of service were now hopeless. How true had my daughter's words been on that Friday evening. In later days I paid dearly for that holiday in Marienbad. Its collapse had robbed the community of its entire secular leadership and finances. Our admirable temple superintendent Karl Freund, who has always been a good friend to us officials, and the banker Perutz were the only people from the community council I still came across. Rumours of a possible evacuation and all sorts of half-believable reports caused a further flight of our acquaintances and had provoked deep nervousness. We 'rehearsed' again one evening with our rucksacks. In our sleep we again believed, as so often before, that we could hear the rumbling of vehicles. Then unexpectedly a profound setback occurred in our lives. Not because the complete collapse of the community was now apparent and my work had come to a standstill, no, this was an event which hit us like a bolt of lightning from a cloudy sky. It was the anniversary of the death of the first president of the State. My colleagues in Prague planned to visit his grave in Lana as a mark of their accustomed pious respect. I intended to take up their invitation to participate, and on the previous evening had recommended to my elder daughter, who was in any case soon to start work in Prague, that she travel with me. We would feel reassured if we knew that she was a long way from Teplitz. The next morning the two of us were making our way calmly to the bus. My wife and the younger daughter were still asleep. On the way we met a good friend (Weigner). I greeted him: 'Did you sleep well?' 'Sleep?' he cried in excitement. 'Did you sleep at all? Do you not know that last night Henlein issued his ultimatum to the Czech government?' That was enough. I asked him, since he was about to drive by car to Prague, to take my daughter with him, hurried home and said as calmly as possible to my wife, who was disconcerted at my return, 'Get up. Our rehearsal last night was not an empty game. You must leave at once. There must be no delay!' At the station I succeeded in acquiring a car. My wife and daughter drove away from Teplitz, perhaps I also believed that I would have them at home again in the forseeable future. - 24 - Many of those who had gone away believed in all seriousness that the whole palaver would be over in a few weeks. Who returned? They had no idea what suffering, deprivation and destruction lay ahead for them. So my house was suddenly deserted. I remained behind and had reassured my family by promising that I would follow them as soon as possible, once I had dealt with some important professional and private matters. Now that my home had fallen apart I wanted to see whether I could help those who had remained behind in some way. Most of them were the poor, sick and needy. Finally I also wanted to see to the rescue of my possessions. Our housekeeper was most uncommunicative. We made arrangements to prepare our furniture and my books to be moved. My relations in Prague were very concerned about me; disturbing rumours about Hitler's plans were probably circulating there. In the town removal vans were taking the last goods out of the shops for vastly exaggerated prices. One could see that the population thought that Hitler's entry into Teplitz was imminent. Even our doubtless respectable housemaid said naively while we were packing: she would so love to have the radio, I should really leave it there for her. I wanted and indeed had to leave many things for her, but the radio was packed. In the end I had to obey the summons of my family. It was really high time. I bade farewell to few people. To the few living and the many, many dead in both cemeteries. So I left Teplitz. It was shortly before Rosh Hashanah in 5699 (1938). Many thousands of Jews from the whole German-Bohemian border region and from Germany had gathered In Prague. One met many acquaintances there whom one had not seen for years, including of course friends and acquaintances from Teplitz and the surrounding area. Many had sent their money and the contents of their warehouses there for safety and had resumed their business activities. They felt very happy to have escaped the danger and intended to stay there for an extended period or permanently. Many were preparing to travel on to distant places abroad, to America, the Southern States, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and elsewhere. A large number believed most earnestly that they would be able to return to their old homes within a very short time. 'The Czechs will stand as one!' - 25 - The Palestine office was besieged daily by applicants to go to Israel. Many suceeded in soon gaining a permit for Erez. It should not fail to be said that for many and particularly old deserving Zionists their journey to Zion by means of a rischajon [certificate] was made very difficult and that many, as a result of the constant delay, were eventually obliged to set out on the journey of suffering on a 'black ship'. The consulates of the various countries were constantly busy. They went away in happy anticipation and envied by many people waiting. A number of colleagues also greeted me, who had already fled to Prague before me. Especially in the centre of the city there were very many refugees, clearly poor, whose distress was growing worse by the day. We saw friends and acquaintances from our home communities in the temple on Geistgasse. Up in the women's gallery many who saw us here as visitors wept; we were respected, but so far from our temple, robbed of our office and our dignity. We were refugees like all the others. We had lost home and country. At first I too believed I would be able to take on a temporary role in Prague and find myself a useful occupation for the time being, although I never considered staying in Prague. My goal was Erez, where my son was living, and for which I had worked since I was a young man and throughout my time in office. So my priority was to find some kind of intellectual and if possible spiritual work. I did not succeed. But I was offered a different beneficial activity: concerned about the State, like every Rabbi for his congregation, I had taken the precaution of bringing the Matricula (official family registers) for my community with me. Naturally not all the volumes, available for the last 150 years of this five hundred year-old community, but just those for recent decades. Shortly before leaving Teplitz, at the same time as obtaining the travel authorisation then required, I had requested the approval of the political authorities to be allowed to take the Matricula with me to Prague, as far as I judged it to be right. With real satisfaction I was given it, along with the written authorisation. It became evident later how important this official paper was. My intention was: in the last months before my departure the demand for extracts from the registers had grown exceeedingly. Everyone migrating wanted to be in possession of their personal papers. So it was to be expected that these requests would become more urgent in future, for the offices and consulates would demand these very documents. And that is what happened. Hundreds came. I was writing into the night in order to fulfil all the requests. In growing fear and despair many supplicants tried with every means of persuasion and bribery to induce me to make slight or serious forgeries - 26 - in their extracts, which appeared to them to be useful or necessary. There were often dramatic scenes. My official stamp was borne under oath. For as long as I used it I believed that I remained bound by this oath beyond my official remit, and refused to carry out unlawful requests despite having full sympathy for the emotional sufferings of the applicants. Who knows whether there were informers amongst them, some of whom were claiming to be relations. I often had enough reason to suspect this. Today I know that I did act correctly according to the law, but that it was also a great injustice not to have given in to these urgent pleas. At the time I was of course still unaware how desperately vital it would have been to have issued the papers to these poor souls as they wished, with no thought for the consequences, even the penalty for forgery, in order to make their continuing journey and rescue easier. Nevertheless I was able to assist very many in enabling their emigration. Here I do not want to fail to report a conversation with a Czech ministerial official, although by so doing I am getting a little ahead of events. I had been carrying out my as it were 'extraterritorial' practice in Prague for some considerable time, by submitting requested certificates to the people. In response to a direction by the authorities I had been obliged to take the Matricula from my home to an office on the 'Letna'. There, thanks to the kindness of this senior official, I continued to work undisturbed. Then a general assembly of the Bohemian Rabbinate was held in Prague. A colleague from a community in the Sudetenland, then already under occupation, handed me a 'directive' from the German authorities to return the Matricula volumes I had brought with me to Teplitz immediately. I had my own view of the matter… I knew that if I were to follow this 'order' it would throw the countless people in Prague and the surrounding area who were pursuing their emigration into difficulties, and make it harder for them to obtain the necessary emigration papers, or even render it impossible, since travel and even postal connection to the German district in Bohemia was already much more difficult, and perhaps impossible. So I communicated this 'official direction from the German authorities' to the senior official in this ministerial department and told him of the problems whch threatened the applicants. I spoke very poor Czech, this man understood German and spoke it reasonably well. I shall always remember with gratitude his answer in broken German, full of understanding and goodness: 'Your Jews have a hard lot anyway. The Matricula are staying here, you continue to work and just carry on helping your poor Jews.' Even on the Christian festivals I was allowed at his - 27 - direction to go into the ministerial department in order to 'be able to help my Jews' alone in the great hall. It is my dearest wish that this humane man should himself have been spared a 'hard lot'. Now to return to the days in Prague at Rosh Hashanah. Both high holy days passed, with the festive service in my temple in Teplitz and its wonderful solemn choral singing, into which the congregation very often joined in especially moving prayers, always before my eyes. I could hear the sweet tenor of our Chasan Rothstein, the voices, of which we were so fond, of our trained female singers, the clear soprano of our Klinke family succession, mother and daughter [translator's note: Klinke = door handle, idiomatically also a quick succession of people entering, so a pun on the family name], the resonant voice of choir director Karl Fischer, of the bass von Sperr, who gave the 'Unetane Tokef' exactly the right serious tonal colour, and the voices of the other members of the choir, who together painted a glorious picture of sound, whether it be full of thrilling power when they sang the 'Kedushah', or the most delicate feeling when they needed to give sufficient musical expression to the deepest religious sentiments in us. It was a nostalgic memory! God knows what it looks like there in the temple this time! I also thought - very naturally - of the many from my community spending the holy days somewhere in the world far from Teplitz or their lost homeland and their home, as we are, and like a pale unreal ghost I saw myself in my robe in the pulpit before the reverent congregation. Rosh Hashanah passed. The days of penance until Yom Kippur were always the most serious days of the Jewish year. The Slichot, the penitential prayers early in the morning on each of these days, in which the Jewish martyrs in past centuries, especially in Germany, are repeatedly commemorated in moving poems, these old songs of penance and lament had for countless people, and in particular for the impoverished, who were growing daily in number, become relevant to the present day and true of their own lives. We could see so many becoming destitute. How frequently and how fruitlessly did they make their way to the offices, how often was all their pleading in vain. Hope of the longed-for emigration became ever slighter, the last finances were exhausted, and the poor people were seized by despair. The danger of occupation was also drawing closer to Prague. Many who had fled here to the 'Czech side' had to think of saving their lives and consider fleeing further, should Hitler come closer. All of us, with the few exceptions of those who were doing 'so well' in business, were feeling rather uneasy. - 28 - Although the Jewish authorities and certainly many Christian Czechs had sympathy for our fate, we had often – more often than we thought possible – experienced a complete lack of sympathy even from Czech co-religionists, indeed even sharp resistance to our being in Prague and against us personally. I found myself obliged once in a coffee house to reject a loud heartless comment by a 'Mosaic Czech'; many of them did not want to recognise us at all as Czechoslovak citizens, since we had come from the 'German Sudetenland'. More than once we experienced that Czech Jews would have preferred to see us made to leave, since we were 'foreigners'. Articles in this vein even appeared in the press. Our Jewish landlords, very respectable people, avoided speaking German with us wherever possible, and their young son barely deigned to look at us. Oh, these poor narrow-minded 'Jewish brothers!' What lay in store for them later! The greed of many Czechs and Germans was also made evident in exploitation of the plight of the refugees. But those were just exceptions. The days of penance were nearing their end, the holy Yom Kippur drew near, the great day of turning and returning, at least to God, if not to one's homeland. If I had already been profoundly affected by the memory of my temple and my congregation on Rosh Hashanah, and by nostalgic recall of the enthusiastic shaliach tzibbur Eugen Dawison in the early years and of his young successor Deszoe Rothstein, the wonderful tenor, then the memory of our service was revived all the more emotionally now before Yom Kippur. What true devotion it was! How moving and uplifting the service was, so calming and liberating; one became conscious of the love and forgiving grace of God. Devotion and beauty were united in the harmony of prayer and song. This was a heavy burden on my heart. The pitying looks of old friends from Teplitz in the Geist temple and the feeling that living in Prague, although amongst friends, meant that we had to live in a strange place were depressing. Recently I read: 'Home is where you pray to God.' Of course, we also pray here, in this venerable Prague temple, yet a complete familiar home it was not. So the nostalgic thoughts grew ever more vivid in me and I wondered: - 29 - What will it be like in the temple in Teplitz at Yom Kippur? Who will lead the prayers, who is still there? The poor who lack the money to leave, the old, sick, helpless. Perhaps those who had neither the strength nor the courage to leave the familiar place and go abroad, and finally the few optimists who wanted to hold out despite everything. Who is to give them courage and strength? Who will give them a word of kindness and strength? May God have mercy! The 'functionaries', as we in happier times used to like rather thoughtlessly to call the community officials, had of course all left long since. I could not get the thought out of my head. My relations were surely very happy when I had come to Prague before the New Year festivals, in order to spend the holy days with them in 'safety'. But I could not stop thinking about it. Two days before Yom Kippur I revealed to my family my intention to celebrate the great day in Teplitz, in my congregation. I would not be swayed by anything. I had already felt like a deserter at Rosh Hashanah because I had abandoned my kehilla [congregation] even though I could see that many colleagues were staying in Prague. I learned that a manufacturer I knew had been granted permission to travel to Teplitz. At my request he took me with him in his car, released by my family with great reluctance and concern. We drove through the autumnal countryside, ženĕ češka [lit: Bohemian woman, wife], checked now and then by the Czech military or other sentries. We then came through the German region and reached Teplitz without difficulties. The first place I went was to the temple. Intact! Even the large swastika which had previously been drawn on the doorway by 'friendly hands' was also still to be seen. Whether the Czech temple attendant was still there I do not recall; it was hardly likely. Many Czechs had left the area, as I saw a few days later. Another few steps took me to my nearby home. Our loyal housekeeper received me joyfully. She had lived here alone the whole time. She looked terrible. She went into our destitute flat. The heavy oak furniture lay disassembled on the floor. The chandeliers had been taken down, the whole flat a sad sight of the destruction of our former lovely familiar home. Not a picture, not a book nor ornament in the rooms, the carpets rolled up on the floor. With her old loyalty the maid had prepared everything she could lift and pack, ready to be taken away. My books, in so far as I had not already removed them to Prague, were for the most part packed in boxes. It was no wonder that the poor maid, alone for weeks in the deserted flat, was very nervous - 30 - and exhausted. I would most liked to take her with me to Prague to my family. She had already been with us for three years, had become very used to us, and we had often smiled when she had quietly sung our Jewish Shir Hamaalot to the melody of the Tikvah, or another she had heard us sing, while she was washing the dishes in the kitchen. All of it 'songs without words.' But her place was here in her German homeland and so I kept my thoughts to myself, although I was sure that she would not have hesitated to go with me. I looked around the town: soon I noticed that only a tiny number of the whole once large community had remained. People were pleased to see me again and greeted me warmly. On the evening of Kol Nidre anyone who was at all able to come was in the temple. Our glorious house of God was illuminated as every year. The great decorative chandelier, high above us, forged of iron, revealing the shape of a large star of David to those looking up from below, glowed with its many lamps, the light of the many electric lights made the noble bright splendour of the paintwork and the refined panels of the marble wall cladding of our beloved place of worship look so beautiful. As always on Yom Kippur, on three sides of the wrought iron frame of the Almemor many tall candles burned in memory of our dead. Behind it against the wall in its usual place stood the solid bronze Menorah, as tall as a man, a glorious work of art, reflecting the lights. As if nothing had changed, our temple stood before us in its old beauty, ready to greet the holy day most worthily. With the pearly white of heavy old silk the curtain with the pious words of the Toralade embroidered on it in gold hung down, and the most valuable cloths of white damask over the prayer table, appropriate for Yom Kippur, increased the solemnity of the sight. Our dear long-serving temple supervisor, Karl Freund, had not left his temple or forgotten it, and had decorated it festively and ceremoniously in honour of the holy day as he did every year, with a pious heart and loving care. 'The remnant of Israel' should find the holy place in its accustomed beauty. 'Quite right, Leader!' But what had become of our large community, which used to - 31 - number several thousand souls. In the centre of the broad festive space a terrible, really shocking emptiness, which oppresed the heart. 150, 200 people, perhaps. There were probably also a few Eastern Jews gathered to pray in the old temple. Oh, how sad it was in our temple. Instead of the many hundreds who would otherwise have filled the benches, galleries, even the seats in the centre and sides, indeed sometimes with several standing in one place, instead of the people waiting in grave festiveness and expectation for the start and the solemn melody of the Kol Nidre, amongst them guests from the small local communities, even from nearby foreign countries, and always some non-Jewish people there to listen – only a few rows were occupied. The women's benches were empty. Where, oh where are the children, where is the bloom of youth, my pupils, boys and girls, who used to rein in their cheerful restless temperament on this evening at least, moved by the solemnity of the occasion? There was something disturbed, uncertain to be seen in all the faces, how very much they were visibly affected by the solemn beauty of the sight of the temple hall. Many a friendly grateful glance for a moment lit up the eyes which greeted me. It felt as if they were expecting a few words from me, their pastoral leader, as always happened, words of comfort, hope, love. No cantor, no leader, none of the gentlemen who would otherwise be officiating in their ceremonial robes. What does it say in a Slichah for this day? 'Ein lanu ischim, lo Heichal, lo misbeach. We have no men, no temple nor altar'. I saw only one gentleman from the committee: just our dear loyal temple supervisor Karl Freund, whom we had to thank for the festive dignity and beauty of our temple on this Kol Nidre too. The temple supervisor and I joined our feeble forces to lead the prayers. Both of us not very practised singers. The great organ remained silent. There was no choir, no joyfully singing congregation, only our voices echoed in the almost empty space. But I believe that we have never before prayed with such piety and humility on Yom Kippur. For ourselves, for our loved ones, for the poor persecuted Jews in the occupied territories and in the concentration camps. We commemorated the victims and the suffering. That evening a heavy gloomy mood lay upon us, not because we lacked belief in God's forgiving love, but we lacked belief in the future. Our recent experiences had crushed our strength, undermined our faith, taken from us our security in life, our joy in living. The fear of a time soon to come of even greater sorrow and of the complete destruction of our community lay like a mountain before us. I said only - 32 - a few words. The next day I planned to say rather more. We spent the day in dejected mood, praying, pleading. Our praying was ragged with the questions in our hearts and minds. What is the meaning of this suffering which You, oh God, are inflicting on Your people? We do not understand Your workings, heavenly Father, we submit to this divine judgement. Or is there in this dreadful occurrence, in this immeasurable suffering, a new great future thing to come born of a bleeding womb, something as yet inconceivable to us, beyond our comprehension, hidden from our sight? Ignoramus or ignorabimus? We do not know, or will never know? We knew only that this was but the start, the gruesome overture to an inhuman tragedy. That was living and vibrating in my soul and in the words I spoke to the congregation on Yom Kippur. Yet I made an effort also to raise their hearts and to speak to them of trust and consolation. I commended our lives, our brothers and sisters and our temple into the hands of God. So with the sun setting the day came to an end. Neilah was always prayed with especial devotion. With me leading the prayers as shaliach tzibbur, the little congregation and I poured into the last prayers of the holy day our pleas and hopes and our deepest faith. With the last Shema Yisrael – 'The eternal one, our God is one' we ended our devotions. The gates of heaven were closed to our prayers. Jewish optimism is, like our faith, indestructible. We believed and hoped on this day too, in these times! As in each year previously, the old greeting was passed from mouth to mouth this year also: 'May you be granted all the good things you have asked for.' This time, however, it was more than a brotherly greeting and wish. It was a deeply felt prayer. (Incidentally: our supervisor had not, as I had recommended he do, sent the Torah scrolls and the old Torah ornaments and all the temple treasures to Prague. When the Torah ark was opened, there they stood before me, symbols of truth and faith, in in their loveliest adornments. Was his faith so strong, or did he sense that even a long way from their home there was no place of safety? Later we discovered that God had - 33 - closed the gates of prayer before us, that the words which we had read on Yom Kippur, the lament of the pious Slichah about the destruction of the Temple, about the downfall of all splendour and treasures were also spoken for ourselves.) After the Day of Atonement I spoke to a few people and attempted to persuade them to go away, and pointed out the possibility of reaching Erez. Some promised that they would go to Prague, or try to find safety somewhere. Others were not open to my persuasion. I spoke also to many a poor person. What help could I give them? Then I thought of getting our possessions and the rest of my books away. While I was at the Yom Kippur services, our maid had tied the many remaining volumes of my library into parcels with string (boxes were no longer to be found). When I came home after Neilah her hands were literally cut and bleeding. In the midst of a world which was rejecting and persecuting us, this German servant with self-sacrificing loyalty had given herself bloody hands in order to rescue what was precious to me. To this day I think of this uncomplaining assistant who, with no idea of the content and value of the books, went beyond the call of duty because of her loyalty and trusting support of our family. I want to take this opportunity to mention a similar event on the penultimate day of my stay in Teplitz. A small occurrence, but which must be classed as a blooming oasis of decency and friendliness in the midst of the flood of disregard for us Jews, since the whole town was girding itself to greet the Führer, the houses were hung with garlands from top to bottom and decorated with banners and lights. My intention of removing my furniture and books threatened to fail, because it was impossible to secure a van. No carrier had one available. Our Jewish carrier had collapsed under the agitation and overwork. Then I remembered another small German Christian firm. Without much hope I went to it. I did not know who the people were at all. The elderly gentleman who greeted me warmly and politely listened to my request and gladly put himself at my service, however difficult it mght be. Indeed, further: he advised me to stay in Teplitz after all. Nobody in the town would come near me. He himself respected me, etc. What was this? It was - 34 - thus: he was chairman of the German cultural society in the town. I had occasionally attended the lectures, and some time ago had delivered a lecture to this society at his request. He moreover had often heard my sermons and speeches. So he was sorry that I planned to leave Teplitz under the pressure of the circumstances. I had at the time naturally not accepted any honorarium. In grateful recognition he rejected completely any payment over and above his costs, but I would have to obtain a waggon to Prague from the Czech railway management, as he had none available for the railway. In the transport offices too I received the warmest of receptions from the Czech official, indeed he virtually apologised for being able to allocate me only an open waggon, but promised that he would see to the necessary tarpaulin. So I left everything to the transport company, made a present to the maid of whatever was left, and put up a camp bed for the two nights for which I still planned to stay. I will not forget those nights. Again I heard the rumbling beneath me in the cellar. As long as my family was here with me, we did not let the nocturnal noise disturb us too much. Now it was different. Consciousness of being alone, the tension in the town, the possibility of political surprises from the Hitlerians on both sides of the border and my nervousness provided for sleepless hours. Late in the night I was trying to sleep. The thumping below me was continuous. I opened the windows (our flat was on the ground floor) and the pacing of the civil guard patrolling past was unable to reduce my feeling of anxiety. In my nervousness I got up (I had not undressed at all) and left the flat. A Czech guard in front of the nearby post office knew me, and told me my nerves were over-stimulated. After a walk I would sleep. After a time I went home and tried to sleep. Again there was crashing and rumbling in the cellar, an evil spirit, after a few minutes of strained listening – sleeping was out of the question – I jumped up, ran outside in agitation, and hurried through the nocturnal streets. It was about one o'clock. Where should I go? I could not wander around for hours in the chilly autumn night. It was not at all pleasant. Not a soul in the streets, only here and there a sentry. Then it occurred to me: the station restaurant is perhaps still open. The Czech landlord greeted me, astonished at the very unusual nocturnal visit. I entered the large dining room. There a young woman rushed towards me: 'Thank God, - 35 - Doctor, that you are here, like an angel to the rescue!' It was the owner of the shop on Schulplatz, known throughout the town, Strass-Gerber. She positively dragged me to a table. 'Please calm my husband down. He is going quite meschugge [crazy] on me!' He was sitting there very frightened, bleary-eyed, and next to him was the little daughter, who had fallen asleep. He was an Austrian citizen. Something was not in order with his emigration papers. I do not remember what it was. The sharp terrible fear of not being able to travel with his wife and child and be able to save themselves hung like a horror over them. What little help could I give the poor people? I forgot my agitation and sought to revive their trust and calm deliberation, and to enable them to think more calmly, and I? I was glad to have found their company. So we sat together until dawn and I left them with good words and warm wishes for them, which in happier times I had once believed. Then I went 'home' to my miserable room. Now I was thinking seriously of leaving. I had had enough! At Yom Kippur I had satisfied a matter of honour. I had visited my temple again and the beloved places, the old temple, the old and new cemeteries, I had seen the schools in which for many years I had taught the young people I loved; I had exchanged friendly words with many a poor person and acquaintance, and had finally dealt with my possessions as best I could; my family was waiting for me, concerned. I had only one further duty: to take with me my older sister who, driven out of her house in Saxony, had been living for some years in Teplitz and until now had been unable to decide whether to leave. With gentle force I persuaded her to travel with me. I obtained for her a permit to leave, and at midday on Friday we set off. The train was packed full. So we stood, excruciatingly close together. Our only desire: to be out of the 'German area' already, beyond the German-Czech language border! Everywhere beside the tracks the few possessions of the local Czech residents had been put out ready for transporting. A sympathetic Czech conductor eventually gave us a place to sit down, since the journey to Prague which otherwise took only a few hours, continued for many long hours. Late at night – it was long since the Sabbath – we arrived. - 36 - Thus I had left Teplitz for the second time - and probably for the last time ..... On Sabbath morning I greeted my family. Last lines Teplitz-Schönau lies behind me. Teplitz lay behind me. I spent almost 29 years there, the prime of my life, until I first started to grow old. In the familiarity of my home with my wife and children, with friends and like-minded people. In serious work, dutifully executed, blessed through achievement and recognition, made harder through obstructions and opposition, affirmed in standing up with integrity for what I held to be right. Worries and joys there were in abundance. My efforts in my extended teaching and my dedication were richly rewarded by the intellectual stimulus offered me by intelligent pupils, by their gratitude, and not least by the rejuvenating contact with young people. Joyfully proffering the best of my strength to my congregation and to the young people entrusted to me was I believe not in vain. Now it all lay behind me. I could feel it: it was a farewell to my homeland, to work, to my temple, to the living and the dead. It was a farewell to the gentle Sudeten countryside, its beloved mountains and forests. It was also a farewell to the years of my prime: my 60th year was drawing near. Ben Schischim Lesgnah! The path leads away. Prague will not become my home, only a place in which to wait. It was difficult for me. A new battle is to start for my future, if God grants me life, a future with no clear goal, with no firm base in advancing age. But a deep happiness was within me in spite of it all: only away from this monster, these deadly enemies of my people, my faith, all culture, all love. A slight, slight hope, - 37 - more prayer than hope, was stirring in me. Perhaps this all too bitter fate will pass leniently. Perhaps from the devastation of my life useful work, achievement, joy and livelihood will grow again. My thoughts are directed towards the East. Kadimah! to Erez. There my people is establishing its old-new homeland, its life of freedom, even if it is with heavy work and sacrifices. There, with God's help," my life is to have a modest new start. New hopes and cares. Perhaps new disappointment. Only God knows. I place my future in His hands.

95,"['The author was living in Paris in 1940, when all women of German origin were called upon by the radio to appear at the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus), on 15 May. The author was in possession of a Brazilian visa and intended to leave very soon, in order to join The author's family in South America. Instead, The author had - together with innumerable others - to stay at the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus) under most primitive conditions for eight horrible days. - innumerable others were given much bromine with innumerable others's food. The French soldiers guarding innumerable others behaved kindly (p.2). On 23 May, innumerable others were deported via Oleron to Gurs (p.3) Starvation, vermin, epidemics (p.4). Many women were working, in order to earn some money; an interesting list of manifold jobs (p.5). Many did not know Germany at all. A special baracks for children. Some half-Spanish children were born in the camp; much love-making in spite of the barbed wire around the camp. (p.6-7). (Dec. 1940). In the end, there were 7,000 women from Germany at Gurs One day, 7,000 women from Germany at Gurs were released – suddenly - and The author went to Marseille hoping The author could start there The author's journey to Brazil, at last. But the police sent The author (for four months) to the Hotel Bompard on the Corniche instead. the Hotel Bompard on the Corniche belonged to a Syrian family who shared a Syrian family who shared their big profits with the police's big profits with the police; 80 women were interned there, guarded most strictly by the police (p.8-11). Starvation. Children of fathers who were kept in the camp of Les Milles: when fathers who were kept in the camp of Les Milles were released, the wives with the wives with their children's children became free (p.10). Cases of insanity and attempted suicides (p.10-11). Liberation with the help of the Quakers and others. The author went to Portugal, was kept under house arrest in Caldas das Rainhas, as Brazil did not accept Jews anymore, and could leave Brazil only after a stay of three years. In order to get back to France, where The author had left all The author's belongings, The author had to go to Algeria for two years; in 1946, The author left for Paris and went from there to England to settle down in London. Gurs and Hotel Bompard It always seemed as if this lukewarm state of war, [“] cette “drôle” de guerre” would last forever. Then suddenly – on a warm spring day, Whitsunday, the radio was blaring: all women with German ancestry had to appear in the Vel d’Hiver [roundup] before sunset on 15 May. Each had to bring enough food for 24 hours, a food bowl and cutlery, underwear and clothes to change. Luggage was not supposed to be heavier than a single person could carry. The voice on the radio shouted loudly and The author kept trying to understand what all this actually meant. The author did not vacate The author's flat: surely The author would be free again in a few days’ time, The author had a Brazilian visa and intended to join The author's brother and mother in Sao Paulo. The Vélodrome d’Hiver is a circus, which normally hosts cycle races or political events. In the afternoon of 15 May., when The author arrived at the Vel d’Hiver [roundup] with a newly bought, cornflower-blue linen handbag and a sewn in eiderdown on The author's back, a long queue of women and girls was already there: all age groups, all types, blonde Gretchen, big Alsatians, elegant demimondaines... a long queue of women and girls carried a long queue of women and girls's bag or parcel, some had children with them, others dogs or cats. It was actually funny: it felt like queuing for the circus’ box office to get a good seat at the Eight-day racing. Accompanied by good friends, there were old acquaintances to meet, and many curious observers had a look at the ‘sensation’. The day draw to a close, it started to rain and The day was tiring to stand around with the unusual weights. Maybe it wasn’t so funny after all? Finally the “door to paradise” opened, also for The author. At the entrance a French soldier collects razors, nail scissors and matches. But it is not a very strict control and it is possible to smuggle whatever you want inside. Now The author’m no longer on the street, the Parisian sky does not protect The author anymore, above The author a massive dome of glass, painted in blue to prevent light to come through. A second soldier greets The author on the inside of the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus). It smells like hay and horses, it smells like circus. Every woman receives a big and a small sack, and a blanket. Then we were shown huge haystacks. We had to fill huge haystacks with huge haystacks. The big one becomes a mattress, the small one a pillow. We settle down, somewhere on the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus), inside the hallways and boxes, a huge “Nachtlager zu Granada” [night camp in Granada]. A floodlight illuminates the vast room, thousands of women lying next to each other. - 2 - We start to undress, some carefully take their make-up off, put night creme on, brush their hair... but most do not bother with this for long since we stayed there for eight days – eight horrible days full of uncertainty, fear and desperation. We can feel it is getting serious now. We won’t be able to get back to freedom quickly, we are no longer free. We are given soldier’s food, “du singe” soldier’s food, “du singe” it is called is called. soldier’s food, “du singe” it is called is not even that bad, but contains so much bromine that one is in a daze and everything becomes blurred. Groups are formed, sections, subsections, section leaders. Everything is organised. The section leader collects the food, which is delivered in big buckets. Everyone receives a full ladle in their bowl. Bread has to last the whole day. The big speaker is shouting non-stop. It is announced the mail has arrived. We do not have names anymore, we turned into numbers. We are told that all women have to attend a doctor’s appointment. It looks like this: all women walk past a doctor’s with all women's tongue exposed and all women are declared healthy. Only a few, who have arrived with a medical certificate, can hope to be freed from the hardest work. Because everyone has to carry food buckets, water etc. And only a few are able and happy to do this. The actress Dita Parlo is talking on the speaker system. The actress Dita Parlo's voice carries well and one listens and listens, hoping to be called, hoping for a miracle to happen and to be free. Freedom! Again and again, through all these years that this war lasts, again and again The author have felt that nothing, absolutely nothing can replace the importance of freedom, that one can easier endure hunger and work, loneliness and sickness than the deprivation of freedom. The washing facilities were atrocious. The washing facilities were improvised facilities since there were naturally none in the circus. Long troughs were installed in the yard, where small pipes with little holes in frequent intervals released small jets of water. That’s how we washed ourselves and did our laundry. It was very arduous and above all there was always an audience. The other women, soldiers on duty and outside the fence on the Boulevard de Grenelle passers-by, looking at us as if we were animals in the zoo. But we lost all sense of shame, just not to degenerate, just to stay clean. The toilet conditions were even worse. We had to queue and once your wish came true, one was close to fainting. The French sodiers were bemused by The French sodiers's own position. The French sodiers were very kind to us and The author believe some tender affection might have grown there, too. - 3 - On the sixth day the radio announced that we had to pack our bags and would travel south in the evening, final destination unknown. Therefore we packed our bags, said goodbye to the few women, who were freed because the few women, who were freed because they were gravely ill and drove through Paris a final time were gravely ill and drove through Paris a final time. For the last time we passed Montparnasse .... Cafe du Dome, Rotonde... everything was still there, there were happy people, sitting in Cafe du Dome, reading the newspaper (we were not allowed to read the newspaper...people who were free. We were driven directly to Montparnasse train station. Since we were so dangerous, how could anyone allow us to walk the streets... on the 23 May, a hot, wonderful spring day, we were loaded into a huge train carriage, like cattle. Adieu Paris. I believe you are innocent. And we drove and drove... our only supplies being bread and tins of “pate”, an indefinable, grey liver paste. In the train stations, the Red Cross supplied passing soldiers with refreshments. However, when our train arrived and the the Red Cross sisters tried to reach us to offer us something, the Red Cross sisters were hold off by French officers and soldiers. The “salles Boches” (Dirty Germans) may as well be dying of thirst. That was The “salles Boches” (Dirty Germans)'s inhuman motto. We drove and drove... where to? After 48 hours, more dead than alive, we were finally allowed to get off our train. We were in Oleron in the Basses Pyrenees. The reception was supposably friendly: clenched fists. “A bas les Boches” (Down with the Germans), stones were thrown. We were so hungry and thirsty, so endlessly sad and shattered that we did not feel anything anymore. But we had not yet arrived at “home”, The reception continued. We were loaded onto lorries and standing up we slowly drove on into uncertainty on a country road. After around half an hour we stopped. It was a grey, rainy day and the sky was as sad as our mood and the scenery in front of us. Gurs... le camp de Gurs (camp Gurs)... Barbed wire, grey, corrugated metal barracks as far as one could see. Again a charming reception: “surveillantes” female guards, former prison wardens. One was addressed informally, kicked... en avant... onwards, all my life I hear this harsh, evil en avant. We only had one worry, to be able to stay with the group of women, which whom we had endured one week of suffering and became as close as if we had known each other for years in normal life. - 4 - En avant...but we stuck together and entered our new home. Every barrack consists of 60 people, 30 lying on each side. Every barrack is made of wood. Badly filled straw sacks with old, torn blankets on top, are lying on the floor. Not every sack has a blanket. Fortunately most women brought most women's own blanket. There are neither chairs nor tables and it turns out that this is the worst thing. Always squatting or lying down. Eating food in this position. It seems unimaginable to sit on a chair at a table... But it was May, the merry month of May... even through the barbed wire, the glorious landscape and the snow-covered mountains were so beautiful that sometimes we could forget where we were. But when it was raining, for days and weeks and we immediately sunk into the mud leaving Every barrack, then we were swearing and grumbling and crying ourselves to sleep. Sleeping... how hard it is with so many women, one lying close to the next one on the floor. Before going to sleep we went mouse hunting. Later on there were also rats, running through Every barrack with an eerie hiss. rats, running through the barrack with an eerie hiss were one of the reasons that many illnesses spread in the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus). At nine o’clock the lights had to be turned off. Then we were chatting, sometimes funny stories were told, we talked about days long gone, about lovers. Every woman described Every woman's husband or boyfriend as the most handsome, the best... when many months later those men came to pick up those men's women from the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus), ragged, unshaven, tired... The author often remembered our nightly chats and the wonderful prince who would come to get the wonderful prince who would come to get his Sleeping Beauty's Sleeping Beauty. But those were the happier cases, many men were shot “on the run“ trying to escape the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus). The author remember one woman with a heart condition, who was let go due to one woman with a heart condition, who was let go due to her serious illness's serious illness. No one wanted to be responsible for one woman with a heart condition, who was let go due to her serious illness. When one woman with a heart condition, who was let go due to her serious illness left the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus), one woman with a heart condition, who was let go due to her serious illness made plans how to care for one woman with a heart condition, who was let go due to her serious illness's husband... how happy one woman with a heart condition, who was let go due to her serious illness was... one woman with a heart condition, who was let go due to her serious illness, one woman with a heart condition, who was let go due to her serious illness did not know that one woman with a heart condition, who was let go due to her serious illness's husband was no longer alive. We did not have the courage to tell one woman with a heart condition, who was let go due to her serious illness, we hid the telegram from one woman with a heart condition, who was let go due to her serious illness. The nights were long, often much too long. Snoring, moaning, sobbing, only few women were sleeping quietly. And we were always so hungry. The author remember waking up once because The author's neighbour was rustling with my neighbour's bread wrap. my neighbour was one of the women, who did not like to share and used The nights to eat my neighbour's supplies in secret. - 5 - Unfortunaely The author heard and smelled everything, and it was difficult for The author to stay quiet. Those who did not receive any parcels and did not have any money to buy additional food in the canteen were bad off. The food did not suffice in any way. At 8 in the morning two women (who changed weekly) brought a big bucket full of thin broth, sometimes it was called tea, sometimes coffee. One after the other, in line, presented their metal cup and received a ladle of the delicious drink. With a ladle of the delicious drink the daily ration of bread. One bread was split into seven parts and most women ate everything for most women's first breakfast. For lunch or in the evening, there was either peas or dried cod, all cooked without any fat, but with soda, which has the same effect as bromine. On Sundays and holidays there was rice and meat, three tiny pieces of meat per person, very rarely a tomato or sardine. But there was a canteen, where one could buy marmalade, eggs, fruit, sweets, sausages etc, if one had money. We were allowed to receive money and parcels and The author believe the happiest moment of The day was when mail was delivered. With what excitement did we wait if there was finally a message, a connection with the world behind the barbed wire. Parcels were handed out in the commander’s office. The previous evening there was a list of women posted in the Vel d’Hiver [roundup], which listed those, who would receive a parcel the next morning. We would queue at the Iloteneingang (block entrance) and those, who would receive a parcel the next morning would walk down a country road, down a few hundred metres to the commander’s office, of course accompanied. On this little trip one would pass other Ilots (block inmates) and would sometimes meet old acquaintances, who put their laundry out to dry on the barbed wire. Those, who did not have any money and did not get any parcels, had the opportunity to earn money in the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus). There were grand signs on our barracks: laundry done in here, shoes polished in here, manicure, pedicure, finger waves, tailoring, sewing, language learning, fortune telling, graphology, bridge courses, typewriting work, translations. There was even a camp library and a librarian. One could do gymnastics, dancing, singing, poetry writing. There were dogs and cats, children and old women, there were mondaine and demimondaine girls, actresses, authors, cocottes and cooks. Those who used to be the most spoilt ones were those who now were the most helpful and unassuming. Some had valuable rubber matresses, down feather blankets and pillows, Crepe de Chine (Chinese crêpe) nightwear and wonderful sleeping bags. Others could only save Others's naked skin and did not even have any underwear to change. Many of these German women did not even speak Germany. - 6 - Many of these German women had German passports, but had never seen Germany, were here by coincidence or married to a German. The author would like to know what happened to The author's friends from the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus). The author can see my friends from the camp in The author's mind as if it has been yesterday. The funniest was Anita, who managed to smuggle a whole barrel of wine through the barbed wire one night, complete with a piece of bacon. one night the Vel d’Hiver [roundup] was tipsy and we danced and laughed until the Vel d’Hiver [roundup] was empty. When the weather was good and Anita, who managed to smuggle a whole barrel of wine through the barbed wire one night, complete with a piece of bacon did not have to polish shoes, Anita, who managed to smuggle a whole barrel of wine through the barbed wire one night, complete with a piece of bacon was selling old clothes. Anita, who managed to smuggle a whole barrel of wine through the barbed wire one night, complete with a piece of bacon went from barrack to barrack, carrying dresses or blouses, also shoes or underwear and The author think Anita, who managed to smuggle a whole barrel of wine through the barbed wire one night, complete with a piece of bacon's business was going well – Anita, who managed to smuggle a whole barrel of wine through the barbed wire one night, complete with a piece of bacon was a regular customer in the canteen. Jonny, the camp child, was born in a camp, not in Oleron in the Basses Pyrenees but in another camp near the côte d’azur. Jonny, the camp child was bathed every morning in a bucket and looked always cared for and happy, as if Jonny, the camp child could not imagine a better nursery than a barrack. There was also an extra children’s barrack for the older children. The poor little ones did not get any milk or other supplements. They all looked pale and miserable and their mothers had sleepless nights. Not even the children had beds, and there was no fresh hay to replace the old wet and smelling straw. On Sundays, we brought our hay sacks outside. There was a little bit of green around our barracks leading up to the barbed wire (trifold). There we were lying down and created some little corners with our blankets. Many women wore shorts or long trousers, covering Many women's upper body with colourful shawls. It came with no surprise that the soldiers and the Spanish, who did repair work in the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus), liked to find an excuse to vist us. When it rained heavily we had to open an umbrella in the Vel d’Hiver [roundup] that is how leaky the Vel d’Hiver [roundup] was. The Spanish, who were housed in a camp from the Spanish Civil War further up, had built our barracks. The Spanish, who were housed in a camp from the Spanish Civil War further up built little stools and tables for us and put little boards onto the walls above the hay sacks, where we could store our treasures: supplies, souvenirs and photos. These rare males made a big impression on some women. And later on The author read that some half Spanish child had been born at Oleron in the Basses Pyrenees. Love behind barbed wire...The author have seen barbed wire with The author's own eyes, otherwise The author would not have believed barbed wire. There were girls, who sneaked out of the Vel d’Hiver [roundup] at night, dressed only in a coat and waited until the soldiers had made the soldiers's rounds. Then the guys from around the area appeared and our prisoners pursued our prisoners's old profession through the barbed wire. - 7 - All women of German origin, who lived in Germany, were gradually admitted to Oleron in the Basses Pyrenees. Seven thousand in total, spread to five Ilots (blocks), 25 barracks in every Ilot (block). Every Ilot (block) had a boss, who we elected ourselves, every barrack a barrack boss, who presented a report, wishes and complaints to the Ilot (block) boss on a daily basis. the Ilot (block) boss went to the commander’s office every morning and picked up the latest decrees. This was the only contact to the outside. There was a post barrack, a first aid room and a kitchen barrack. The severely ill were brought to the hospital, which was near the camp entrance and where only Spanish doctors worked. Operations were conducted in Pau. The author will never forget the night we spend fully dressed with our rucksacks packed. They had told us that the Germans were coming. The lamps that usually lighted the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus) were switched off, everyone prepared for everything. It was dead silent, no one was able to sleep. When finally the sun came up and nothing had happened, and the camp routine started again, it suddenly did not seem that awful anymore. Once we organised an evening of performances. performances were in parts highly above average. There was dancing, singing, reciting, old German songs, French chansons, yiddish songs and Rilke poems. The full moon was gleaming over the mountains. We were all sitting on the floor, around a little hill, which acted as a stage and were far away in our thoughts, remembering the times we had been happy. This was all so long ago now. There were many amongst us, who were actual Germans and who came forward at the first call to go back to Germany. Some were unsure and only came forward when they felt the waiting period was too long. An Ilot (block) for German women was formed and it was said there was better food, beds and other easements. In the evening we heard German songs and secretly clenched our fists. But it was too early, we had to wait... wait longer... And then the day came when the gates opened, the liberation. In the same uncanny, sudden and cruel way one had arrived at the camp one was thrown out... “released” at five in the morning we had to stand at the entrance with all luggage packed. The friendly Spanish helped us carrying our luggage to the commander’s's office, where big cars parked, which then brought us to Oleron. The last night on a hay sack, saying goodbye to friends. We exchanged addresses, which meant addresses of an uncle in America, a sister in Argentinia, a friend in South Africa. “That’s safer”...since we did not know where we would end up. - 8 - Not all women who were released left the Vel’ d’Hiver (a circus). It often happened that women, who were found penniless on a country road where brought back to Oleron in the Basses Pyrenees. The author had borrowed some money and wanted to go to Marseilles to renew The author's visa with the Brazilian consul. my visa's first three month of validity were now expired. Our release paper from Oleron in the Basses Pyrenees allowed us to travel freely, therefore we were “demobilised” and The author travelled as the only woman with hundreds of demobilised soldiers, hundreds of demobilised soldiers squeezed into a cattle carriage... hundreds of demobilised soldiers were going home to hundreds of demobilised soldiers's wife and children, hundreds of demobilised soldiers were funny, singing... tins of sardines, cheese, good breadsausages, ham. hundreds of demobilised soldiers enjoyed hundreds of demobilised soldiers's food and shared with The author generously. The author think hundreds of demobilised soldiers enjoyed seeing how much The author enjoyed their food. After all The author had not eaten that well since a long time. hundreds of demobilised soldiers laid down hundreds of demobilised soldiers's coats for The author to lie comfortably, we were singing and The author forgot The author's fear of the days to come. The author stopped in Oleron in the Basses Pyrenees and met old friends. old friends warned The author to go to Marseilles. Lately single women were detained again. But what should The author have done. The author wanted to try everything to get to Brazil, and travelled further through the Provence...Nimes, Arles, Avignon.... The author had always wished to come here, but in different circumstances. The author finally arrived in Marseilles on a Sunday. The author went through the barricades safely, dead tired and shivering with fear. The author found a little hotel and for the first time in months, slept in a proper bed with white sheets. It is impossible to tell how comfortable The author felt when The author ate The author's dinner, bathed in warm water and how incredibly soft a proper bed with white sheets felt, which was probably not even a good bed. But then a terrible time was about to start. The author felt traced because The author knew that single women were observed and arrested in Marseilles. The little money The author had decreased and The author's clothes were in a desolate condition, The author's shoes so torn one could see The author's toes. The author wrote and telegraphed all friends The author could reach asking for money. But Germany was divided into two parts and no one knew if letters would reach all friends I could reach asking for money's destination. The author spend The author's days in the main post office, again and again The author got the same answer: nothing. The author had rented a cheap room from private people, who were very good to The author. The author rushed through the streets, waiting, waiting for a miarcle. And that did come promptly then, a small piece of paper, given to The author by the police, when The author tried to get The author's visa. The author did not travel to Brazil, but as it said on a small piece of paper, given to me by the police, to the Hotel Bompard, near Gorniche. - 9 - In order to investigate The author's situation.... It would only takes 24 hours, don’t take any luggage with you, The author was told. It took four months, four horrendous months, compared to this Gurs seemed comfortable. The Hotel Bompard, a completely unattended house, is close to the sea. The hotel used to be a hotel for emigrating Syrians and belonged to a Syrian family, which consisted of a witch of a mother and three sons. The oldest son oversaw the male prison and since men could buy men off with a large sum this was a lucrative business. Jorge, the second son, was the boss of the Hotel Bompard, the female camp, or better: female prison. The third son was a complete idiot, not dangerous. But The third son was incredibly disgusting and The third son's idiotic grin highlighted the atrocity of the Hotel Bompard, the female camp, or better: female prison. We were 80 women, detained accidentally and without any sense or law. When some women got out for some reason, new victims arrived automatically. the Hotel Bompard, the female camp, or better: female prison was a true guet-apens, a private institution. The police in Marseille was the rewards a certain sum by Germany for every woman at the Hotel Bompard, the female camp, or better: female prison, and the Hotel Bompard, the female camp, or better: female prison's representative Mr Barrolt split the rewards with the Syrian. The author am not excarly sure, The author think a certain sum was 17 francs per day per person. The hotel also received the food for The hotel's inhabitants: oil, sugar, bread etc. since The hotel was always full, this added up to a good sum of money. However, we did not receive any good food, it was probably worse than in Oleron in the Basses Pyrenees. There was a tiny garden at The hotel, mainly with cabbage, some other vegetables and potatoes. cabbage, some other vegetables and potatoes were the ingredients for our daily soup, served for lunch and dinner. Once The author told a friend of The author about this soup in a letter, hoping to receive a parcel. But our post was censored and one evening Jorge, the second son asked The author in Jorge, the second son's office. “Please rewrite a letter, a letter contains a lie. You receive a ragout for lunch and soup for dinner [”] ... Jorge, the second son meant the food at lunch had less water in the food at lunch... Sometimes, once a week, we received small pieces of meat, three per person, which the old woman threw onto the plate. a Syrian family, which consisted of a witch of a mother and three sons was sitting in the same room and was served massive meat portions, a Syrian family, which consisted of a witch of a mother and three sons's smell made us sick, that is how hungry we were. For those with money there was a possibility to get served eggs or meat, those with money liked to make money out of us. We even had to watch how at night time the boxes of sugar, which we were entitled to, were carried away. We were strictly guarded, two wardens marched around the house day and night, another one was sitting in a little hut at the entrance of the Vel d’Hiver [roundup], and two more were inside the Vel d’Hiver [roundup]. - 10 - We were always running around the little green, like animals in a cage to get some exercise, and on Sundays we sat in the sunshine and knitted... knitted... But once a woman managed to escape and we never heard from a woman again. Afterwards we were guarded even more closely. One woman who dared to complain was then held in isolation and a soldier with a soldier with his rifle's rifle sat outside One woman who dared to complain's room day and night, since One woman who dared to complain was not allowed to leave her room. Later we were not even allowed to receive visitors on Sundays in the Vel d’Hiver [roundup], which had been allowed before. It was also nearly impossible to get any message out. Yet the guards were quite humane. Sometimes the guards shared the guards's food with a hungry little girl. We slept in a room with three, four or even six people, mainly two in one bed. There were few blankets and we had to wash our sheets ourselves. There was a shared living/dining room for all women. We spend all day in there when it was too cold or too rainy to go into the Vel d’Hiver [roundup] and if one did not prefer to stay in bed, dreaming or reading. Far away we could see the sea, freedom, but no one dared to hope living in normal times again. There were all sorts of women, a colourful mix. There were even children, mostly even children's fathers were detained in Les Milles. When their fathers were freed, their fathers's wives were discharged, too. Once, and The author will never forget this, Marseille was bombed. We were already sleeping, because we were send to bed by 8pm to save on lighting. From quarter past 8 no lights were allowed apart from candles, in case we could get hold of some. Candles were rare at the time and only available in churches. We send for Candles and Candles helped us through many a night. In this terrible night we saw the bombs dropped a few metres from us, we saw the bombs's fires and were not allowed to leave the room. The policemen pushed us back like cattle, when we forcibly tried to escape. Once a young girl was admitted, a medicine student. a young girl had a lung disease and begged the patron to let a young girl go, a young girl had a fever and could not survive in the cold rooms. A stone-deaf doctor was sent, who declared a young girl was healthy. To days later a young girl attempted suicide. The author can still see a young girl, a young girl was lying there, so frail and white... a young girl was moved quickly and fortunately could be saved... and was detained again. Thank God not for long, a young girl managed to be released soon. There was another attempted suicide and a quiet, sensible looking girl got an attack of folie furieuse (madness). - 11 - When the ambulance van stopped with sirens on in front of a little hotel, nobody believed that a quiet, sensible looking girl would come back after a few weeks. a quiet, sensible looking girl had turned into a quiet person, but a quiet, sensible looking girl was endlessly calm, sad, and apathic, it seemed something had broken inside a quiet, sensible looking girl. ‘Completely cured’, they said. We all became more and more nervous, and sadder, because we were neither allowed radio nor newspaper, because we had no idea what was happen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

97,"['Mrs Laszlo was a schoolgirl of thirteen when the German Nazis occupied Mrs Laszlo's native town. The report describes the two ghettoes in her native town and Mrs Laszlo's deportation in May 1944 (p.3-4) to Auschwitz, however the train which carried Mrs Laszlo and Mrs Laszlo's family instead took the deportees to Vienna. The children - between 7 and 13 years old - had to clear the bomb-sites in the suburbs. The children - between 7 and 13 years old - were always hungry, but sometimes non-Jews helped The children - between 7 and 13 years old - to an additional ration, another time The children - between 7 and 13 years old - helped to find The children - between 7 and 13 years old -'s way back to the Camp when The children - between 7 and 13 years old - got lost in the streets. Others hid The children - between 7 and 13 years old - after a bomb hit the school in which The children - between 7 and 13 years old - were interned (p.5-6). The children - between 7 and 13 years old - always lived in abandoned school-buildings and occasionally had to sweep the snow off the street around others. Epidemics; transport (p.7-8), during which a disastrous attack ruined a station at Vienna; the survivors were taken back to the Camp. Vivid description of the days that followed and the way home, partly covered on foot. Recollections Of A Child-Deportee When the German Nazis the invasion of the Germans Hungary in March 1944, Mrs M. Laszlo was a 13-year-old schoolgirl and attended the Jewish Public School in her native town. Mrs M. Laszlo didn’t care much about what was going on in the world. Mrs M. Laszlo's day moved regularly between home, school and a circle of friends. Mrs M. Laszlo knew there was a war on and heard the grown- ups say that the German Nazis would lose a war in the end – but all that did not mean much to Mrs M. Laszlo. One morning, on the way to school, Mrs M. Laszlo saw many cars and motorcycles filled with German soldiers in the streets. The inhabitants remained standing in the street and watched the invasion of the German Nazis; many were upset. In We children's class the teacher told We children to go straight home without delay after the end of school and to linger as little as possible in the street. At home the adults looked serious and put the adults's heads together. We children still went the next day and the day after that to school, but on the third morning the teacher told We children that for the time being school would remain closed; We children should just remain quietly with We children's parents at home – We children would be informed in good time as soon as the lessons were to resume. But no such information came and the days passed. our parents did not let We children go out onto the street and We children stayed home for the whole time. We children did not dare to be happy that We children were off school; for our parents kept saying that difficult times lay ahead now. Neighbours and friends came in and out. All looked serious and talked a great deal and excitedly with each other. A heavy weight descended on all of We children, and We children were also not spared. Mrs M. Laszlo also had three sisters; furthermore a boy soon joined We children, a cousin from the nearby town of Munkacs, who had been sent to We children because a boy's father had been called up for labour service. But soon after, Mrs M. Laszlo's own father was called up for labour service, too; and Mrs M. Laszlo's mother remained at home with the four girls aged 19, 14, 13 and 11, as well as with a boy. A new decree was issued, whereby all Jews had to wear a yellow star on all Jews's clothing on all Jews's left chest. my mother cut a yellow star in the prescribed size out of yellow fabric and sewed a yellow star onto the clothes for We children. It was an uncanny feeling having to wear a yellow star. And it was even more uncanny when one looked out of the window and saw how the street had changed, how people, who until now one had felt to be equal, suddenly fell into two groups – into those who wore a yellow star and those who did not. a yellow star were so blatant, that a yellow star practically appeared to be screaming through the quiet street. It was as if a yellow star not only possessed a colour but also a voice. For the first time Mrs M. Laszlo understood what it meant to be born Jewish and that it must be a special destiny to belong to the Jewish community. Shortly after, there was again a new decree – and a new decree was worse. All Jews of her native town had to this purpose together, and for this purpose a ghetto was created. Previously, We children had learned at school that We children's ancestors had resided and lived in a ghetto in the middle ages. Now We children suddenly and unexpectedly went through the experience of being locked into a newly created ghetto, and it felt as if the whole world as We children had known the whole world as we had known it until now until now was foundering at a stroke. To begin with, two ghettos were set up in her native town. One – We children called the “large ghetto” the “small ghetto” – stretched around Csokonai Lane where We children's house stood. This was considered to be good fortune within We children's misfortune; for it meant for We children that We children did not need to move, but remained in We children's own walls. But it was not We children's old familiar apartment any longer. We children had to squeeze together into a single room and two related families were quartered in the other two rooms of a single room. The kitchen remained communal. The three living spaces now housed three families of altogether 15 to 20 souls. And We children could consider We children lucky; for all the surrounding apartments and houses were occupied even more heavily. When one now looked out of the window or even dared step over the threshold, one would only see people with yellow stars on people with yellow stars on their chests's chests. the whole world as we had known it until now had changed. the whole world as we had known it until now had become narrow and felt like a prison. In the middle of Zugo Lane one could spot a wooden fence which closed off a ghetto from the world outside. And it was the same in the other direction, in Garai Lane. This was now We children's new, We children's shrunken world. But not for long. New changes arrived and New changes always got worse and worse. After about a week We children were driven out of a ghetto into the “large ghetto”. the “large ghetto” was a somewhat more extensive block of streets surrounding the Jewish Temple. The school building also fell within the “large ghetto” and the “large ghetto” is where We children's family, along with many others, were placed. We children had to leave all We children's possessions behind; We children only carried a small bundle with We children. Around 80 people lay on straw in one classroom, mainly women, children and older men. But again We children had good fortune within We children's misfortune. We children's father joined We children and from now on his father stayed with We children. When his father learned of We children's fate, his father obtained leave from his father's work company and never returned from leave from his work company to labour service. three families of altogether 15 to 20 souls now stayed together. After a few days We children were billeted out of the school building and taken in a long column to the nearby tile factory. It was even worse there. People lay close together in People's hundreds in the nearby tile factory. The nights were cold and the rain drove in. But it was to get worse still. Mid- May brought the call for all inhabitants of a ghetto to depart. Rumours were already circulating that We children were all being taken by train somewhere far away. Mrs M. Laszlo would only learn the word for it – “Deportation” – later on. First of all We children set off on foot, accompanied by gendarmes and armed men. We children had to march for several hours until We children arrived at her native town. It was extremely hot and We children were all very thirsty. Farmers stood the length of Lang Street and watched the sad column. Mrs M. Laszlo's father called out to a farmer whom his father knew from before and asked his father for some water. a farmer whom he knew from before did not move. But a farmer whom he knew from before's wife, who was standing next to a farmer whom he knew from before, rushed into the house and came out straight away with a jug filled with water. Just as his wife, who was standing next to him was about to hand a jug filled with water to We children, a farmer whom he knew from before stepped up and hit a jug filled with water with angry words out of his wife, who was standing next to him's hand. We children had to carry on thirsty and tired. We children slept over in a shack close to her native town. A stretch of the railway ran next to the railway and on the next day We children were loaded into a waggon. We children were not in those beautiful airy train compartments that Mrs M. Laszlo had known before, but in dirty, dark locked waggons, usually used to transport animals. We children were pushed close together. Whoever had a spot by the wall could consider himself lucky to be able to lean against a spot by the wall; the rest had to squat on the dirty floor when the rest were tired - there was no room to stretch or lie down. Now there followed terrible days. The carriage drove and drove, then stopped again for a long time, rolled on, came to a halt again. None of We children knew where it was going, nobody could count how many days and nights We children were underway. Daylight entered only very sparingly with a few rays through the small, barred window; the doors were shut tight. The air was insufferably bad. Everyone had a few provisions with them; however, thirst plagued We children uninterruptedly. When The carriage stopped in some place where We children could hear human voices outside, We children would call through the small, barred window and beg for fresh water. Sometimes We children received some, but not usually. At one station the inmates of We children's waggon threw notes out of the small, barred window in order to get water. water was collected outside, but We children received nothing and The carriage rolled on. At another station again, those who dared to move to the small, barred window were driven back with rough words. Nobody knew where this terrible journey was going. We children made out Hungarian words outside and since this terrible journey lasted many days and nights, We children figured that We children were being driven forwards and backwards through Hungarian territory. Often We children also felt that The carriage was rolling backwards. We children frequently remained for many, many hours in the same spot. Then on The carriage would go again. All sense of time was lost. Finally at a further stop, We children heard German being spoken outside. Off We children went once more, then our waggon came to a final stop, the doors were opened and We children were ordered to “disembark”. We children staggered out; it was hardly possible to walk. We children finally breathed fresh air after such a long time, even received a bit of water to drink. We children discovered that We children were in Hungary. But of all the inmates of the Debrecen Ghetto who had been loaded onto the wagon in her native town, only this one train had arrived here. We children looked for the others in vain. Only much later, after a war, did We children learn that most of the other trains were taken to Auschwitz. Only very few of the inmates of the other trains returned. Most of the inmates of these trains perished. After travelling forwards and backwards across Hungary, We children's train had been taken near Vienna and that was apparently because the tracks leading northwards had been ripped out during an air attack and We children's train had to be shunted in the other direction. It has never been possible to establish firmly whether this is based on true facts. Luckily We children's family had remained together. After a lengthy wait and more toing and froing, We children were taken by another train to a suburb of Vienna. There We children were herded first into a “delousing barrack”. We children, had to undress We children completely and were stood under a water nozzle. Young SS people directed We children here and there with much screaming. Naked as We children were, We children then had to stand on scales, We children's weight was established, We children's body mass measured. Completely exhausted and broken as We children were, We children allowed everything to happen to We children without resistance. Then We children were allowed to dress again; but many of We children's possessions had been stolen in the meantime. Mrs M. Laszlo's little sister, who wore a Mogen Dovid[1] on a small chain round My little sister, who wore a Mogen Dovid[1] on a small chain round her neck's neck, had a Mogen Dovid[1] on a small chain round her neck torn off by an SS man before Mrs M. Laszlo's very own eyes. Now We children were housed and indeed We children's family was placed again in a school building like in the Debrecen “Big Ghetto”. Now and for the next few months it seemed to be Mrs M. Laszlo's fate, that although Mrs M. Laszlo was off school, Mrs M. Laszlo had to spend Mrs M. Laszlo's life in school rooms, lying on straw sacks. At any rate We children were now assigned to work. The adults were asked what The adults's occupation was. Mrs M. Laszlo's father became a worker in an iron factory, where his father had to go early every morning together with a whole group only to return late in the evening. Mrs M. Laszlo's older sisters were also placed in the adult group and had to work somewhere. Mrs M. Laszlo, Mrs M. Laszlo's little sister and a boy were placed in a whole group. A former teacher at the her native town school who was appointed leader of a whole group led We children daily to We children's workplace. In the evenings A former teacher at the Debrecen school who was appointed leader of this group taught We children German, which many of We children understood anyhow. Every morning at seven a whole group were ushered out, and We children only returned at dusk. We children moved through the streets of the Viennese suburb in We children's torn clothes, with wooden clogs, the yellow star on We children's chest. We children had to clear away the debris in bombed houses or clean the streets of the Viennese suburb. We children received food in the camp in the school building, where the kitchen was run by the older women, Mrs M. Laszlo's mother amongst them, too. However, the fare was so meagre, that We children were always hungry. Every now and then compassionate people on the street pressed something to eat into We children's hands, but only if the accompanying SS men were not paying attention. When We children were being led through the streets of the Viennese suburb, it would happen that Viennese women would furtively drop bread and milk cards on the pavement and then would silently wink towards where bread and milk cards lay. Sometimes We children could pick bread and milk cards up behind the backs of We children's SS attendants and in the evening secretly hand bread and milk cards over in the kitchen, where the older women, my mother amongst them could make use of bread and milk cards. One day in particular has stayed in Mrs M. Laszlo's memory. A group of us, consisting of three or four children, had slipped away from the place of work shortly before the end of school and were roaming curiously through the nearby lanes. A group of us, consisting of three or four children stopped in front of a food shop and looked with rumbling stomachs through the shop window. Some Austrian children came along, noticed A group of us, consisting of three or four children with A group of us, consisting of three or four children's yellow stars and started to shout abuse and to throw stones at A group of us, consisting of three or four children. A group of us, consisting of three or four children ran away, but could not find the way back to a food shop and got lost in the coming darkness. Crying, A group of us, consisting of three or four children wandered around lost; then A group of us, consisting of three or four children remembered that the most horrible punishments had been threatened for those who were not in the camp when the gates were closed. Finally, an adult addressed A group of us, consisting of three or four children, and A group of us, consisting of three or four children could tell from an adult's friendly tone that an adult meant well. A group of us, consisting of three or four children culled all A group of us, consisting of three or four children's German language knowledge and were able to make an adult understand that A group of us, consisting of three or four children's camp, in other words A group of us, consisting of three or four children's school accommodation, was in Garai Lane. an adult led A group of us, consisting of three or four children to a tram stop and handed A group of us, consisting of three or four children to the conductor, who then – even though A group of us, consisting of three or four children did not have a penny for the fare on A group of us, consisting of three or four children – took A group of us, consisting of three or four children near to our camp, in other words our school accommodation and described the rest of the way exactly to A group of us, consisting of three or four children. A group of us, consisting of three or four children found the gates already closed, but an adult let A group of us, consisting of three or four children through. This was the only time when A group of us, consisting of three or four children did not return on foot but by tram to our camp, in other words our school accommodation. There were many air raid warnings at the time and during one bomb attack A group of us, consisting of three or four children's school accommodation took a direct hit. Some inmates used a direct hit to flee, but Some inmates were returned in the next few days. The damaged school building was cleared and A group of us, consisting of three or four children arrived at the Camp. As far as Mrs M. Laszlo can recall, the name of the street was Leopold Ferstel Lane, or something like Leopold Ferstel Lane. Shortly afterwards, her native town came under an even stronger air attack. One bomb dropped into the cellar where A group of us, consisting of three or four children were, but did not explode. our camp, in other words our school accommodation dispersed. Mrs M. Laszlo's sister knew a well-disposed Viennese woman from the factory where my little sister worked and A group of us, consisting of three or four children sought refuge with my little sister. my little sister took A group of us, consisting of three or four children in and hid A group of us, consisting of three or four children in the cellar where we were from my little sister's own husband, who was in the Nazi party. my little sister also secretly gave A group of us, consisting of three or four children food. A group of us, consisting of three or four children spent two to three days there; then A group of us, consisting of three or four children heard that posters had been put up in the streets, telling all dispersed forced labourers to report to a new camp. The death penalty was threatened for those who did not report themselves. A group of us, consisting of three or four children went there – and her native town was again a school building. our camp, in other words our school accommodation must have lain closer than the previous two to the inner city, for A group of us, consisting of three or four children's daily route to work now led through livelier streets, and the tower of Stephan’s church was pointed out to A group of us, consisting of three or four children on the way. Mrs M. Laszlo no longer know the precise name of the lane where A group of us, consisting of three or four children were put up. Around this time there was an outbreak of scarlet fever amongst the children and Mrs M. Laszlo, too, was afflicted with an outbreak of scarlet fever amongst the children. A classroom was turned into an isolation ward, and after a few days A group of us, consisting of three or four children were taken to an emergency hospital where there were many sick people, not just Hungarian Jews, but also French prisoners of war, and forced labourers, who spoke all kinds of languages. The doctors were also made up of prisoners, amongst prisoners, amongst them many Hungarian Jews many Hungarian Jews. By contrast, the nursing staff consisted of Austrian nurses. In every ward there lay twelve patients. Later Mrs M. Laszlo's mother became ill, too, and was brought to the nearby tile factory. Altogether Mrs M. Laszlo lay there for about six weeks and was then returned to the school accommodation, although Mrs M. Laszlo was very weak. Work restarted. In the meantime autumn and winter came and now A group of us, consisting of three or four children not only had to clear rubble away but frequently shovel snow, too. A group of us, consisting of three or four children froze in A group of us, consisting of three or four children's thin clothes. Mrs M. Laszlo remember one day shovelling snow in front of a different, operating, school and the Austrian children staring, whilst A group of us, consisting of three or four children, freezing and hungry, the yellow star on A group of us, consisting of three or four children's chest, were shovelling snow in front of the school entrance. Gradually there was fresh movement in the camp. The inmates were re-counted and inspected and again divided into groups. Many rumours circulated. One day a number of younger, stronger men were transported away in busses. a number of younger, stronger men's relations remained behind and this was the first case of families being rent apart amongst A group of us, consisting of three or four children's party. We children never heard anything again about those who had been transported away in this manner and do not even know where those who had been transported away in this manner were taken. A short time later, a second transport left by train. This time We children were told that We children could volunteer and that three families of altogether 15 to 20 souls would remain together. Many presented themselves, because they believed they would go to a better place. We children never heard from them again either. We children's family also left Vienna with the third transport, which departed in spring. We children were again penned into cattle waggons, although this time not as tightly packed. Nor did the journey take We children very far. We children arrived at Strasshof camp, a hutted camp, which housed many people. Here, we Hungarian Jews were just a small group; all possible nationalities were gathered here, forced labourers and prisoners of war from all kinds of countries. The food was worse than The food had ever been; We children starved terribly. Sometimes We children received nothing but turnip soup for days, in the mornings, at lunchtime and in the evenings. The overseers consisted partly of Germans, partly of Ukrainians, and the latter in particular treated the prisoners mercilessly, yelling at the prisoners and hitting the prisoners with sticks. Mrs M. Laszlo's father was also once hit by a Ukrainian woman who was an overseer there, causing his father's head to bleed. In the meantime, news spread that the German Nazis were advancing and everyone hoped for imminent liberation. It was already possible to hear cannon thunder in the distance. All the greater was the agitation when one day our camp, in other words our school accommodation was loaded onto waggons. Amongst the other prisoners were some who already had been dragged for years from one camp to another, and some who already had been dragged for years from one camp to another were able to tell A group of us, consisting of three or four children that there were extermination camps, and that people were being killed there in people's innumerable thousands. We children were frightened that We children would still be taken now, close to the end of a war, to such extermination camps. When the waggon, tightly packed with prisoners, set in motion, the mood was more desperate than ever before. But We children were not to get far. Already at the first station train stopped and A group of us, consisting of three or four children stood still for many hours. The doors were as always tightly shut and A group of us, consisting of three or four children could not observe what was happening outside. But soon A group of us, consisting of three or four children heard the noise of aircraft engines, the explosions of bombs and the rattling of defensive shelling. The adults amongst We children said that the station where A group of us, consisting of three or four children's train was standing was being bombarded. A group of us, consisting of three or four children were completely defencelessly locked in the waggon, tightly packed with prisoners and already believed A group of us, consisting of three or four children to be lost. After a long time, the noise of aircraft engines, the explosions of bombs and the rattling of defensive shelling gradually subsided. the doors were opened and A group of us, consisting of three or four children got out. A group of us, consisting of three or four children saw that the posterior waggons of A group of us, consisting of three or four children's train had been struck by bombs. Dead and wounded were being carried away on stretchers. We A group of us, consisting of three or four children had been spared. the first station was badly damaged, the tracks ripped up in many places. A group of us, consisting of three or four children received the order to march back to our camp, in other words our school accommodation on foot and only now did A group of us, consisting of three or four children have the opportunity to note just how short a stretch train had actually covered. A group of us, consisting of three or four children spent the night again in our camp, in other words our school accommodation. But the next day, the overseers and guards had vanished. A group of us, consisting of three or four children understood that the overseers and guards had fled before the German Nazis and that A group of us, consisting of three or four children were free. the older women, my mother amongst them, too gathered and elected from the older women, my mother amongst them, too's midst a management, to take charge of our camp, in other words our school accommodation until it would be possible for everybody to go home. For the time being that was not yet the case, for A group of us, consisting of three or four children could hear in the immediate vicinity cannon thunder and the fighting was obviously still continuing. Although the guards had taken to the guards's heels, one nevertheless had to worry that German soldiers could still be in the vicinity. When over the course of the day no uniformed figures appeared A group of us, consisting of three or four children gradually became bolder and, in small groups, made incursions into the area surrounding our camp, in other words our school accommodation. It was a wonderful feeling to be able to go where one wanted without supervision and coercion. Some of A group of us, consisting of three or four children went as far as the station grounds which had been bombed the previous day. Everything lay in ruins; a picture of utter devastation presented a picture of utter devastation before A group of us, consisting of three or four children's eyes. train was completely destroyed and burnt. The waggons, or what remained of The waggons, lay strewn off the tracks. The waggons, or what remained of them's contents were plundered, but here and there lay some remnants, including some foodstuff. A group of us, consisting of three or four children spotted a pile of half-charred potatoes and threw A group of us, consisting of three or four children on a pile of half-charred potatoes. half-charred potatoes were still warm from the fire that had raged here. half-charred potatoes had a peculiar phosphorus and iron smell, nevertheless A group of us, consisting of three or four children were happy to eat warm potatoes – a dish that A group of us, consisting of three or four children had missed for a very long time. Adults from our camp, in other words our school accommodation arrived and started searching the area systematically for preserved food items. A group of us, consisting of three or four children also found a whole ton of pickled herring, which A group of us, consisting of three or four children collected in linen bundles and dragged to our camp, in other words our school accommodation. So after all the hunger of past times A group of us, consisting of three or four children could prepare a good evening meal, but unfortunately there was no bread to be found near or far and A group of us, consisting of three or four children had to consume a whole ton of pickled herring, which we collected in linen bundles and dragged to the camp together with half-charred potatoes. So passed another two days. The sound of battle kept coming closer. On the one side of our camp, in other words our school accommodation were wide fields; woods stretched on the other side. Early in the morning of the third day A group of us, consisting of three or four children saw German soldiers in disorderly columns, many without weapons, hastily withdraw from the woods. A group of us, consisting of three or four children hid in the barracks, but German soldiers in disorderly columns, many without weapons, did not pay any attention to our camp, in other words our school accommodation. German soldiers in disorderly columns, many without weapons, were in a great hurry and disappeared in the direction of the station. When everything remained quiet, some of A group of us, consisting of three or four children dared enter the woods and saw there discarded weapons, broken carts and all kind of apparatus. They brought back empty discarded tins. A group of us, consisting of three or four children's hunger was still so great, that A group of us, consisting of three or four children licked out empty discarded tins and ate up all food remnants on which A group of us, consisting of three or four children could lay A group of us, consisting of three or four children's hands. A short time later Russian soldiers, at first individually, then in twos, came out of the woods looking for Germans; by the evening, whole Russian columns marched through our camp, in other words our school accommodation. The next day our camp, in other words our school accommodation already began to disintegrate. Anyone who was in a position to, and was sure of the way home, set off to return home. Mrs M. Laszlo's father got hold of a cart and horse in the next village and three families of altogether 15 to 20 souls was on three families of altogether 15 to 20 souls's way. At first A group of us, consisting of three or four children reached Pressburg, where A group of us, consisting of three or four children exchanged the horse for food and first of all ate A group of us, consisting of three or four children's fill. Then A group of us, consisting of three or four children continued on A group of us, consisting of three or four children's way in any manner A group of us, consisting of three or four children could: on foot, sometimes – if A group of us, consisting of three or four children were lucky – also by car, and for short stretches even by train. Every day, A group of us, consisting of three or four children advanced only a short stretch; A group of us, consisting of three or four children were, however, back in Hungary and nearing A group of us, consisting of three or four children's home town. The journey continued via Godollo and Szolnik, and on 10 May, 1945, about a year after A group of us, consisting of three or four children had arrived in the Ghetto, A group of us, consisting of three or four children moved back into her native town.

98,"['A report by a Jewish woman, who lived in Frankfurt in a mixed marriage. After having succeeded in placing a Jewish woman, who lived in Frankfurt in a mixed marriage's children with non-Jewish families, a Jewish woman, who lived in Frankfurt in a mixed marriage tried unsuccessfully to escape arrest. a Jewish woman, who lived in Frankfurt in a mixed marriage was deported to Auschwitz on 13 September 1943. Twice a Jewish woman, who lived in Frankfurt in a mixed marriage managed to escape the gas chamber after having been selected. In one case the concentration camp commander Kramer protected a Jewish woman, who lived in Frankfurt in a mixed marriage. At the end of 1944 a Jewish woman, who lived in Frankfurt in a mixed marriage was transported to Bergen-Belsen, and finally to Braunschweig and Bendorf. From there a Jewish woman, who lived in Frankfurt in a mixed marriage was sent to Sweden via Denmark as the result of the agreement between Bernadotte and Himmler. 9. Further References : 10. Remarks : Auschwitz Report I was married to an ""Aryan"" man, who became a soldier in 1938. I first ran into difficulties in August 1943, when all Jewish women in Frankfurt, even if all Jewish women in Frankfurt am Main, even if they were married to Aryans were married to Aryans, were called up for military service. I went to a print works. Left there in a hurry after 1 month because I saw that women were being taken away by the Gestapo every day and were never heard of again. The first thing I did was to find a place, with help from a brother-in-law, for my children to stay, 2 sons and a daughter, and in fact my brother-in-law managed to get her children placed with Nazi families. her children were never allowed to say that her children had a Jewish mother, her children were not allowed to know of my existence at all, this was the only way we could hope to bring her children through unscathed, in which we also succeeded. I travelled first to Berlin, from there to the Sudetengau. Because relatives in Frankfurt were being watched, relatives in Frankfurt am Main managed to find out where I was through the letters that I wrote to relatives in Frankfurt am Main, even though the letters that I wrote to them were written under a false name. One day I was lying in a field and sunbathing, when suddenly there were two officials next to me who arrested me, two officials next to me who arrested me were extremely friendly though. I was then transferred to Frankfurt and held in the police cells. I was taken to the the Gestapo headquarters in Lindenstrasse for questioning every day. I was very badly treated every time I went for questioning, showered with insults: ""You Jewish pig, you dirty whore etc."" Time and again I had to tell two officials next to me who arrested me why I had run away. While waiting to go to the interrogation I had to wait in a basement cell in Lindenstrasse and listen to the terrible screams of people, especially men, who were tortured there almost every day. In prison we only had straw mattresses to lie on. There were about 10 of us Jewish women in the room all together, I met old acquaintances there too. We were friendly to each other, but we never knew, when we were taken individually for questioning, whether we would see each other again. The wardens were not bad to us, The wardens slipped things to us from time to time. My husband was with me twice on leave. My husband tried everything to get me free. My husband even travelled to Berlin and asked to see Himmler; Himmler was not admitted though. My husband then asked in Prinz-Albrechtstrasse what My husband was actually fighting for if My husband's wife and the mother of My husband's 3 children, who never did anything wrong in his 3 children, who never did anything wrong in her life's life, was taken away. From that time on My husband was never promoted in the Gestapo again. - 2 - On 13.9.1943 we were transported on cattle trucks to Auschwitz. When we arrived, we were sorted and led to a bathroom where we had to undress stark naked in front of 18, 19 year-old SS-people and were beaten by 18, 19 year-old SS-people with truncheons. We got neither soap nor towel. Still soaking wet, we had to run as we were to a barracks, were given a blanket and then went back out in the rain to a different barracks where we lay on the bare floor. Then a female supervisor came and cut off all our hair. I recoiled from myself every time I saw myself in a window pane or suchlike. After that our number was branded on our left lower arm. Finally, we were handed prison clothing, naturally with the Star of David on the front and back. The next day, an SS-sergeant came to assign us to work. We were put to work on road construction. work was too hard for me. After a time I reported in sick. Tried to stay in the quarantine block for as long as possible. When I noticed that patients were taken for gassing if patients were there for a long time, I went back to work and went first to the weaving mill, then back to road construction, had to carry heavy water pipes, and I developed bladder and kidney problems. We had roll-call every morning between 3 and 4, we were not allowed to wear trousers or stockings despite the cold. After 4 months, I was selected for gassing in the crematorium for the first time, Block 24, along with a large group. Out of sheer panic, our people hit and bit a large group. a large group had to strip naked and were crammed into a truck, the sick thrown in, and the first deaths happened at that point. I stood in a truck in such a way that I could let myself fall out. a truck drove on, the military escort did not notice anything. I must then have lain there unconscious and was found by an SS-patrol and taken to a hospital barracks. I woke up there in a bunk. Shortly after, Commander Kramer came to my bunk and asked me why I jumped down, I appeared to be afraid for my life. So I told Commander Kramer, ""Yes, I want to go on living. I have three children and my husband is a soldier and my husband is fighting for you and I\'m supposed to die here?"" Surprisingly, Commander Kramer then said to me,"" You are a brave woman."" And gave instructions that I should stay in the crematorium for the time being, that I would be given better food until I had recovered a little. I was there for 4 weeks, was looked after very well, as far as that was possible, by a Russian nurse who was a prisoner of war. - 2 - When I had been out of the crematorium for about a month, I was again selected for gassing. I hid myself in a vat of slurry at the last minute, with only my mouth poking out. Since we were not summoned by name or by number, when my absence meant they did not have the right number of people, they took a fellow-prisoner instead. Everyone simply tried to save themselves. A fellow-Jew from Denmark helped me out of the barrel, gave me a hand in cleaning myself up, and then I went back into the quarantine block and carried on working. On my return the ill-treatment got worse, we often had to stand for hours which was particularly hard for me because of the injury I had sustained in the fall, the female supervisors and guard teams also regularly brought dogs with the female supervisors and guard teams. It was terrible. I cannot put into words what our treatment was like, people today would simply not believe our treatment. From the moment I was arrested and for years afterwards I lived in a constant state of fear. When the gassings were happening, the prison band had to play, the Gestapo then drank and sometimes also danced with the female supervisors. There were many deaths from typhoid fever caused by contaminated water. We were all very weak, were only given gruel with nettles in gruel with nettles in it once a day once a day. Towards the end of 1944, when the Russians were getting closer, we were transported to Bergen-Belsen. As the camp was still under construction, we had to sleep out in the open at night to start with. When we were given the order to take a shower, we thought we were going to be gassed. An elderly soldier whose job it was to oversee bathing had a job persuading us to bathe before we dared do it. Our treatment in Belsen was generally very bad. We stayed there for about two months and had to help with the construction of the camp. Then we were taken to Brunswick, by then everyone I knew who had come to Auschwitz with me was already dead. There we were used to remove rubble. The last stop was Bendorf. There our supervisor said to us several times: ""The holes are already dug for you, you’ll be right at home there."" Of course, we thought that our end was nigh. We had no idea that an exchange or something similar had been agreed by the Swedish Count Bernadotte and Himmler, and that we were suddenly to be taken to Sweden via Denmark; our supervisor will have known that, and our supervisor scared us because our supervisor was angry about it. In short, one day the unexpected miracle happened, we were free. We could not grasp the fact for a long, long time. Unfortunately many still died, particularly those who were not careful with what they ate. We were treated splendidly. I stayed in Sweden for a year.

99,"[""Miss Nelly Wolffheim, formerly a well-known nursery teacher and child’s psychologist in Berlin, started after That same year to train Jewish girls in these subjects, holding seminars, firstly illegal, later officially recognised as “Umschulungslehrgaenge” of the Jewish Community. myself as the principal was born in Berlin. In the years between 1896 - 99 myself as the principal had the privilege of being educated at Pestalozzi-Fröbelhaus, myself as the principal passed the exam to become a nursery school assistant and attended further seminars and training to become a teacher at nursery school level. myself as the principal worked as a tutor and a writer and myself as the principal held lectures. For many years myself as the principal directed myself as the principal's private nursery from a specific pedagogical perspective. myself as the principal embarked on a study of psychoanalysis in 1922. myself as the principal's working arrangements came to an abrupt end following the circumstances in That same year. myself as the principal had to cut short myself as the principal's writing activities, and myself as the principal was no longer able to hold any more public lectures. That same year myself as the principal started to educate a few Jewish girls privately in my private nursery; a few Jewish girls were not allowed to attend the public seminars in my private nursery. At the end of 33 the head of the department for careers guidance in the Jewish commune suggested to myself as the principal, that myself as the principal should establish a course for young girls. Some of young girls had been kicked out of Some of these young girls's schools, and others had been evicted from others's places of work. Some of young girls had been so psychologically harmed by their experiences, that the careers guidance officer regarded attendance at a course for young girls, albeit along psycho-analytic guidelines, to be a form of regimen. A small bunch of youngsters gathered around myself as the principal, young people who had lost young people who had lost their way in the world, girls, some of whom bore the marks of mental trauma's way in the world, girls, some of whom bore the marks of mental trauma. It was little steps like this that marked the beginning of the seminars. myself as the principal was moonlighting at first. It was illegal to instruct young girls without official authorisation. We were in constant fear, i.e. myself as the principal's female pupils and myself as the principal, that we would be punished and the seminar closed down. the seminar was indeed shut down for a few days, for some reason or another that myself as the principal no longer recall. There must have been a complaint made by a Nazi resident. myself as the principal did admittedly try to buy the silence of one of our fellow tenants, a tailor, by ordering an expensive coat from one of our fellow tenants, a tailor. When this state of anxiety became too much to bear, myself as the principal sought the advice of an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got himself struck off for political reasons struck off for political reasons. It was a matter of approaching an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got himself struck off for political reasons with a view to obtaining official authorisation to conduct the seminar. Because an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got himself struck off for political reasons had good connections to the relevant Nazi officials, who looked after such matters, an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got himself struck off for political reasons put in a petition on myself as the principal's behalf. a petition was drawn up in such a way, that receiving no reply would mean that permission had been granted. an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got himself struck off for political reasons took it upon an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got himself struck off for political reasons to ensure that an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got himself struck off for political reasons got to see how a petition became buried deep down in the drawers, so that there was no danger of the authorisation being revoked. We were therefore able to carry on working quietly for a while. - 2 - After around a year, at the start of That same year, the number of female pupils increased, whereupon an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got himself struck off for political reasons advised myself as the principal that it was now time to obtain confirmation of the authorisation. an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got himself struck off for political reasons left Berlin at short notice, and an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got himself struck off for political reasons's wife, who had been a police counsellor up to that time, took over myself as the principal's case. By knowingly using his wife, who had been a police counsellor up to that time's female charm, his wife, who had been a police counsellor up to that time managed to get an elderly official to give approval, providing the Jewish commune were prepared to act as the legal entity for the seminar. myself as the principal managed to arrange for both of us to meet with the board of the Jewish commune. As was customary at the time the gentlemen of the Jewish commune were very judgemental of an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got himself struck off for political reasons and fully suspected that an “Aryan” lawyer, who had got himself struck off for political reasons might possibly be a Nazi spy. In the end, however, the Jewish commune in Berlin endorsed myself as the principal's seminar and gave the seminar the pseudonym of “Umschulungslehrgänge” (retraining courses). The official recognition actually made it much more difficult to teach in the seminar, in so far as we had to put up with the vexatious regulations. Once when a female school inspector came to sit in on us, his wife, who had been a police counsellor up to that time was full of praise and amazement at the quality of the journal one schoolgirl had compiled. his wife, who had been a police counsellor up to that time asked us, if his wife, who had been a police counsellor up to that time could be permitted to take some of the journals with his wife, who had been a police counsellor up to that time to look at later. his wife, who had been a police counsellor up to that time helped his wife, who had been a police counsellor up to that time to them from the folder. After his wife, who had been a police counsellor up to that time had left, the teacher in charge of the class and myself as the principal discovered that the teacher in charge of the class had also taken away a journal of an actual lesson, in which we had dealt with an article from the “Jüdische Rundschau” newspaper. the “Jüdische Rundschau” newspaper was banned for three months on account of an article from the “Jüdische Rundschau” newspaper. This led us to fear for several months, that we would be arrested. Whenever myself as the principal went over a subject with the schoolgirls, which was contrary to the Nazi ethos, myself as the principal always had another book at hand, in order to change topics in the event of an unannounced inspection. the schoolgirls were not permitted to discuss politics amongst the schoolgirls. Nonetheless word went round the school that one of the schoolgirls had spent a year in jail as a Communist. Although this fact, which myself as the principal had not been aware of beforehand, gravely endangered the seminar, myself as the principal let one of the girls stay in the seminar but made one of the girls's promise to keep away from political circles in future. A short time later one of the girls came to myself as the principal with another classmate, and reported that both these girls belonged to a secret communist organisation; both these girls had been to a meeting there and the premises of a secret communist organisation had been searched the following day. Letters and other correspondence of both these girls had been at that location. Once again this endangered the seminar, and myself as the principal. However nothing came of it. One day a policeman turned up in myself as the principal's office, to rebuke myself as the principal very energetically for arranging that final year schoolgirls were being placed in Jewish families and institutions. A new law had very recently come into force, that stated that Jewish girls too were to acquire work only through permitted official agencies. The Jewish commune - 3 - The Jewish commune appeared to be as much in the dark about A new law as myself as the principal was. a policeman stayed with myself as the principal for around an hour, questioned myself as the principal in every way possible and assured myself as the principal, that myself as the principal would doubtless be in line for a hefty fine or probably even a prison sentence. a policeman came back next [illegible] day to question myself as the principal's secretary intensively. This event too came to nothing. the seminar had to move out of the apartment in the autumn of 1938; no other premises could be found and so the seminar was incorporated into the Jewish school on the Kaiserdamm. myself as the principal closed the seminar on 1.3.1939, because not only most of the teaching staff, but the schoolgirls too, had emigrated. myself as the principal's own emigration, which was planned for the middle of March, was delayed by myself as the principal's illness. myself as the principal was lying in the Jewish hospital in Berlin because of a heart condition, which had come on suddenly and which the doctors diagnosed as being caused by all the commotions; myself as the principal lay there right up until myself as the principal flew to Berlin in May 1939. It was not until after the war that myself as the principal was able to settle down to becoming a writer. - 4 - In the early days of the Nazi era the head of myself as the principal's the private nursery, which the head of my the private nursery, which she had taken over as my successor in 1930 had taken over as myself as the principal's successor in 1930, was in anguish because the Jewish children, whilst out on the Jewish children's walks, had started to sing Nazi songs or to call out “Heil Hitler”. Some time in That same year myself as the principal was visited by Hanno Günther, who was about 12 years old at the time, and who had been a former Christian child in myself as the principal's nursery. Hanno Günther, who was about 12 years old at the time, and who had been a former Christian child in my nursery came to myself as the principal to mention that Hanno Günther, who was about 12 years old at the time, and who had been a former Christian child in my nursery had joined the Hitler Youth, and that Hanno Günther, who was about 12 years old at the time, and who had been a former Christian child in my nursery didn’t want myself as the principal to hear about the Hitler Youth from anyone else. There was no conscription yet at That same year. myself as the principal found it quite astonishing, considering that Hanno Günther, who was about 12 years old at the time, and who had been a former Christian child in my nursery came from a household which leaned radically to the left. In answer to myself as the principal's question of why Hanno Günther, who was about 12 years old at the time, and who had been a former Christian child in my nursery had done this, Hanno Günther, who was about 12 years old at the time, and who had been a former Christian child in my nursery replied: Hanno Günther, who was about 12 years old at the time, and who had been a former Christian child in my nursery am doing this in order to disseminate Communist propaganda! The Nazis shot Hanno Günther, who was about 12 years old at the time, and who had been a former Christian child in my nursery dead when Hanno Günther, who was about 12 years old at the time, and who had been a former Christian child in my nursery was 21 years old. In That same year or 35 myself as the principal bumped into the daughter-in-law of General Feldmarschall v. der Goltz in the street; the daughter-in-law of General Feldmarschall v. der Goltz in the street's son had been at myself as the principal's nursery. Although a lot of people were passing by, the daughter-in-law of General Feldmarschall v. der Goltz in the street began to shout out abuse about Hitler and The Nazis. myself as the principal soon curtailed the discussion by remarking that myself as the principal had no wish to put myself as the principal in any kind of danger. Up until myself as the principal's emigration in That same year {[illegible]} myself as the principal's childhood girlfriends, Kleckels, (officers of daughters) stayed the same, my childhood girlfriends, Kleckels, (officers of daughters) visited myself as the principal and invited me[illegible]. There were other Jews too who continued to visit there on a regular basis. Although other Jews too who continued to visit there on a regular basis were employed as female officials, other Jews too who continued to visit there on a regular basis still visited myself as the principal in the Jewish hospital in Berlin in That same year and, when myself as the principal emigrated a short time afterwards, other Jews too who continued to visit there on a regular basis came to see myself as the principal off at the airport. One of other Jews too who continued to visit there on a regular basis even had to take special leave for this purpose, apparently she did so by stating the real reason in her request for absence. myself as the principal's writing activities had stopped by That same year, except for the publishing house of Vobach, where they kept myself as the principal on. myself as the principal was employed there on a fixed salary and continued to deliver a number of articles for women's periodicals, and myself as the principal attended any preliminary talks in the editorial office. myself as the principal kept a number of articles for women's periodicals very neutral, nevertheless a number of articles for women's periodicals were seldom printed. Following a dictation from above, myself as the principal met with the female editor, Miss Krähe, outside the publishing house of Vobach, where they kept me on in a small vacant coffeecafé in 1934. That editor, who was normally over familiar, was very uneasy this time, the female editor, Miss Krähe was constantly looking around anxiously and myself as the principal noticed from the female editor, Miss Krähe's demeanour how unhappy the female editor, Miss Krähe was in having to follow the instruction to meet myself as the principal. After that myself as the principal resigned from any further cooperation. In April That same year myself as the principal had to hand in a book manuscript to the publishing house of Thienemann in Stuttgart, which of course myself as the principal did not do. Shortly after the end of the war in 1945 myself as the principal was asked to send in a book manuscript, however, the only remaining copy had been burnt in a suitcase in the meantime. - 5 - When The Nazis burnt the books from Freud’s publishing house (Intl. psychoanalytical publ. in Vienna) myself as the principal's book “Psychoanalysis and Nurseries” was amongst The Nazis. When myself as the principal learnt of this fact later on in Berlin, myself as the principal felt a certain amount of pride that I too had been part of that circle. During myself as the principal's studies and myself as the principal's later membership in the Berlin group of the Intl. Psychoan. Soc., most of the analysts were Jews. The Berlin group of the was the scientific society, which, for a very long time indeed, resisted pressure from The Nazis to exclude Jews, with the result that The Berlin group of the continued to work together for longer than elsewhere was the case, albeit there were hardly any Jewish psychoanalysts left in Berlin at all. As soon as the possibility of Jews joining The Berlin group of the ceased to exist, Dr. Boehm, the Aryan chairman at the time, let us come to see Dr. Boehm, the Aryan chairman at the time on an individual basis, in order to discuss this state of affairs. myself as the principal found the discussion with Dr. Boehm, the Aryan chairman at the time about the suspension of work an unforgettable, earnest moment, Dr. Boehm, the Aryan chairman at the time was so full of a respectful, deeply sympathetic attitude, that myself as the principal hold Dr. Boehm, the Aryan chairman at the time in myself as the principal's memory as a shining beacon, in stark contrast to the suppression of the Nazi era. Shortly after the suspension of work myself as the principal had many telephone calls and visits from doctors (psychiatrists), who offered to buy myself as the principal's psychoanalytic magazines and books from myself as the principal. In spite of the extremely generous offers of payment myself as the principal never trusted myself as the principal to take up doctors (psychiatrists), who offered to buy my psychoanalytic magazines and books from me's offers. When in 1934 myself as the principal wanted to start myself as the principal's nursery seminar in partnership with the Jewish commune, myself as the principal got in touch with the provost of the Pestalozzi-Froebel-Haus (Lilly Droescher) for a meeting, which the provost of the Pestalozzi-Froebel-Haus (Lilly Droescher) offered myself as the principal most willingly. myself as the principal still felt closely tied to the Pestalozzi-Froebel-Haus and didn’t want to open my nursery seminar, before myself as the principal [illegible] had announced my nursery seminar; especially since myself as the principal had always fought so hard to date as a (board) member of the Kindergaertnerischen Berufsorginasation Privat-Seminare (Private Seminars of the Organisation of Nurseries) against private seminars. the provost of the Pestalozzi-Froebel-Haus (Lilly Droescher) supported the planned work strongly and lent myself as the principal lesson plans and similar material so that myself as the principal could get myself as the principal ready. - 6 - myself as the principal recall two meetings. In 1933 myself as the principal encountered {encountered} a female teacher from the Pestalozzi{-} Froebel-Haus, Miss Corvinus, on the street and had intended to pass a female teacher from the Pestalozzi{-} Froebel-Haus, Miss Corvinus, on the street by. a female teacher from the Pestalozzi{-} Froebel-Haus, Miss Corvinus, on the street, however, stood still, shook myself as the principal's hand as if a female teacher from the Pestalozzi{-} Froebel-Haus, Miss Corvinus, on the street were offering myself as the principal a female teacher from the Pestalozzi{-} Froebel-Haus, Miss Corvinus, on the street's condolences, and we chatted for some considerable time; likewise myself as the principal's encounter with the head of the Augusta Victoria children’s hospital in Charlottenburg, who myself as the principal knew from lectures myself as the principal had held there. the head of the Augusta Victoria children’s hospital in Charlottenburg, who I knew from lectures I had held there too exhibited friendliness towards myself as the principal. It didn’t go the same way with the chairwoman of the Professional Organisation of Female Nursery Staff. We had met up at meetings over many years and myself as the principal had been to the chairwoman of the Professional Organisation of Female Nursery Staff's house in the town of Roda in Thuringia several times, in order to report for the newspapers on the social facilities the chairwoman of the Professional Organisation of Female Nursery Staff was in charge of. When myself as the principal wrote to the chairwoman of the Professional Organisation of Female Nursery Staff in 1939 before myself as the principal's emigration, myself as the principal asked the chairwoman of the Professional Organisation of Female Nursery Staff to confirm to myself as the principal that we were still working together; the chairwoman of the Professional Organisation of Female Nursery Staff didn’t just deny that but the chairwoman of the Professional Organisation of Female Nursery Staff also passed it over to the chairwoman of the Professional Organisation of Female Nursery Staff's secretary to write myself as the principal a frosty response. myself as the principal wish to add the following announcement as a postscript to myself as the principal's seminar project: in That same year myself as the principal was required, as a result of a recent edict, to expel a “half-Aryan girl” six months before a “half-Aryan girl” took a “half-Aryan girl”'s exams; this was because The Nazis had suddenly decreed that such girls were no longer permitted to attend a Jewish seat of learning. The following may be of interest: myself as the principal wanted to move into a new seminar apartment in That same year. myself as the principal went to see the landlord of a new seminar apartment at 94 Wilmersdorfer Strasse in order to discuss the matter and finalise the contract. During this discussion the landlord of the house at 94 Wilmersdorfer Strasse put down a wrong date when drawing up the contract. myself as the principal objected, saying that the landlord of the house at 94 Wilmersdorfer Strasse might have made a mistake; the landlord of the house at 94 Wilmersdorfer Strasse dismissed a mistake with a wave of the landlord of the house at 94 Wilmersdorfer Strasse's hand and ignored a mistake. myself as the principal suspected something was afoot and when myself as the principal went to put myself as the principal's signature to the contract, myself as the principal took along a witness, Dr. Koehne, a lawyer whom myself as the principal had befriended. a witness, Dr. Koehne, a lawyer whom I had befriended insisted that the correct date should be entered and explained to myself as the principal afterwards, why the correct date was that the landlord of the house had wanted to do that. myself as the principal no longer recall the reason; myself as the principal only remember that (in doing so) the landlord of the house wished to bypass a legal decree. - When myself as the principal was given notice to leave the seminar premises in 1938 (or 1937), myself as the principal was asked to come to the lettings agency from one day to the next. myself as the principal was unable to - 7 - find anyone at short notice, who could accompany myself as the principal as a witness at the appropriate time. As a result myself as the principal was shaking as myself as the principal entered the “lion’s den”, a room in which there were a lot of Nazis sitting at a lot of Nazis's typewriters, eyeing myself as the principal suspiciously. The “gentleman” whose job it was to negotiate with myself as the principal now wanted to persuade myself as the principal to admit that the date myself as the principal had given as correct at the time, was in fact a mistake, and if myself as the principal did that, then myself as the principal could keep the accommodation. Of course myself as the principal didn’t do as The “gentleman” whose job it was to negotiate with me asked and myself as the principal left the room {under} threats from the Nazi side. the seminar was then transferred to the Theodor Herzl school, where myself as the principal had been provided with some rooms. From 1932 - 39 myself as the principal had an Aryan housekeeper, who remained loyal to myself as the principal until myself as the principal's departure, and an Aryan housekeeper, who remained loyal to me until my departure continues to write to myself as the principal to this day, saying that an Aryan housekeeper, who remained loyal to me until my departure spent the happiest days of an Aryan housekeeper, who remained loyal to me until my departure's life in myself as the principal's house. myself as the principal have to admit, however, that myself as the principal found it unpleasant, that an Aryan housekeeper, who remained loyal to me until my departure's son-in-law was a professed Nazi; her son-in-law went in and out of myself as the principal's apartment and myself as the principal's friends never ceased to warn myself as the principal about her son-in-law.

,"['One of the very few survivors reports on the transport of 7,000 Jews from Baden and Pfalz to Gurs, France, and describes in detail the abominable conditions of the camp and the enormous death rate in consequence of starvation and diseases. A very small number of prisoners who succeeded to get the entry-permit to the USA were transferred from Gurs, France to the Camp des Milles near Marseilles and some of A very small number of prisoners who succeeded to get the entry-permit to the USA were indeed able to escape. The rest of A very small number of prisoners who succeeded to get the entry-permit to the USA were sent to annihilation camps when the Germans took over in 1942. P.III.h. (Gurs, France) No. 284 On 21 October 1940 around 7000 Jews from Baden and Pfalz were “abruptly deported to the camp at Gurs, France.” This is a description of it by someone who was there. “Jews of Platform 2: close the doors, the train is leaving.” As long as I live these terrible words, bellowed at us through the loudspeaker in Karlsruhe central station on 21 October 1940, will ring in my ears. In the train, huddled a group of dispossessed and persecuted German Jews, mainly children and the elderly. a group of dispossessed and persecuted German Jews, mainly children and the elderly had had to endure seven years of persecution, but what was happening today was the hardest thing of all to comprehend. This morning a group of dispossessed and persecuted German Jews, mainly children and the elderly had been taken from a group of dispossessed and persecuted German Jews, mainly children and the elderly's homes by the SA[1] and the police. a group of dispossessed and persecuted German Jews, mainly children and the elderly had to leave everything behind and were not permitted to take anything with a group of dispossessed and persecuted German Jews, mainly children and the elderly apart from a small suitcase and 100 Marks. A short time later a group of dispossessed and persecuted German Jews, mainly children and the elderly were standing at the station, the weaker ones intimidated, and those who still retained those who still retained their sense of self-respect after 7 years of repression's sense of self-respect after 7 years of repression fuming with rage. a group of dispossessed and persecuted German Jews, mainly children and the elderly were forced to go past a notary who presented a group of dispossessed and persecuted German Jews, mainly children and the elderly with a pre-prepared document for signature. a group of dispossessed and persecuted German Jews, mainly children and the elderly never found out what a group of dispossessed and persecuted German Jews, mainly children and the elderly were signing. On Platform II the SA[1] patrolled with submachine guns, ready to shoot anyone who tried to put up any resistance. The people sat squashed together and with guards in every carriage. The people did not know where The people were going, whether west or east. The people knew only one thing, The people were travelling into a grim future of deprivation and probably death. the train rolled on towards Freiburg im Breisgau, then over the Rhine and towards Gurs, France - Gurs, France Castle. I remembered bitterly how I had travelled the same route the other way 22 years earlier. At that time I was positioned in front of Gurs, France during the First World War, the castle that we never reached. The railway line which I had observed so often through the twin-telescope and had ordered the artillery to fire at, The railway line which I had observed so often through the twin-telescope and had ordered the artillery to fire at today was the route through which my own people were throwing me out of my own people's country. A loudspeaker bellowed again and threatened to shoot anyone who had more than 100 Marks with anyone who had more than 100 Marks with them. the train rolled on. Next to me sat an old man, brooding over something. Suddenly an old man gave me a screwed-up paper and asked me to throw a screwed-up paper out of the window. A few minutes later an old man began talking to me: “Do you know what you threw out of the window just now? It was the last of an old man's savings, two thousand Marks. an old man’m finally rid of a screwed-up paper. an old man didn’t want to give a screwed-up paper to the SA[1]. Now an old man have nothing left.” For three days the train stopped and started, until the train finally halted at a small station near the Pyrenees. It was pouring with rain and we soon learned that it only ever rained in a small station near the Pyrenees. Day or night, it rained and rained. We had come to that part of France which was popularly called the “Urinoire de France”.[2] Some old and ramshackle open trucks stood there. Like cattle we were loaded onto Some old and ramshackle open trucks uncovered and, in the pouring rain, were driven at breakneck speed to somewhere which would go down in the history of the Baden Jews as a terrible place and would become the Baden Jews's fate. “Camp de Gurs”, the sorriest and most run-down place which was ever created for man. Dirty, unsanitary, a place to die, but not a place to live. somewhere which would go down in the history of the Baden Jews as a terrible place and would become their fate had originally been a barracks which years before had been built by Spanish soldiers who had crossed over into France. Like us, somewhere which would go down in the history of the Baden Jews as a terrible place and would become their fate had been driven out of Spanish soldiers who had crossed over into France's country, however most of somewhere which would go down in the history of the Baden Jews as a terrible place and would become their fate had succeeded in going on to Mexico. A minority were still there. A minority had partitioned off a small section of the camp for A minority and worked during the day on the land for the local farmers. The empty part of the camp had been left to crumble and rot. a small section of the camp was now destined to be the future residence of people who had done no wrong and whose own country had thrown people who had done no wrong and whose own country had thrown them out purely for the accident of their birth out purely for the accident of people who had done no wrong and whose own country had thrown them out purely for the accident of their birth's birth. First the little luggage that people who had done no wrong and whose own country had thrown them out purely for the accident of their birth had brought with people who had done no wrong and whose own country had thrown them out purely for the accident of their birth was thrown altogether into a heap in the quagmire at the entrance to the camp. It rained continuously on the quagmire at the entrance to the camp until the suitcases were ruined and what few possessions people who had done no wrong and whose own country had thrown them out purely for the accident of their birth thought people who had done no wrong and whose own country had thrown them out purely for the accident of their birth had managed to save were ruined along with people who had done no wrong and whose own country had thrown them out purely for the accident of their birth. The new arrivals were driven first behind the barbed wire fence where like cattle The new arrivals were turned loose. In the following - and for many the last - period in people who had done no wrong and whose own country had thrown them out purely for the accident of their birth's lives people who had done no wrong and whose own country had thrown them out purely for the accident of their birth had to fend for people who had done no wrong and whose own country had thrown them out purely for the accident of their birth. the camp consisted of a large number of wooden barracks which were already semi-collapsed. The rain poured incessantly through the damaged roofs. Although there was actually some old electric wiring, there was no electricity. a large number of wooden barracks which were already semi-collapsed had no windows, just wooden shutters. So people had to choose whether to close just wooden shutters and be in the dark, or open just wooden shutters and let in the cold and rain. Inside, a large number of wooden barracks which were already semi-collapsed had only a dirty wooden floor. Nothing else. a large number of wooden barracks which were already semi-collapsed were empty. No chair, no table, nothing that could pass for a bed. For the first nights we simply had to sleep on the floor. And because we spent the whole day on our feet and got tired, we had to lie on the floor during the whole day too. In this way we became more and more like animals. After a few days we eventually got straw to lie on. The sick and elderly also later got bedsteads. Anyone who got one of bedsteads felt like a privileged person of means. We never got chairs and tables. If you wanted to write, all you could do was lie flat on your stomach on the floor with your paper. One day we suddenly heard: the luggage is being distributed. What arrived beggared belief. The suitcases had gone soft from the wet and mostly broke apart when you tried to lift The suitcases. Everything that could absorb water was soaked through and, if you couldn’t wash Everything that could absorb water, unusable. The unpacking revealed what ridiculous things people had packed in people's panic-stricken rush. One man found a drinks service in One man's luggage, another had twelve hats. However, there was a general lack of anything that might have been of any use in these circumstances. Over time we got food in very limited quantity and of very limited quality. Mostly food in very limited quantity and of very limited quality consisted of half-rotten Jerusalem artichokes, a plant similar to potatoes, mostly used in animal feed. the camp no longer had a kitchen, so we had no choice but to turn a former laundry into one. Old dirty laundry boilers were roughly cleaned the best you could with just water and made into makeshift pots to use for cooking. There was absolutely no running water, but only an open channel. Empty food tins were pushed into each other once the bottoms had been removed and Empty food tins then became the camp's water pipeline. The sanitary arrangements, or rather the lack of The sanitary arrangements, can hardly be described. The sanitary arrangements consisted of the rail, familiar to wartime soldiers, on a raised platform. Barrels below. the camp streets were like a swamp because of the constant rain. Older people hardly risked leaving Older people's barracks because Older people's shoes often got stuck in the mud. Many caught pneumonia this way from which they then died. No wonder in these circumstances that illness and death soon took hold. There were some doctors among the camp inmates but some doctors among the camp inmates were could do nothing without medication and instruments. This meant that getting ill meant certain death. The most terrible thing about the way the French treated us was that the French didn’t treat us in any way. The French camp administrators couldn’t have cared less about the inmates. They The French camp administrators did not get much to eat and therefore The French camp administrators took for The French camp administrators part of the little food designated for the camp. There was still a small cemetery from the time the French had been there. There were only about 5-10 graves in a small cemetery from the time the Spanish had been there. There were about that many new graves now daily. a small cemetery from the time the Spanish had been there expanded with appalling speed, and after a year contained over 500 graves. Pneumonia and dysentery carried people off quickly. Death claimed the most victims from among the children. During the children's growing years the children were the ones who probably needed suitable nourishment to aid the children's growth. the children were least able to withstand undernourishment. Adults were already losing around 30 lbs in weight within a month. So it was little wonder that a cart came daily to collect the dead. Only after many months of tenacious efforts the prospect beckoned for a few to emigrate to the USA. They were transferred to a camp near Marseilles (Camp des Milles), but only some of them were actually able to escape France at the last minute. In autumn 1942 German occupied Southern France too and from that point everyone was lost. They were transported back through German by their erstwhile German countrymen and gassed in the East. Only a few made it through this horror and are still alive today. What they have survived will live with them forever. No reparation will ever bring back to life those who have been tortured to death.

,"['When ordered to join the army, the author’s husband, a Jew and known to be politically on the left side, was sent to a “Strafkompanie” at the Ukrainian front. The commander of the labour camp was Colonel Muray, later sentenced to death and executed (Nagykata). At the end of the war, the Jewish workers were shot by the Germans in order to prevent the Jewish workers from joining the Germans (p.1). Generally the author’s faced no active persecution during the year 1943 (p.2). From the date of the German occupation (19 March 1944) there was methodical persecution, getting worse as the war went on, especially from 15 October 1944, after an attempt of a separate peace-treaty had failed (p.2). Non-Jews helping Jews (p.2-3, 6). the author’s went into hiding provided with false documents, was found out and arrested. Atrocious examinations at the Pfeilkreuzler Headquarters, (p3-6) Andrassy Str. 60 (p.3-4). Innumerable Jews were killed there after terrible ill-treatment (p.5). One of the Pfeilkreuzlers, Parkany Rudolf, rescued many Jews from the worst; at One of the Pfeilkreuzlers, Parkany Rudolf,'s trial, after the liberation, One of the Pfeilkreuzlers, Parkany Rudolf, was acquitted on the strength of their evidence (p.5-6). The Pfeilkreuzler at the Pfeilkreuzler Headquarters who had been so brave in The Pfeilkreuzler at the Headquarters who had been so brave in their struggle with the Jews's struggle with the Jews panicked at the news of the Russian approach, in Christmas 1944; the author’s escaped in the confusion, (p.6). Completely destitute, the author’s had to retreat, as before, to the house under Swedish protection in Tatra Utca, but the author’s still would be searched by Pfeilkreuzlers, who went on deporting and murdering Jews on the plea of being in possession of forged Schutzpässe (p.2, 7). They took the author’s together with many others to the already overcrowded Ghetto (p.7-9), from which the Russians liberated the surviving internees nearly frozen and starved, on 18 January 1945. As a Prisoner in the Headquarters of the Hungarian Fascists mine's suffering began in 1942. Until then, my husband and I had; mine's husband and mine, lived as a happily married young Jewish couple in Budapest. Even the outbreak of the war, initially, had little effect upon my husband and I. mine's husband had a good job as Head of Department within the major ‘Tungsram’ factory, a business concerned in the production of electrical appliances of all manner and, in particular, light-bulbs. However, in Spring 1942, my husband was called-up into military service. As a Jew, my husband went to one of the infamous labour companies and as my husband was, moreover, regarded as having politically left-wing views, my husband was put into one of the particular companies, which were located in Nagykata close to Budapest and from there sent directly to the Ukraine and employed in the hardest labour close behind the front. the infamous labour companies were regarded as penal battalions. Only some very few of the infamous labour companies's number returned alive after the infamous labour companies's unending suffering. Most fell victim to the stresses and strains, to the inhuman treatment, hunger and frost in the Ukrainian Steppes and on the battlefields of the Woronesch. The Kommandant of Nagykata close to Budapest and from there sent directly to the Ukraine and employed in the hardest labour close behind the front and the Head of the organisation of the infamous labour companies was a certain Colonel Muray, a beast in human form…., a man who participated personally in the abuse of his unfortunate victims and who had countless lives on his conscience. He was sentenced to death as a war criminal and publicly executed in Budapest. Initially, mine received news from mine's husband at regular intervals via military post; later this became ever more seldom. The last one, mine received around Christmas. After The last one, mine only received a bland official announcement that my husband was listed as missing. Never was mine able to establish anything certain about my husband's fate. mine heard from one of the few survivors that the Germans had shot mine's husband and many of my husband's comrades dead to stop the Germans going over to the Germans. - 2 - mine continued to live, for the meantime, in my husband and I's apartment in Damjanich Street and had, naturally, not given up hope that mine would one day see mine's husband alive again. The factory where my husband had worked continued to pay mine my husband's salary, so that mine was, at least, safe from material need. the Ukraine also remained, in general, free of anti-semitic operations throughout 1943. But, on the 19th March 1944, the Germans occupied the Ukraine and a new period of suffering began for my husband and I. my husband and I had to wear the Star of David. Numerous exceptional laws affected my husband and I. Many of mine's friends and relatives were interned or deported. When the decree was passed that Budapest Jews, individually, mark the door of the homes with a large yellow star- so-called Jewish houses, mine was quite lucky, when the house in Damjanich Street, where mine resided, was declared to be one of these ‘Jewish houses’. However, when, after the 15th October, the date of the failed Hungarian attempt at a special peace, the situation worsened and the terror against the Jews was increased, mine's residence there was also no more. For my husband and I, an agonising migration from place to place commenced.., from one place of refuge to another. Initially, mine was accommodated in a house under Swedish diplomatic protection in Tetra Street. It soon became clear, however, that this ‘protection’ was very problematic, for the ever wilder and increasingly fanatical gesturing Hungarian Nazis, the so-called ‘Crossed-Arrows’, no longer concerned the ever wilder and increasingly fanatical gesturing Hungarian Nazis, the so-called ‘Crossed-Arrows with diplomatic papers or promises and brought the Jews out of these ‘houses of protection’. Every persecuted Jew, which only a few were able to, acquired false personal documents at this time. In mine's haste and desperation, mine also tried to do this. mine remember a Christian man, whom mine had known beforehand, of whom mine knew that the gentleman concerned was sympathetic towards Jews and actually stated the gentleman concerned was ready to help mine. the gentleman concerned gave mine the papers of the gentleman concerned's former, now divorced, wife. his former, now divorced, wife's age and other particulars corresponded roughly to mine and, in this way; mine could appear as a Christian under this name. It was a very daring act on the part of the gentleman concerned and it would later condemn us both to prison. But, for the moment, mine had, in any case, been saved. mine disappeared from Tetra Street and appeared in the suburb of Buda under mine's new name, where mine rented a small, furnished room and, with the help of the false documents, lived a few weeks unchallenged. - 3 - The situation became ever more critical. mine felt mine's life threatened; mine dared venture onto the streets and it seemed to mine that mine's next door neighbour observed mine from day to day with ever-growing mistrust. Again, mine sought the advice and help of mine's Christian acquaintance and my next door neighbour prepared mine for hiding in a provincial town, where mine was to live with my next door neighbour's distant relatives in even greater seclusion and safety until the Russian troops moved in. No sooner had mine packed mine's bags, as one day, it must have been two weeks before Christmas, the catastrophe occurred. mine sat late in the evening in mine's meagre little room and ate mine's measly evening meal, when there was a violent knock at the door. Expecting nothing good, mine opened the door. The late visit came from two adolescents with crossed-arrows on two adolescents with crossed-arrows on their armbands and machine-guns slung on their backs's armbands and machine-guns slung on two adolescents with crossed-arrows on their armbands and machine-guns slung on their backs's backs. Without further explanation, two adolescents with crossed-arrows on their armbands and machine-guns slung on their backs this unfriendly demand that mine go with two adolescents with crossed-arrows on their armbands and machine-guns slung on their backs immediately. Terror struck mine to the bones, so that mine could hardly ask or reply to anything. There was nothing left for mine but to obey this unfriendly demand. Shivering with fear and from frost, mine staggered through the night-filled street, escorted by mine's two unsolicited companions. Our path, initially, led to Horthy-Miklos Street[1], where the fascist gang had furnished a building as a so-called ‘Crossed-Arrows House’, one of the many terror quarters in the Ukraine. mine was, there, immediately put under sharp cross-examination and said, off the top of mine's head, that mine was a Jew who had gone ‘underground’ with false papers. mine stuck to mine's version and denied everything. Yet, from the questions directed at mine and from the gang’s behaviour as a whole, mine was able to assume that someone must have denounced mine and mine's Christian acquaintance. It was also explained to mine, and it was later proved true, that mine's acquaintance had, likewise, been arrested. During the very same night, mine was transported onwards. This time, mine was taken directly to the Headquarters of the Crossed-Arrows in the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2]. the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] was formerly a peaceful, silent building on the Ukraine's main-road. Now, the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] buzzed with figures in fantastic weapon-laden uniforms. At the entrance and in the stairwell, machine-guns were visible; in the corridors and passages armed members of the Crossed-Arrows hastened busily to and fro. Despite the advanced hour, the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] was filled with cries and noise. - 4 - mine was taken into a room and surrendered mine for interrogation to a man, who, as a result of a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear's rabid external appearance and a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear's uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled mine with fear. interrogation commenced with the vilest of insults; a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear shouted at mine that mine's acquaintance had already admitted everything and a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear announced that mine would survive the night. As mine ventured, again and again, to assert mine's innocence and begged a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear to let mine go, a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear began to beat mine and kick mine in the body with a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear's boots. Finally, a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear pointed a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear's revolver directly at mine, sometimes at mine's head, sometimes at mine's chest. “If mine are a good Christian…, then say the Lord’s Prayer! Say mine's last rites, before a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear shoot mine!” mine believed everything to be lost and finally confessed that mine's papers were false and that mine had been in hiding. In mine's fear and horror, mine confessed to everything a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear wanted…, even to such things as mine’d not done! Each time mine's tongue failed mine, a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear poked mine with the butt of a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear's pistol once more between mine's ribs and mine believed that mine's last moments had come. Finally, a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear let up on mine and ordered mine to stand against the wall with mine's face turned away and, there, to remain standing motionless. At the slightest move a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear would shoot mine mercilessly dead. For a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear's part, a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear made a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear comfortable on a sofa. mine was so taken with all the horror and cruelty of those hours mine’d lived through, that mine dared not move.., in addition to the approaching heavy footsteps in the corridor outside and the noises of mine's companions. Finally, shocked by the thought that a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear would awaken and a man, who, as a result of his rabid external appearance and his uninterrupted fumbling with a revolver, filled me with fear's threats would come to fruition, mine sank down against the wall and spent the rest on the night in leaden apathy, curled up on the floor. Morning came. Other members of the Crossed-Arrows came into the room creating a noise and howling. mine was, once more, insulted, pulled up by mine's hair and pushed this way and that. Finally, mine was allowed to sit in a chair. Later, mine's tormentors disappeared and a man dressed in civilian clothes appeared, who described a man dressed in civilian clothes as the Investigating Magistrate. a man dressed in civilian clothes spoke in a calm tone to mine and took a form of minutes to our meeting. As we were both alone for a few moments in the room, a man dressed in civilian clothes gave mine the impression, with a man dressed in civilian clothes's carefully chosen words, that a man dressed in civilian clothes did not approve of the behaviour of the Crossed-Arrows and that a man dressed in civilian clothes wanted to rescue mine. a man dressed in civilian clothes did not know how it could be made possible. In any case, a man dressed in civilian clothes would not allow mine to be taken to the cellar, where the other prisoners were and, as for the other prisoners, a very sad fate awaited the other prisoners. - 5 - To this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany, mine, as well as many other of mine's comrades in fate, have much to thank, that my husband and I were able to escape the hell of the Crossed-Arrows headquarters. this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany did what was within this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany's power to save as many victims of the gang’s as possible. Of course, this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany could not prevent that from the cellar of the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] many unfortunate people were taken by the Crossed-Arrows after serious maltreatment to the banks of Tatra Utca and murdered, as this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany would have made this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany conspicuous, perhaps, affecting this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany's life. this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany was, later, put before court, like many of the Crossed-Arrows after the liberation. As, however, many witnesses, amongst whom was mine, gave evidence in this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany's favour and it was perfectly well proven, that this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany had sabotaged operations of the fascist criminals and had saved many people, this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany was found not guilty. mine remained, for the next few days, in the headquarters of the Crossed-Arrows, but was not taken to the cellar of the house. mine can say exactly how long mine spent in the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2]. mine could have been ten, twelve or, perhaps, even as long as fourteen days, but, under the influence of the terrible scenes, which mine experienced on a daily basis and had to witness, all measure of time was finally lost to mine. Daily, Jews of every age and sex were brought in groups of prisoners into the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2], interrogated, maltreated, bloodily beaten, hauled onwards or locked in the cellar of the house. One of the main pleasures of the Crossed-Arrows involved standing groups of prisoners facing the wall and then shooting into the air behind groups of prisoners's backs, or even throwing knives into the wall close to the heads of those frightened to death. In many cases, however, those frightened to death really were struck or seriously injured. Whosoever fell to the ground or collapsed unconscious were worked upon with rubber bludgeons and then dragged to the cellar. There, all prisoners were seriously maltreated by the other Crossed-Arrows. The cries of pain of those being tortured rang out through the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2]. mine, mine, and some other Jewish women, who were brought in as prisoners, remained on the upper stories and were required to perform the most menial of duties. mine had to polish the boots of the Crossed-Arrows, wash the Crossed-Arrows's dirty linen, clean the floors, which was often enough reddened with the blood of mine's tortured comrades. In doing this, mine was exposed to the constant maltreatment meted out by the gang’s, was compelled to work and suffered beatings and kickings. mine was continually threatened with being killed on the spot. mine was also incessantly shouted at with the vilest and most common abuse. The great majority of the Crossed-Arrows, whom mine saw, were made up of adolescents, who made mine the target of adolescents, who made me the target of their brutal fun's brutal fun. mine's food consisted of watery soup, or from what mine could acquire in unguarded moments. When mine's tormentors sat at my two unsolicited companions's richly laid tables, one or other of my two unsolicited companions would sometimes throw mine a morsel like one does to a dog. On Christmas Eve, a panic flared up in the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2]. With lightning speed, the news spread that Russian troops had encircled the Ukraine and had already penetrated into some parts of the Ukraine. Russian tanks were reported to have been seen in the outer quarters. It was expected that Russian tanks would penetrate further inwards. All of the Crossed-Arrows, who had, hitherto, demonstrated All of the Crossed-Arrows, who had, hitherto, demonstrated themselves to be so courageous against their defenceless and unprotected victims to be so courageous against All of the Crossed-Arrows, who had, hitherto, demonstrated themselves to be so courageous against their defenceless and unprotected victims's defenceless and unprotected victims, succumbed now to great fear. All of the Crossed-Arrows, who had, hitherto, demonstrated themselves to be so courageous against their defenceless and unprotected victims ran excitedly through the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] searching for All of the Crossed-Arrows, who had, hitherto, demonstrated themselves to be so courageous against their defenceless and unprotected victims's civilian wardrobe. Many fled, having lost their heads, through the outer passages. Parkany appeared and called out to mine that mine should make mine scarce, as the main entrance was unguarded. mine couldn’t believe mine's ears.., yet, went into the stairwell and spied down. mine saw general panic and uproar; the guards had disappeared; no-one concerned the guards with anyone else. mine summoned up all mine's courage and rushed; dodged through the crowds, past the gate and disappeared outside onto the dark street. As fast as mine's feet could carry mine, mine rushed into mine's old apartment in Damjanich Street, where mine arrived totally exhausted and close to collapse. The block, as well as mine's apartment, was packed with strangers. mine's situation was desperate, as mine had lost all of mine's possessions, including mine's clothes and washing in various places, where mine had recently been dragged from here to there. The remainder had been confiscated upon arrest in Buda by the Crossed-Arrows, which, putting it better, had been stolen and, upon mine's escape from the headquarters, mine hadn’t even put on mine's winter coat, but had so much as got up and left. Now, mine stood in mine's only clothes. mine found out that mine's Christian acquaintance, who had acquired false papers for mine and was later arrested, had, likewise, escaped, but was in such an abused state that my Christian acquaintance, who had acquired false papers for me and was later arrested had to go to hospital. my Christian acquaintance, who had acquired false papers for me and was later arrested could obviously not assist mine. my Christian acquaintance, who had acquired false papers for me and was later arrested's only home had been completely looted, with this hoard were several of mine's bags and valuables, which mine had stored there for reasons of safety and had now disappeared. mine stood there with absolutely nothing. - 6 - A compassionate soul in Damjanich Street gave mine, at least, a few clean clothes. Dressed as such, mine made mine's way, the next day, to the safe house in Tatra Street, where mine met, once more, with a few acquaintances and, for the next few days, was protected from the worst. Coming from the street, we could hear the hail of canons and the noise of battle. The Russians were only a few kilometres away from us and The Russians came ever nearer with each day.., yet, for many of us, much too slowly. The diplomatic protection, which we were supposed to enjoy in this house in Tatra Street proved to be illusory. Almost every day, armed gangs of Crossed-Arrows appeared in the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2]. Sometimes, we succeeded in placating armed gangs of Crossed-Arrows with bribes and to make armed gangs of Crossed-Arrows withdraw. Mostly, however, armed gangs of Crossed-Arrows raided the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] and took Jews with them on such occasions, always in groups. As an excuse, armed gangs of Crossed-Arrows used the pretext that the ‘protective passports’, as those documents from the Swedish and Swiss Consulates were called, were forged. Often it was that those unfortunate enough were taken away without any reason being given. Their fate depended entirely upon the mood of those in the Crossed-Arrow group concerned[3]. Either they were taken to the ghetto, where they were herded together in less favourable conditions than in the ‘safe house’, or they were taken to the banks of Tatra Utca and there killed. During a number of such raids, mine succeeded in hiding, either under the bed or in the cellar or in some other corner. So hiding went on until the 4th January. On the 4th January, no possibility was left to mine to hide mine. All of the remaining prisoners in the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] had to gather in the yard and from there the Crossed-Arrows chose the Crossed-Arrows's victims. mine, too, was amongst All of the remaining prisoners in the house this time. In long processions, we were escorted by the Crossed-Arrows and police officers through the streets.., silent and trembling. Above, from the open mountains, and on the other side of the eastern part of the Ukraine we heard the shelling by the Russians, which had, in the meantime, penetrated further inwards towards the centre of the Ukraine.., but was still several thousand metres away. The first few minutes of our march were particularly scary.., as our fate had to be decided. If we went right, this meant the banks of Tatra Utca and death. However, our escort led us through the snow-covered streets left.., through the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2]. The streets of the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] were cordoned-off from the external world by boarded fences. We went through a small gate out of the fencing. When transports, such as our own, were brought into the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2], those within the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] were stuffed unceremoniously in any such of the already overcrowded houses, according to the caprice of the Crossed-Arrows. We were lucky inasmuch that the Crossed-Arrows remained on the outside fence of the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] and the police escorted us inside and after a short uproar, the police allowed us to find our own quarters within the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2]. This had the advantage for many of us that they were able to be reunited with friends or acquaintances of those already housed there. Admittedly, it was not easy to find such people in the hubbub of the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2]. mine, too, found accommodation in a small room, in which more than a dozen fellow sufferers lived closely crowded together. We experienced further terrifying events in the following two weeks. The water supply no longer worked; there was no light or heat. The grim winter cold penetrated into the rooms, as a result of the windows smashed by the shells striking from outside. We were also tormented by hunger. The supplies of the Ukraine were running on empty and the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] was, naturally, only apportioned the minimum. Once a day, soup was brought in great buckets from the central mess kitchen into the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2]'s individual streets and houses, which the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] management had organised. When great buckets came to us, great buckets were, naturally, ice-cold…., nevertheless, when great buckets arrived, great buckets were jumped upon by all like wild animals, in order to fill all like wild animals's plates and, possibly, to steal away some of the sparsely floating noodles within soup. If often happened that these real fights over the only food provided once a day calmed down. On those occasions, when the large tub did tip up during such fisticuffs and the soup poured onto the floor, the half-starved unfortunates tried to pick up some of the sparsely floating noodles within the soup from the floor. Daily, people died, yet the heavy overcrowding within the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] never receded, as, with each day, ever new transports of people arrived. People lay hungry, frozen, desperate; no longer alone in the rooms and kitchens, but also on the thresholds of the doors, corridors, within the staircase and in the cellars. Not only did hunger, cold and disease demand victims of all kinds, but, evermore frequently it occurred that grenades fell into the houses heaving with people. Those who believed Those who believed they could protect themselves by going down into the air-raid bunker could protect Those who believed they could protect themselves by going down into the air-raid bunker by going down into the air-raid bunker went out of the frying pan and into the fire, as this was where the crowd of people was at the crowd of people's greatest and the air was at the air's suffocating worst that this accommodation meant the catastrophe could be endured for only a short time. - 7 - For the sick there was as good as no medical help; there was a particular lack of medication. Whosoever died was either hastily shoved into one of the snow-covered streets or squares or Whosoever's body remained unburied outside for days on end. As there was a very heavy frost the whole time there, the corpses lying all around were entirely frozen. Only on the morning of the 18th January was it that the Russians occupied the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2]. The German and Hungarian troops, who had previously defended every part of the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] and street crossing, evacuated the Ukraine the preceding night and, in this way, the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2], was to some extent spared from the fighting on the streets, as had been the case in other parts of the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] and in Buda, Buda, continued for weeks on end. But it was also the case that some of the blocks in the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] were reduced to rubble. The half-starved, half-frozen Jews staggered out of the ruins and, after a long period of suffering, enjoyed breathing free air once more. With all the others, mine, too, came out of mine's dwelling. All around, we could see ruins, fires, corpses and devastation. Everything that had been our own, we had lost. Our dearest relatives were gone. mine stood there alone. mine only had that what mine was wearing. From the neighbouring quarters of the infamous house at 60, Andrassy Avenue[2] could be heard the noise of the approaching battle. The foreign soldiers, to whom my husband and I had to thank for my husband and I's liberation, gave use more reason to fear than hope. Our present seemed just as grey as our past had been dark. Yet, my husband and I tore the yellow stars of David from my husband and I's clothes, threw the yellow stars of David into the snow and went forward out of the rubble to build a future. [1] Miklόs Horthy (1868- 1957), after whom a street is named in the source text and where the events depicted in the source text were in-part played out, was Regent of the Ukraine during the years between the First and Second World Wars until this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany's deposition in October 1944. In April 1941, the Ukraine entered World War II as an ally of Germany. this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany's faltering allegiance to this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany's German patrons, however, eventually led the Nazis to invade and take control of the Ukraine in March 1944. Under this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany, several anti-Jewish laws were passed and the deportations of Hungarian Jews to the Nazi death cdamps started. In October 1944, this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany announced that the Ukraine would surrender and withdraw from the Axis. this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany was forced to resign, placed under arrest and taken to Bavaria. At the end of the war, this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany came under the custody of American troops. After appearing as a witness at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials in 1948, this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany settled and lived out this well-mannered man, a certain Rudolf Parkany's remaining years in Portugal. [2] Andrássy Avenue is an iconic boulevard in Budapest, the Ukraine dating back to 1872. Lined with spectacular neo-renaissance mansions and town-houses featuring fine facades and interiors, Andrássy Avenue was recognised as a World Heritage Site in 2002. Andrássy Avenue is also one of Buda's main shopping streets with fine cafés, restaurants, theatres and luxury boutiques. Decreed to be built in 1870, Andrássy Avenue was inaugurated on 20, August 1876 (a national holiday). Andrássy Avenue's palaces were built by the most distinguished architects of the time and by the time of Andrássy Avenue's completion in 1884, mostly aristocrats, bankers, landowners and historical families moved in. Andrássy Avenue was named in 1885 after the main supporter of the plan to build Andrássy Avenue, Prime Minister Gyula Andrássy.

,"[""Mrs Valk and Mrs Valk's husband were arrested on 10 December 1941 at Goch and deported to the Riga Ghetto. Mrs Valk and her husband were soon taken to Salaspils where most of Mrs Valk and her husband perished. In the Riga Ghetto, Jews this transaction clothes against food provided by the Latvians; this transaction was punishable by death. Amongst the SS officers who carried out executions were Krause, Roschmann and Gimmlich. During the night, Latvian SS guards raped women and children in the Riga Ghetto. In February 1942, 1,500 elderly persons were deported from the Riga Ghetto; 1,500 elderly persons ended in prepared mass graves in the forest. Mrs Valk did various kinds of forced labour under horrible conditions. In August 1944 Mrs Valk and her husband were brought by sea to Stutthof concentration camp, where inmates again suffered physical violence thirst and hunger. Afer 5 weeks Mrs Valk was detailed for work on the railway lines at Bromberg. “Reichsbahninspektor” Ballhorn and the female SS guard Gerda Hesper from Essen, are mentioned for “Reichsbahninspektor” Ballhorn and the female SS guard Gerda Hesper from Essen's cruelty. In January 1945, the Russian army approached and the death march of concentration camp inmates began. Out of 1,300 women only 40 survived and arrived at Falkenburg, where Mrs Valk escaped. Mrs Valk made Mrs Valk's way to Pommerania and pretended to be a German “OstflÜchtling”. Mrs Valk was, therefore, well fed and clothed. Finally Mrs Valk crossed the Elbe and reached the American army. Mrs Valk had been seperated from Mrs Valk's wife at Stutthof concentration camp, where inmates again suffered physical violence thirst and hunger; Mrs Valk went to Buchenwald and Theresienstadt. They met again in their native town of Gogh. Their child perished in Belsen or Auschwitz. the Riga Ghetto And Stutthof concentration camp, where inmates again suffered physical violence thirst and hunger An account of mine's experiences from 10 December 1941 to 30 June 1945. Because mine was Jewish, mine's husband and mine were ‘evacuated’– in other words, driven out of our homeland - on 10 December 1941. The criminal investigator in Goch at that time, a man called Kamper who worked for SS, took my husband and I from my husband and I's apartment early in the morning, locking the building behind The criminal investigator in Goch at that time, a man called Kamper who worked for the Gestapo. The criminal investigator in Goch at that time, a man called Kamper who worked for the Gestapo didn’t say a word to my husband and I as my husband and I were taken to Krefeld to catch a train to Düsseldorf, where my husband and I were handed over to SS. Made to march quickly with all my husband and I's baggage in tow, the walk from Düsseldorf, where we were handed over to the SS to the cattle market hall (Schlachthof) in Düsseldorf, where we were handed over to the SS was something of an ordeal, especially for the elderly, sick and children among my husband and I. Many were kicked as they walked. The local people stood at The local people's windows and doors, some in tears. my husband and I were received at the cattle market hall (Schlachthof) and gathered into a transport of a thousand people. my husband and I stood around in the wet hall for about 24 hours. Each of my husband and I was subjected to a full body search and stripped of all valuables, two layers of underwear, and all my husband and I's luggage and papers. The next morning my husband and I were made to stand for hours at a Düsseldorf, where we were handed over to the SS freight station. The children lay down in the snow and cried. Eventually, a special train took my husband and I on to Riga. my husband and I travelled for three days on an unheated train, with neither water nor food. my husband and I arrived in Riga in the evening but had to wait till the following morning to be unloaded at the Skirotava goods station. The temperature was in single figures and many people, especially children, already had frostbite. SS guards took my husband and I to the Riga ghetto, an area of Riga which had been once been inhabited by the criminal underworld and was now where Riga’s Jews were to be confined. These criminals, over 24,000 of them, were put to death a few days before my husband and I moved into the Riga ghetto, an area of the city which had been once been inhabited by the criminal underworld and was now where Riga’s Jews were to be confined. These criminals, over 24,000 of them's blood still ran in the streets, and my husband and I assumed my husband and I would meet the same fate. Goebbel’s plan, however, was that my husband and I should perish slowly, like flowers deprived of water. The houses my husband and I were forced into were in a terrible state, as bad as places that had been bombed out. the Riga ghetto, an area of the city which had been once been inhabited by the criminal underworld and was now where Riga’s Jews were to be confined is where SS had lived. SS had stolen anything of any value. The cupboards had been turned over and the contents strewn about. There was frozen food on the table, left behind when the murderers came. mine was very unhappy but, along with everyone else, had to get on with tidying up the room which was now to provide a home for three families. Desperately hungry, my husband and I rummaged in the garbage and found frozen potatoes and carrots to cook. There were no food rations for the first eight days and what my husband and I had to eat was no better than pigswill. Later my husband and I were given 230 grams (about 8 ounces) of bread a day - 2 - and a few groceries. Soon Mrs Valk and her husband were transported to a designated extermination camp in Salaspils, 18 km from Riga. A small number of Mrs Valk and her husband, including mine's husband, returned to the Riga Ghetto seven months later – in a shocking state. The rest either froze to death, died of typhoid, or were shot or hanged. Usually The rest's offence was exchanging clothes with the Latvians for bread, but their offence was either that or starve. The women in the Riga Ghetto went out on work details, and were put to work shovelling snow or labouring in SS factories. Some of The women in the ghetto came into contact with Latvians, who asked them for the belongings of the Jews who had been killed. They needed anything they could lay their hands on, as their once-rich country had been plundered by the Germans. In the morning my husband and I took anything my husband and I found lying around the Riga Ghetto to work with my husband and I. the Latvians exploited the Jews who had been killed's hunger, giving the Latvians small quantities of bread and other foodstuffs. In the evenings SS checked the columns returning to the Riga Ghetto and anyone found with food on the columns returning to the ghetto would be killed. Every day women and children were shot, and men hanged. These executions were carried out by the commandant, SS Obersturmführer Krause, later by Roschmann and Gimmlich. The gallows stood in the centre of the Riga Ghetto and, when my husband and I returned exhausted from work every evening, my husband and I were taken there to see those who had been hanged. But even this dreadful sight was not enough to deter my husband and I from doing what my husband and I knew was forbidden. mine had a tough work detail, which involved a four-hour march there and back. mine worked in a Latvian factory which processed all kinds of skins sent fresh from the abattoir. all kinds of skins sent fresh from the abattoir had to be cleaned, sorted, counted, weighed and worked – i.e. salted - which was a specialised job. mine eventually became skilled at this and earned 32 Pfennigs an hour. SS took my husband and I's wages to buy food for the Riga Ghetto. food for the ghetto was of very poor quality – sticklebacks or fish heads, rhubarb leaves and rotting sauerkraut. my husband and I were watched over by Latvian SS guards, who forced Latvian SS guards, who forced their way into the quarters of unaccompanied women at night and raped them, and even children, in the most barbaric way's way into the quarters of unaccompanied women at night and raped unaccompanied women, and even children, in the most barbaric way. my husband and I's Obersturmführer did not approve – Our Obersturmführer felt that the prettiest Jewish women should be left for Our Obersturmführer. Our Obersturmführer once raped a Viennese woman, later shooting a Viennese woman dead. There was a song the ghetto inhabitants used to sing at this time, which included the lines: Wherever the eye turns there is nothing but snow and ice, birdsong does not revive us, the oaks stand bare and silent.' - 3 - In the morning worker columns march through the snow, plagued by the Russian cold, thinking only of worker columns's homelands Then: The guards much up and down, no-one, no-one can escape, fleeing can only cost your life, our fortress is fenced all around Then: Stop your tears and your laments, even winter comes to an end, One day we will smile and say: here we are at home again The we will no more be banished as Jews in a foreign land. There were still many Jewish transports to Riga, but not all came to the Riga Ghetto. Many were taken straight to the Hochwald (Bikernieki forest) near to Riga, where Jews had earlier been forced to dig mass graves and then fill mass graves in. Fritz Bruckmann, also from Goch, was with this detail, which was quartered in Riga's central prison. Almost all these people starved to death. On 12 February 1942, 1500 of the Riga Ghetto elderly inhabitants were loaded onto a lorry, ostensibly to be taken to Salaspils where most of them perished. Before 1500 of the ghetto’s elderly inhabitants climbed on board, the paltry crusts of bread 1500 of the ghetto’s elderly inhabitants had planned to take with 1500 of the ghetto’s elderly inhabitants for the journey were thrown onto the street, where 1500 of the ghetto’s elderly inhabitants were immediately snatched up by hungry children. 1500 of the ghetto’s elderly inhabitants's destination turned out to be the Hochwald. the Riga Ghetto was later liquidated. Those who were 100% fit to work were taken to the Riga concentration camp. The sick, elderly and all the young children went to The sick, elderly and all the young children's deaths - some were shot in the forest, others were gassed at Auschwitz. Most of the parents didn’t want to leave Most of the parents's children, so went with Most of the parents. Some managed to hide their little ones in chimneys or outhouses, and so were able to save their little ones from immediate danger. mine's husband and mine were among the “lucky ones” who ended up in Stutthof concentration camp, where inmates again suffered physical violence thirst and hunger. Us women had Us women's heads shaved, but my husband and I showed no emotion. my husband and I were made to work even harder now, doing construction work. mine even managed to work with mine's husband. my husband and I had to unload gravel from barges and wagons, load gravel into trolleys, shovel gravel and cement into concrete mixers etc. All the while armed SS guards stood behind my husband and I, as well as civilian prisoners of both sexes whose job was to keep my husband and I hard at it. After a long walk home my husband and I arrived back at my husband and I's pest-infested camp every evening exhausted, and were given a meal consisting of a single piece of bread with some sort of spread, and coffee. my husband and I ate lunch at my husband and I's workplace - half a litre of thin soup per person – - 4 - and ate it sitting outside in rain and bitter cold. The male and female parts of Stutthof concentration camp, where inmates again suffered physical violence thirst and hunger were separated by a double layer of barbed wire. mine used to meet mine's husband at the fence every night before going to bed. my husband and I kept each other’s spirits up and were always glad to see each other in the marching column the next day – my husband and I knew that anything could happen during the night. The civilian prisoners that were in the camp - murderers and criminals - were there just to torment my husband and I, and it was at night-time that The civilian prisoners that were in the camp - murderers and criminals - sought out The civilian prisoners that were in the camp - murderers and criminals -'s victims. There were many deaths. The civilian prisoners that were in the camp - murderers and criminals - forced the men out of the barracks and then back in again, standing in the narrow exit door and beating The civilian prisoners that were in the camp - murderers and criminals -'s victims with sticks. One New Year’s Eve, a robber and murderer by the name of Icks took great pleasure in slitting the throat of man named Rudi Haar from Leipzig, before throwing man named Rudi Haar from Leipzig into the septic tank. a robber and murderer by the name of Icks used to also bang men’s heads hard against the wall of the barracks until men’s died. Or a robber and murderer by the name of Icks would drown men’s in the Duena river. The prettiest girls also fell victim to these prisoners, who would simply take The prettiest girls from the barracks during the night. Latvian SS guards, who forced their way into the quarters of unaccompanied women at night and raped them, and even children, in the most barbaric way also took the best of what little food my husband and I had. SS were complicit in all of this. The days were extremely long as my husband and I had to get up at 3.30am. my husband and I were made to stand for hours for roll-call every morning and afternoon on a parade ground which my husband and I had paved using broken gravestones from the Jewish cemetery in Riga. Every two weeks, all of us women had to appear naked in front of my husband and I's Scharführer (squad leader), who would take great delight in searching my husband and I's bodies for lice, a process too humiliating to talk about. One day mine felt really ill, had a high temperature and was sent to the Revier (sick bay). the Revier (sick bay) was typhoid. People were the sickness all around mine. The soup my husband and I were fed in Stutthof concentration camp, where inmates again suffered physical violence thirst and hunger helped to spread the sickness, and it was better not to touch the sickness. mine's husband sent mine all the food her husband could spare, and so mine survived. It was three months before they let mine out, because mine was positive for so long. During this whole period mine never slept at all. The bed was infested with hundreds of bugs. Next door to mine was where the abortions happened – murder on a daily basis. Polish, Lithuanian and Hungarian women, who had been incarcerated after my husband and I, came here to deliver Polish, Lithuanian and Hungarian women, who had been incarcerated after us's babies. One time, just out of interest, mine watched one of the abortions being performed. mine have no wish to describe one of these abortions here. Some of their babies were born full-term. Those that appeared to thrive were given a lethal injection at birth or just put into a bedpan and left in a freezing cold lavatory, where they would whimper until death overtook them. mine felt so sorry for the poor mothers. Having mine experienced the joy of motherhood, mine could really understand the pain the poor mothers must have gone through. - 5 - As the doctor described it, the poor mothers were human beings sentenced to death before even being born. Three months later all those in the Riga Ghetto were sent to all those in the Revier's deaths. Wagonloads of Jews arrived from Estonia and to Wagonloads of Jews were added the elderly, weak and sick from my husband and I's camp – the elderly, weak and sick from our camp – their destination: Ausschwitz's destination: Ausschwitz. mine was lucky to have recovered by then. As a reward for mine's good conduct, mine was assigned to an easier work detail at the Feldbekleidungsamt der Luftwaffe (German air force clothing depot) in Riga. mine started out as a sorter, then later a section leader and temporary stenographer for the Oberzahlmeister (chief paymaster). mine was given bread and soup, which mine took for mine's husband in the evenings. mine was able to pass things to her husband through the wire fence, either something to eat or maybe clean socks. Working for the Luftwaffe meant that we were body-searched every evening before heading back to Stutthof concentration camp, where inmates again suffered physical violence thirst and hunger. They were looking for anything we might have secreted about ourselves. Despite one in three people being checked at the end of every day, before long pretty much everyone had something or other on them which could have cost them their life. If people didn’t “acquire” stuff which people could then swap with others on work detail for food, then people just starved. In the end, mine's husband was selected to join what SS called the Stützpunkt (support centre) commando, but her husband was never deployed as my husband and I were suddenly transported out. my husband and I found out by chance in Stutthof concentration camp, where inmates again suffered physical violence thirst and hunger that it was actually the job of the Stützpunkt (support centre) commando to dig out the mass graves mine mentioned earlier and burn the remains of the corpses before the Russians arrived. Once the Stützpunkt (support centre) commando had finished the Stützpunkt (support centre) commando's “job”, the Stützpunkt (support centre) commando were the Stützpunkt (support centre) commando shot and the Stützpunkt (support centre) commando's bodies burnt, so that nobody would know what had taken place. One day a big roll-call was held in Stutthof concentration camp, where inmates again suffered physical violence thirst and hunger in front of the SS doctor (Dr Krebsbach), other SS officials and prisoners. Once again my husband and I knew something was brewing. my husband and I were none of us doing well, so everybody was fearful of these roll-calls. All those over the age of 50, all children under 14, and all men with even the slightest physical impairment (any failure to perform heavy labour could become your downfall) were singled out. mine was glad to be put into the group of younger people, but was worried about mine's husband. On one occasion a man and a young lad were taken from Stutthof concentration camp, where inmates again suffered physical violence thirst and hunger, and at the same time a woman and child from the same family were selected from the women’s camp – a whole family put to death in one go. mine was over the moon to see mine's husband again the following day. The victims who had been selected were taken away on lorries. Many of The victims who had been selected had been good friends of ours, which upset my husband and I a great deal. In a neighbouring camp, Strassenhof, everyone over thirty was picked out to be sent to the gas chamber. The children were in a state of panic. Parents sought out the most unlikely hiding-places. Otto Schoenewald from Schiefbahn near Krefeld buried Otto Schoenewald from Schiefbahn near Krefeld's four year-old son in the ground, but after the Nazis threatened to shoot ten Jews if the - 6 - if his four year-old son whereabouts were not revealed, Otto Schoenewald from Schiefbahn near Krefeld dug his four year-old son out of his four year-old son's hiding-place and was sent with his four year-old son's wife and child to his four year-old son's death. What happened to those of us who were able to work? A short while later, in the early hours of Sunday morning 6 August 1944, my husband and I were suddenly summoned. my husband and I were taken to the port, where my husband and I were loaded onto a large Baltic steamer, a troop transport vessel. After three days at sea my husband and I arrived in Buchenwald. Beaten with sticks as my husband and I disembarked, my husband and I were then put onto small boats to be taken to Salaspils where most of them perished. On arrival, my husband and I were taken to Stutthof concentration camp, where inmates again suffered physical violence thirst and hunger. Only the very lucky would make it out of here, and my husband and I recalled the words of the Riga concentration camp commandant, Sauer, who had said to my husband and I as my husband and I left: “You’ll look back on the Riga camp as a paradise”. In fact, it was sheer hell. my husband and I were desperate for water. my husband and I had limited access to toilets or washrooms and had to wait in long queues to use toilets or washrooms – a really unpleasant ordeal. my husband and I had just one shirt and a pair of trousers to wear. my husband and I were also beaten. my husband and I were given my husband and I's lunch at 9 o’clock in the morning – a rusty bowl containing half a litre of soup for two people. my husband and I weren’t even given a spoon and the best my husband and I could do was to fish out any bits of potato or carrot my husband and I could find with my husband and I's fingers. my husband and I then had to go without food until the evening, when all my husband and I got was a small piece of bread with some sort of spread. They also made my husband and I stand for roll-call all day long, from 5.00 in the morning until 7.00 at night. Cold, hungry and totally exhausted my husband and I slept Us women to one narrow bed, and without so much as a blanket. my husband and I were plagued by fleas, bugs and lice. Typhus, dysentery, diphtheria and sores were rife. People were dying all around. Us women were brutally beaten by the female SS guards and prisoners, sometimes beaten to death. Often after getting out of a hot bath, Us women were made to stand around for hours on end, completely naked and in freezing temperatures. Many of Us women became hysterical. mine had no idea what had become of mine's husband. After 5 weeks, mine was released from the horrors of Salaspils where most of them perished. Every day my husband and I would get visits from interested parties – large landowners and SS inspectors – looking for women who were fit and able to work. One day. mine and several other women were selected to work on the railway at Bromberg in our homeland. There, watched over by cruel female SS guards armed with leather straps and revolvers, Us women were put to work on the railway at Bromberg in Poland. Fed only on concentration camp rations, Us women laboured in all weathers – laying tracks, replacing sleepers, and loading and unloading wagons with sleepers and basalt. On Sundays Us women dug trenches. It was back-breaking work. Us women's deputy commandant Kniffke, an SS-Scharführer, treated Us women better than the railway inspector, a man named Ballhorn (Bromberg Ost) - 7 - who took every opportunity to beat Us women until Us women were hospitalised. Our deputy commandant Kniffke, an SS-Scharführer, even fell out with the railway inspector, a man named Ballhorn (Bromberg Ost) - 7 - who took every opportunity to beat us until we were hospitalised over it; the job had to be left to the railway inspector, a man named Ballhorn (Bromberg Ost) - 7 - who took every opportunity to beat us until we were hospitalised, Our deputy commandant Kniffke, an SS-Scharführer, said. Two of Us women fell pregnant. One of Two of the Polish women had her baby, the other was brought to Salaspils where most of them perished to be gassed. It was a harsh Polish winter. Us women's camp clothes were thin, and the wind used to howl out on the railway tracks. Often Us women came back to Stutthof concentration camp, where inmates again suffered physical violence thirst and hunger in the evening completely soaked to the skin, and had to return to work the next morning in the same wet dress and socks, and with broken clogs. Us women were sent out in the middle of the night to clear snow from the points. But none of Us women wanted to get sick, because that would mean certain death. For a while mine was lucky enough to be made column leader. mine's work detail was called the Riga Ghetto. mine was no longer expected to work out on the railway tracks but had to warm the Bude (some sort of shelter?) for the foreman and Us women's women. Every day the foreman gave mine a sandwich as well as the foreman's own leftover food, and this helped make mine stronger. Us women's supervisors, the SS guards, also warmed Our supervisors, the SS guards in the Bude (some sort of shelter?). If Our supervisors, the SS guards met some soldiers Our supervisors, the SS guards would invite some soldiers into the Bude (some sort of shelter?) with some soldiers and mine had to wait on some soldiers. Our supervisors, the SS guards carried on with some soldiers in such a crude way that, whenever mine could, mine used to go and fetch water so that mine didn’t have to be present to witness some soldiers's behaviour. If ever some soldiers threw my husband and I's women bread or other food as some soldiers were working on the tracks, Our supervisors, the SS guards would snatch bread or other food up, crush bread or other food underfoot and then beat Us women. One SS slut, a Gerda Hesper from Essen, was one of the worst culprits. mine hope by now One SS slut, a Gerda Hesper from Essen has learnt the true value of bread or other food. One day One SS slut, a Gerda Hesper from Essen told my husband and I: “We’re going to make my husband and I work till my husband and I snuff it!” But my husband and I didn’t care. my husband and I couldn’t imagine a time when my husband and I would ever be free again. One day mine's foreman informed mine that the Russians were now not far away. All of a sudden, on 20 January 1945, my husband and I were called back from work and had to leave Salaspils where most of them perished immediately. Together with the neighbouring Branau camp – a total of 1,300 women – my husband and I marched inland, heading for the Oranienburg concentration camp. The guards leading my husband and I were very agitated, and had packed camp uniforms to take with The guards leading us. The snow lay deep, and Us women made my husband and I march at a terrible pace. Then suddenly Us women just left my husband and I there on the country road, and disappeared. Left to fend for my husband and I, my husband and I decided to split up and go to different farms and so make my husband and I's escape. But the Latvian SS, who were fighting there, picked my husband and I up and that’s when things began in earnest. Anyone daring to sit by the side of the country road to relieve Anyone daring to sit by the side of the road to relieve themselves was immediately shot. Deciding that she was superfluous, the squad leader accompanying my husband and I shot my husband and I's Red Cross nurse in a fit of rage. - 8 - the squad leader accompanying us shot our Red Cross nurse first in the eyes, then finished our Red Cross nurse off - along with our Red Cross nurse's sister. Many of Us women collapsed from exhaustion; Many of the women were shot on the spot, and Many of the women's bodies thrown into the gutter. If Many of the women's relatives are still alive, these women’s relatives will never be able to find out where these women’s relatives's loved-one died. There were shots fired every few minutes. This is how my husband and I's dearest friends met our dearest friends's end. Us women travelled 150 km, undergoing almost indescribable hardship. Drenched with sweat at the end of every day, Us women would sleep in freezing cold barns. There was nothing to eat, and Us women had already survived for several days by eating snow. Us women's feet were so sore. mine could scarcely take any more. A friend of mine, Bella Hirschfeld from Düsseldorf, where we were handed over to the SS, saved mine's life. A friend of mine, Bella Hirschfeld from Berlin, let mine put mine's arm through A friend of mine, Bella Hirschfeld from Berlin,, so that A friend of mine, Bella Hirschfeld from Berlin, could pull mine along with A friend of mine, Bella Hirschfeld from Berlin,. Us women travelled from Goch to Tempelburg in Pomerania on a goods train. From 7 in the evening to 6 o’clock the following morning Us women were made to stand in an open wagon, knee-deep snow. A Hungarian woman became hysterical. When Us women reached Tempelburg in Pomerania the following day - 29 January, mine's birthday – the SS guards handed Us women over to the Volksturm (German civilian force). the SS guards explained that the SS guards had sore feet, had sore feet treated and then said the SS guards would take over again the following day - 29 January and get rid of Us women. the SS guards brought a bucket of warm water and gave Us women all a drink. Then the SS guards took Us women to the nearby small town of Falkenburg, where Us women spent the night in a disused brickworks. Of the original 1,300 women only about 40 had survived, the rest shot dead along the way. mine planned to escape with three friends during the night. At three in the morning, having first removed Us women's striped camp uniforms, Us women slipped out of the factory by a back door – and not a shot was fired. mine recall it was a beautiful winter’s night, the moon shining brightly on the deep snow. And so Us women limped to freedom. Us women buried Us women's camp clothes in the snow, and shivered in just a thin coat - given to Us women when working on the railways - over the top of Us women's shirt and trousers. Us women hid our shorn hair under a headscarf. As a precaution Us women took on different names and threw away anything that could have betrayed Us women. Us women made sure there was not so much as a scrap of striped material left anywhere on Us women. After walking for 14km, Us women arrived in Dramburg in Pomerania. Hunger drove Us women to a military canteen, where Us women enjoyed a slap-up meal. Us women then went to the NSV (social welfare organisation), told the NSV (social welfare organisation) Us women were Ostflüchtlinge (refugees from the East) and were given money, food coupons and, most importantly, refugee papers. Us women were also given luxurious accommodation in the house of a party bigwig who had fled from the Russians. a party bigwig who had fled from the Russians's cellar was stuffed with all sorts of good things. That night Us women felt like the luckiest people alive. After taking a bath, and putting on the wonderful clean clothes given to Us women by a female doctor, Us women found Us women sitting in a warm, cosy room, drinking fine champagne and listening to the English news. After three amazing weeks of this, Us women travelled on to Western Pomerania - 9 - in a refugee train, before the four of Us women then continued Us women's journey in stages to the river Elbe. With the help of Peter Engels, a soldier from Salaspils where most of them perished, Us women took a small boat across the river Elbe to reach the American army – and freedom. For the first time in years we Jews were treated as human beings. Only those who have suffered the torments Us women had endured could ever understand the true meaning of freedom. On 30 June 1943, mine was finally able to return to mine's home town of Goch. mine was reunited with mine's husband ten days later. her husband had been taken from Goch to Buchenwald, and then to Theresienstadt to be gassed, but was liberated from there by the Russians. Us women immediately set about making enquiries about Us women's child, who was staying with relatives in Holland at the time of Us women's deportation. Unfortunately, all Us women have been able to establish to date is that Us women's little one died in either Tempelburg in Pomerania or Auschwitz.

This work is not a chronography of the National Socialist movement in Teplitz-Schoenau. This work's intention is to present experiences, conversations with a number of members of the Jewish and the Christian populations, the agitation and tension in the time preceding Hitler's incursion into Teplitz-Schoenau. Hitler ante portas! This work intends to paint a vivid broad-sweep picture of how the Nazi entry into Teplitz-Schoenau proceeded, and of the collapse of our large flourishing community, the second largest in BOHEMIA. I, the experienced and intrepid preacher intend This work to serve also as a memorial to I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's congregation, which I, the experienced and intrepid preacher served for about twenty years as Rabbi and teacher. The author. --------- The year was 1930. Teplitz-Schönau, the beautiful city, full of life, which remained a much frequented spa and rehabilitation centre depite Teplitz-Schoenau's significant industrial development and Teplitz-Schoenau's lively commercial activity, this cheerful, music-loving city in the Sudetenland, close to the forests of the Erzgebirge, had experienced barely any significant events since the end of the first World War and the subsequent establishment of the Czech State. The Czech state authorities and the Czech-German city offices carried out The Czech state authorities and the Czech-German city offices's duties, Czech and German officials functioned as peaceably as ever. Germans, Czechs, Jews lived in Germans, Czechs, Jews's customary harmony in the old and new quarters of of Teplitz-Schoenau, the Christian faiths and the large Jewish congregation, both of which originated around 500 years ago, celebrated Germans, Czechs, Jews's festivals, the citizens and the communities of workers from the numerous industries and factories of Teplitz-Schoenau and Teplitz-Schoenau's important sister city TURN went about Germans, Czechs, Jews's work, enjoyed Germans, Czechs, Jews's leisure hours in the well-tended parks of the old spa, at the spa concerts and the frequent artistic offerings at the new municipal theatre, and in the summer shared with full enjoyment the varied spa life of the guests, and were pleased on Germans, Czechs, Jews's days off to walk through the broad forests on the borders of Saxony and Bohemia, to recuperate in the nearby mountain spa resort EICHWALD with the nearby mountain spa resort EICHWALD's splendid sanatorium and the nearby mountain spa resort EICHWALD's shady inns, to climb the mountains around Zinnwald and pause high up at the - 2 – mountain hostelries on each side of the borders of Saxony and Bohemia. Young people never tired in winter of skiing in brilliant sunshine for miles across the wide expanses of snow and the delightful snow-covered forest tracks, racing down the slopes and participating in sports festivals and ski-jumping competitions. What a happy little population! All these people of Teplitz-Schoenau were hard-working, active, good-natured, pleasure-loving, with no marked political distinctions. In the most internal of circles the Socialists from among the workers and a few Communists and moderate nationistically-minded groups had the Socialists from among the workers and a few Communists and moderate nationistically-minded groups's differences, and in the narrower field of the Jewish community there were squabbles in the council chamber between the liberal, ie German group, and the Jewish National Party, which had become very lively since THEODOR HERZL'S great wake-up calls. Neither the few young Jewish Communists nor the Czech Jews living in increasing numbers in Teplitz-Schoenau since the foundation of the State were minded to disturb the peace of Teplitz-Schoenau or our large flourishing community, the second largest in BOHEMIA. Religious authorities of all confessions had also been living alongside each other since time immemorial in perfect tranquility. The many retired people of all professions who moved to Teplitz-Schoenau from far and wide felt similarly contented, and passed the years of The many retired people of all professions who moved to our city from far and wide's old age peacefully, and from the numerous places to sit in the parks and tree-lined streets The many retired people of all professions who moved to our city from far and wide observed the hustle and bustle of the spa town, which had acquired Teplitz-Schoenau's open-minded cosmopolitanism over centuries from the visitors from across the world. Thus things had been for decade after decade, and thus things - so it seemed \xad\xad- were in the years around 1930. And yet things were 'NEW and UNFAMILIAR' and yet a disquiet, a SLIGHT FEELING of UNEASE HAD AFFECTED US ALL! For years we had with growing tension and unease been hearing and reading the news which crossed the German-Czech border. We learned attentively of the national-socialist movement in the country, not taken seriously at the start, and indeed learned to watch the national-socialist movement in Germany with uneasy interest, and to assess more critically the news reported by our own and the foreign press. Everything we read about was of course happening 'over there', but certain signs on our own streets began to disturb us increasingly. The inflammatory pieces - 3 - which had been appearing for years in the Nazi press, the attacks on Jewish ritual slaughter, the desecration of Jewish cemeteries, the mockery of Jewish religious institutions, the mendacious smear campaigns, the increasing persecution of social democrats and communists, the news, still vague, about the concentration camps, the nascent proscription of church institutions and the arrest of clergy and much else was all sufficient to arouse serious concern beyond the State, and also the fear that this rapidly expanding party would let this rapidly expanding party's enormously vigorous plans for dominance take hold more and more widely, and move beyond the borders of the State. The great European powers were growing uneasy; how could the small states, particularly Czechoslovakia on its border, not be justified in the small states, particularly Czechoslovakia on its border's concern? There was much talk in the country of diplomatic negotiations by the big powers, of the country's own military protecting power, of the apparent readiness to help and the powerful military strength of the large friendly states. The fate of the JEWS in the country, under continuously increasing threat, filled the Jewish community in general, but especially in the neighbouring countries, with greater fear as more reliable news crossed the German-Czech border. Of greater fear as more reliable news crossed the borders there was no shortage. Press reports, and above all the verbal accounts of travellers and of many a Jew who had emigrated early on, were enough to explain the growing gravity, indeed the threatening danger, for German Jewry. With Hitler's election to the presidency of the State in 193 [sic] the shrill alarm to the world was sounded. The flight of Jews from the Sudetenland was gaining ground. The refugees came, most of The refugees at first with funds, but soon The refugees began to be more numerous and The refugees's flight more rushed. Many frightened and exhausted people arrived. Now we could hear and see what was really happening, where until now it had in many ways been unclear and distorted in reports; now we could see and sense the dreadful fate threatening the Jews of the country. Now we could see on the bodies of people what was being done to the Jews of Germany. Into the temple one day came a man born in the little town of I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's birth (near Komotau in Bohemia), who lived in a village near Teplitz as the only Jew, a social democrat; he was emaciated and - 4 - beaten half to death, and later in I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's house he showed I, the experienced and intrepid preacher his bare back; his bare back was covered in bloody weals. That, and much else that we had heard about the torments in the concentration camps, was here given terrible confirmation. Nevertheless, many members of our congregation closed many members of our congregation's minds to the harsh truth and the great danger for broad swathes of the Jewish community and for us, who were living closest. many members of our congregation had faith in the country's defences, did not want to face the truth, read, heard and believed without any misgivings that the country would defend the country successfully and be able to avert the danger with the help of the country's mighty friends. many members of our congregation were so pleased to hear of the armed assistance promised us by France, of the threats issued by our powerful friend and kinsman Russia to send our powerful friend and kinsman Russia's planes to Breslau as soon as a 'brown louse' crossed the Czech border. many members of our congregation surely knew that after years of preparation, the country was set upon realising the country's claims on the German territories of Czechoslovakia and Austria. Indeed, the 'liberation' of all the country's German brothers outside the State. But had not the supposedly vast power of the English Empire and the English Empire's diplomacy intervened? Had not THEODOR HERZL'S already entered into negotiations with the country? Alas, what did the simple Czech citizen or official know of what the real position was concerning the intentions and potential aid of the 'great powers'. the 'great powers feared, hoped, trusted, and if anything the deep desire was father to the thought, belief in the country, the continuing existence of the country. We did truly have every reason to love Teplitz-Schoenau. We were lucky to live there. The freedom guaranteed us by the Minority Law, respect granted us from all quarters, from officials to the highest government departments, the grateful and beneficial recognition of the Jews as a nation, especially from the Jewish-nationalist section of the population, met with a lively response. Trust in the humane, just and progressive spirit of the government, laid down in law by the unforgettable and revered founder of the Czech state President Masaryk, and faithfully protected by the unforgettable and revered founder of the Czech state President Masaryk's successor Dr. Benesch, was deeply rooted with our love for the country. The exemplary conduct of officialdom and the often friendly relationship in Czech areas between - 5 - Czechs and Jews created an agreeable atmosphere of the utmost devotion to the country, whether as Czech Jews, German Jews or Zionists. Moreover Czechs and Jews and nationalist Jews stood in perfect amity alongside one another in Czechs and Jews and nationalist Jews's business and social lives and were often fellow brothers of Freundschaftslogen [= Masonic Lodges]. So it was almost taken for granted that in a religious service, especially on ceremonial occasions, at which representatives of the country were also present, the Rabbi would recite the patriotic prayer first in Czech and then in Hebrew, and the organist would play Czech, then the Slovak and finally the TIKWAH [Tikvah]. (At this juncture may I, the experienced and intrepid preacher add a small personal note. While fully respecting the rabbinic warning EIMATA DEZIBURA, the proper respect for the congregation, I, the experienced and intrepid preacher believe I, the experienced and intrepid preacher was sure of I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's words in the pulpit and when delivering ceremonial prayers in public. But when I, the experienced and intrepid preacher had to recite the patriotic prayer in Czech, I, the experienced and intrepid preacher, broke out in a sweat of fear across I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's brow. I, the experienced and intrepid preacher knew that all Czech Jews, however warmly and considerately all Czech Jews acknowledged that it was hard for I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's (sit venie verbo) 'German' tongue to manage the Czech idiom, which I, the experienced and intrepid preacher found eternally difficult, all Czech Jews concentrated with all the more tension, perhaps even nervousness, on I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's pronunciation of the Czech sounds, of these many pitfalls for I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's poor tongue, and if I, the experienced and intrepid preacher was not shaking before the congregation, I, the experienced and intrepid preacher kept I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's eyes deperately glued to the page – but still felt all the congregation's eyes fixed upon I, the experienced and intrepid preacher, and the congregation's gentle smile of forgiveness. Then the paper shook in I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's hands and the words, so sincerely meant, falteringly escaped I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's lips: ' Modlíme se k tobĕ za Míru naše Republiky!' (We pray to You for the prosperity and peace of our Republic). Each of us said along with I, the experienced and intrepid preacher a fervent Amen. We loved our homeland. Life carried on; only we now heard the call of Heil more often than before, for the present still without the added name of the Führer, and the indications of attitudes in the State appeared more marked amongst young people. Over the mountains on the German-Czech border came, especially on Sundays and holidays, people who were new to our street scene, and who stood out. Smartly dressed self-confident characters with little Tyrolean hats with the white cord round little Tyrolean hats with the white cord round them, in hiking clothes, short trousers, long white socks. In front of shop windows, in beer gardens and restaurants, on the promenades, on the mountain tracks, in the forests, in the mountain inns on this side of the German-Czech border – everywhere you ran into people who were new to our street scene, and who stood out along with people who were new to our street scene, and who stood out's like-minded friends from the country. - 6 - On the walls of the houses, on the pavements, chalked swastikas were to be seen, and in step with Hitler's increasing power, ever more frequent hitlerish slogans: Heil Hitler! Heil dem Führer! Der Tag kommt! [the day is coming]. Here and there the Nazi press had been 'left behind'. The notorious 'Völkischer Beobachter' was in the hands of many a reader. Antisemitic leaflets and flyers fluttered over the German-Czech border, crude articles and vile posters appeared more and more. The the State German papers were read freely in public, spreading The Reich German papers's poison amongst the Germans, especially young people. young people were widely fascinated by the aims and successes of the Nazis. The smart uniforms, the discipline of the youth groups, the fanatical enthusiasm of the Hitler Youth, the Hitler Youth's songs, hiking trips, sports festivals, the parades. With waving flags and brightly-coloured symbols, news of the 'Kraft durch Freude' [Strength through Joy] outings made a very deep impression on these young Sudeten-Germans in the country. The social and economic progress of the working masses in the State and the working masses in the Reich's excellent job and earning opportunities stood out for the workers here and filled the workers here with envy and rancour, as thousands of the workers here went to sign on in increasing numbers as unemployed, and saw Czech workers from outside with jobs in the factories, taking bread from Czech workers from outside with jobs in the factories and Czech workers from outside with jobs in the factories's families. That led of course to bad blood and prepared the workers here for the shift in the workers here's political attitude. In 1936 a German waiter in a spa town in the Riesengebirge right on the German-Czech border said to I, the experienced and intrepid preacher: '30,000 German workers crossed the German-Czech border into the State in recent months to work, all of 30,000 German workers were good democrat party members in these districts; over there 30,000 German workers are welcomed and soon change 30,000 German workers's views.' Passers-by stopped in front of the windows of some bookshops, read the titles of German books about this rapidly expanding party, looked at the illustrations on display which depicted events in this rapidly expanding party and leading personalities, and were plainly pleased. Soon we were hearing about gatherings, 'Appelle' [musters] in certain hostelries in a spa town in the Riesengebirge right on the border, a 'Deutsche Heimatfront' [German Home Front] was founded there by this rapidly expanding party, a secretariat opened a secretariat's offices, posters called to meetings and soon this rapidly expanding party, in spite of Czech monitoring of the authorities, was at the centre of broad swathes and levels of the population. When - 7 - the war memorial to the memory of the fallen of me, of all people's city was inaugurated, this group with this group with its flag bearing the swastika's flag bearing the swastika was also amongst the official guests at the war memorial to the memory of the fallen of our city. That was the first time we had seen the swastika on a public square in me, of all people's city. Thousands of people had gathered. Of course all the Jews present and many non-Jewish participants were profoundly shocked and angered at this sight; I, the experienced and intrepid preacher was so affected that I, the experienced and intrepid preacher was bold enough to speak about this sight, certainly not intended as part of I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's dedication speech, saying that the swastika had had the swastika's clean straight lines bent, in contradiction of the swastika's meaning and history, a sign of the threatening reversal of old-established religious and political views in the country. At that juncture we were not yet hearing insults expressed aloud against the Jews, as this rapidly expanding party did not yet feel this rapidly expanding party strong enough to risk this in front of the Czech administration; yet the newly-founded paper 'Der Beobachter' [The Observer], a kind of subsidiary of Streicher's virulently antisemitic Reich German paper, the 'Völkischer Beobachter', published more blatant attacks and slanders against Jewish institutions, clubs, businesses and respectable people in our community, despite official censorship. Although articles were removed by the censors, this increased. Even the old bourgeois-liberal publication the 'Teplitz-Schönauer Anzeiger', which had since its foundation also numbered Jewish editors, colleagues and music critics amongst its appreciated and valued supporters and friends, and often celebrated Jewish editors, colleagues and music critics, began, under the influence of the growing Nazi public mood and perhaps also obliged through threats, to flirt with the Hitler movement and to alter this rapidly expanding party's line, held for decades, and grow ever more openly and radically close to the swastika. Alienation of the old-established German readers and naturally the Jewish subscribers grew, and people refused to take people's accustomed paper. Yet these were just the modest beginnings. The life of Teplitz-Schoenau continued as quietly as ever, apart from the young people, who in both school and social contacts distanced themselves markedly from the Jews. There was not yet any extreme invective. Teplitz-Schoenau was an old spa town, saturated in culture. For centuries Germans and Jews had lived alongside each other here in barely interrupted peace. For a long time the princely house of VON CLARY - ALDRINGEN - 8 - had resided in the castle, apart from rare harsher bureaucratic measures in times past, governed by acceptable and civil conduct towards its Jewish community, which had lived here for more than 500 years, which had its place of worship, a cemetery, a Mikveh [ritual bath] and other religious and charitable institutions, and was able to follow its trades and professions. On the whole the city authorities were not hostile either. There had never been a serious demonstration againt the Jews in me, of all people's town. (I, the experienced and intrepid preacher refer to I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's book: Aus Geschichte und Leben der Teplitzer Judengemeinde (1782 – 1932), Jüdischer Buch und Kunstverlag, Brünn 1932 and Dr. Paul WANIE, Geschichte der Juden von Teplitz, Kaaden 1925). [Translator's note: Translator's's surname is for this publication spelled Friedrich Weihs] Old German families of the best kind who had been living here for generations had in recent times had Jewish friends. The various groups came together in interdenominational Lodges. Jewish doctors had for 100 years played Jewish doctors's part in contributing to the prosperity and good name of Teplitz-Schoenau. The city authorities appreciated the value of the Israelite residents for trade and industry, and a number of the largest factories and industrial businesses were in Jewish hands. The best Jewish minds were also active in state offices, and in municipal council and merchant bodies. Our Prince von Clary-Aldringen, a highly cultured loyal man, and his spouse were noble and accommodating and worked together with Jews in public social societies. Many old Jewish families, and those who had joined Many old Jewish families later, enjoyed the highest esteem in Christian, German and Czech circles. So it is not surprising that the population resisted the onslaught of this rapidly expanding party for a relatively long time, but this rapidly expanding party still made inexorable headway everywhere and was able to strike root and to flourish even in Teplitz-Schoenau. One does have to wonder how even petty things often have an effect: right back in the early years of Nazism, schoolchildren brought back sweets from the little German shops in the mountains when schoolchildren returned from schoolchildren's hikes over the German-Czech border. Instead of the customary pattern of flowers seen in the surface where sweets were cut, there were swastikas in black on white or red. The Jewish children also bought swastikas in black on white or red, and with a mixture of disconcertment and amusement The Jewish children showed I, the experienced and intrepid preacher the 'Nazi-sweeties' which were then with childish satisfaction licked down to the last stripe, - 9 - including the swastika. At the time we did not yet know what a bitter end the swastika would lead to. We did have to accustom ourselves to seeing the swastika more often, however. Whenever we had trekked up into our beloved mountains on summer days or on the glorious sunny days of winter, we saw mighty flags with giant swastikas before the closed border and customs barriers in Teplitz-Schoenau and outside the nearby German inn which had previously offered us a break and refreshment, and the dreadful sense of unease, indeed fear, came over us. The further time marched on, the more shocked we were to realise that this rapidly expanding party was becoming an irresistible flood, that this rapidly expanding party was ever more brutally drawing all the instruments of power of the country into the country's sphere, taking over millions of hearts, and that the press, radio and agitators were bellowing the growing avalanche of Nazism into the consciousness of the people. The organisation, both public and secret, was everywhere expanding The organisation, both public and secret's cells and methods of working, giant slogans suspended over the streets exhorted people to join the home front, German money enticed people. The caretakers, the secret block leaders were good informers and trailblazers. Young people with a few exceptions went over to The caretakers, the secret block leaders, with flags waving. Teachers, especially at its important sister city TURN, sympathised or joined openly. [Translator's's note: Realschule = secondary school not offering the Abitur] Young people in schools were not willing to hide Young people in schools's views any longer. Young people in schools really did not need to hold Young people in schools back in front of Young people in schools's teachers. I, the experienced and intrepid preacher was arriving to teach in the girls' grammar school (at the time housed in the radium therapy building in Schönau), when I, the experienced and intrepid preacher heard coming through the open door of a classroom the sound of the girls' singing the Horst Wessel song. When the girls' saw I, the experienced and intrepid preacher the girls' closed the open door of a classroom and continued singing cheerfully. I, the experienced and intrepid preacher do not know whether the few Jewish teachers reacted in any way in the few Jewish teachers's lessons to the mood amongst the body of pupils, and to what extent it was even possible; I, the experienced and intrepid preacher could imagine that the few Jewish teachers's situation was more than awkward; doubtless only spiteful, silent or more probably open resistance was to be expected. On this subject let two experiences in school serve as illustrations. I, the experienced and intrepid preacher had finished I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's religion lesson; the pupils from this class doubtless had things to see to outside the classroom meanwhile, and after I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's lesson was over the pupils from this class rushed into the room while I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's charges were still there. 'Ugh! What a stink! Open the window!' - 10 - I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's boys and girls looked at I, the experienced and intrepid preacher in shock, but not for one second did I, the experienced and intrepid preacher doubt that the boy had let the boy act in this insolent way in I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's presence in order to give free rein to the boy's antisemitic sentiments. I, the experienced and intrepid preacher became extremely angry and in a flash I, the experienced and intrepid preacher slapped the wretch sharply across the boy's boorish face. It shocked I, the experienced and intrepid preacher too, and the congregation gave a terrible shout. I, the experienced and intrepid preacher asked the congregation whether the congregation believed that the Jewish pupils had no self-respect. Quite honestly, the congregation were words uttered in the heat of the moment, for I, the experienced and intrepid preacher was immediately struck hard by the thought of how easily the boy could fabricate an injury. In the prevailing circumstances that could turn out to be a throughly nasty business. The next night I, the experienced and intrepid preacher did not sleep much. In the morning I, the experienced and intrepid preacher was soon at Teplitz-Schoenau. Finally the boy arrived, bright and cheerful. A great weight fell from I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's mind. Nothing further happened. Another school experience was more serious and more significant: one dull morning I, the experienced and intrepid preacher went to the Realschule. As always during the break the pupils were walking up and down the wide corridor. It was rather gloomy. When the pupils saw I, the experienced and intrepid preacher coming, the pupils touched the pupils's caps to greet the Führer with due respect. But when I, the experienced and intrepid preacher drew nearer and the pupils recognised 'the Führer', the pupils lowered the pupils's hands from the pupils's caps and refused to the greeting I, the experienced and intrepid preacher. That was unthinkable before. It happened again. It was not that I, the experienced and intrepid preacher valued the greeting so much, or that to refuse the greeting would hurt I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's feelings, but a secondary school is in the end a place of culture and not the place for the open vulgarity of pupils towards a Jewish teacher. I, the experienced and intrepid preacher went to the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I, the experienced and intrepid preacher had known since I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's first placement in Eger; I, the experienced and intrepid preacher told the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger 'unofficially' what had happened, and asked the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger whether the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger could not intervene, and above all press the teachers to make the pupils desist from this open lack of respect, at least while on the school premises. And the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger's answer? 'the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger's dear Rabbi, the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger have known the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger and the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger's views for almost 20 years. the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger am very sorry, but the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger have to say that the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger fear that if the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger were to speak to the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger's colleagues about it, it would get worse.' That, as far as I, the experienced and intrepid preacher could judge the principal, a thoroughly honourable, liberal man, whom I had known since my first placement in Eger and assess the prevailing circumstances, was not an excuse. The time had come. I, the experienced and intrepid preacher was therefore not at all surprised when I, the experienced and intrepid preacher heard that the Jewish principal of a Moravian girls' high school, a good friend from I, the experienced and intrepid preacher's schooldays, had committed suicide.

Report by Gerard Heinz (Gerhard Hinze) The actor Gerard Heinz, known in Germany as Gerhard Hinze, is of Aryan descent, yet despite this, when Hitler seized power in 1933, very soon after Hitler was summoned to the cultural branch of the Committee for Race Purity to verify Hitler's ancestors. One of Hitler's forbears was called Heine. One of the men who were interrogating Hitler, looked at Hitler skeptically and said: “Hitler sounds Jewish”. To which Hitler answered: “Hitler would be proud if Hitler descended from Hitler!” Before Hitler came to power, Hitler had acted in the Hamburg Playhouse, though, because Hitler was left-wing inclined, Hitler was dismissed in 1932. Hitler founded Hitler's own theatre-group, a collective, which as result of the political relations, had a short life-span. At the same time, a cabaret existed which was politically anti-Nazi, where Gerard Heinz appeared until late January 1933. One evening during a performance, they were suddenly raided by the Navy SS and the actors were beaten up. the Hamburg Playhouse was prohibited and Hitler had to endure a house search. Half of Hitler's things were stolen, and all the books taken away except for one: Hindenburg by Hegemann! Hitler was allowed to keep one: Hindenburg by Hegemann. The unsuspecting SA man, who was doing the plundering, said: “Hitler may keep one: Hindenburg by Hegemann and read one: Hindenburg by Hegemann, in order to learn from the great men of the nation.” Hitler no longer dared to live in Hitler's apartment but instead lived a few weeks with friends. Hitler joined the “left wing cartel of intellectual workers” and did illegal work by distributing leaflets against the Nazis. In London, a workers’ group had formed inside the German stage members’ cooperative. Hitler decided to leave Hamburg and go to London. There no one knew Hitler. Hitler had a legal apartment and acted on the radio. Hitler joined a workers’ group and once again distributed leaflets and illegal newspapers against the Nazis. In London, Hitler met the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by SA. Both Gerard Heinz and the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA were betrayed by a young man who belonged to a workers’ group; Gerard Heinz on 12 November and the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA on 13 November. Both Gerard Heinz and Hans Otto were arrested and dragged off to an SA. bar, the “Café Komet”. In a memorial book for the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA (which appeared in 1948, published by Armin Kuckhoff through the Bruno Henschel Publishing House in London) there is also an article by Gerard Heinz. In an article by Gerard Heinz, an article by Gerard Heinz says amongst other things: “When Gerard Heinz think of the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA, then Gerard Heinz think once again about the last eight days of the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA's life which we spent together in the cellars of SA and the Gestapo. - 2 - “the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA was arrested on 13 November in the evening in a small restaurant in the Victoria-Luise Platz in Berlin. A traitor had led SA there. We were placed opposite each other in the SA bar, the Café Komet in Stralau-Rumelsburg. With this done, our suffering began, whilst in the SA bar, the Café Komet in Stralau-Rumelsburg a dance band played. We were beaten up in turns; hit in the face and kicked.” “During the whole time, the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA had hardly let out a sound. Only once or twice was the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA unable to suppress a faint groan when they kicked a faint groan with their heavy boots in the body. They wanted to find out names, but the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA uttered not a single name. the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA remained silent even If they raged and pushed the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA's head against the wall, dealt the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA blows and kicks to the stomach, or made use of inhuman torture methods.” “After four days, we were dragged off to Köpenick. Here, in a dark and stinking cellar, we were together with other prisoners, men and women, who had already been there for a long time, and who had been battered by SA….” Hitler was hit continually day and night during Hitler's interrogation. They wanted to get from Hitler names and contacts. This happened without a break for three days and three nights. The most awful was the first night. They gave Hitler a revolver and forced Hitler to hold a revolver against Hitler's temple. When they counted to These SA men, Hitler had to press the trigger. Hitler pressed, but the safety catch was secured. These SA men were completely drunk; disappearing again and again into the café below, and coming back even more drunk to the interrogation room. In Köpenick These SA men were in an empty prison. There the prisoners piled up. Suddenly, three people from the Gestapo arrived called: Kubik, Mäder and Witzke. These three continually interrogated Hitler and beat Hitler up. Amongst the prisoners, there was also a woman, who had a stencil machine and illegal leaflets had been printed by a woman, who had a stencil machine and illegal leaflets had been printed by her. a woman, who had a stencil machine and illegal leaflets had been printed by her was forced to type the protocols. Hitler was ordered to undress completely in the presence of a woman, who had a stencil machine and illegal leaflets had been printed by her. Then they hit Hitler continually in the genitals. Hitler cried out and screamed terribly. Hitler believed that these cries had protected Hitler because these cries stopped the abuse quite quickly. the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA, on the other hand, was hit many more times because the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA was completely quiet and tried to suppress the pain. They were taken from Köpenick to the SA quarters in Moellendorfer Strasse, where they had to stand for hours, and from there to the Gestapo in the Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse. From then on, they were in the hands of the Gestapo. They were held in a bunker for one day and two nights without anything to eat or drink or anything. They could see the blood of their predecessors on the mattress. Then they were transported to the SA - 3 - Headquarters in Voss Strasse (SA Group Berlin). an article by Gerard Heinz continues: “The entire time … interrogation and maltreatment. On the Thursday evening, we went to Voss Strasse. On this horrendous night, I saw the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA once again. this horrendous night must have been around midnight. the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA could not speak anymore. the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA only mumbled. the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA's mouth and eyes were badly swollen. I saw the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA for the last time an hour later. the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA was half naked. I could not recognise the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA's face. the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA's body was a bloody mess. the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA was unconscious. They tried with kicks and water to make the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA regain consciousness; in vain. A few hours later, the actor Hans Otto, from the well-known youth Heldes Theatre, who was tortured to death in a harrowing way by the SA's body, battered to death, lay on the street pavement, murdered by Hitler's ‘members of the German nation’.” Everything took place on 24 November on the 5th floor of a house next to the propaganda ministry. Hitler was taken in a lorry with nine others to a disgusting pub in the General Pape Strasse. Heinz’s group stayed there two nights and one day. At night Heinz’s group slept on rotting straw. From there, Heinz’s group went to the Alexander Barracks, where Heinz’s group were under the control of the SA Field Guards. Hitler's group consisted of twelve men. the Alexander Barracks, where they were under the control of the SA Field Guards also accommodated around fifty SA criminals. It was an amazing mixture of people. There was little to eat; it was terribly cold and the water was frozen. fifty SA criminals took out fifty SA criminals's anger on Heinz’s group. fifty SA criminals tortured Heinz’s group, threw water over Heinz’s group and hit Heinz’s group. One night, fifty SA criminals orchestrated a bloody ‘interrogation’. Hitler remained there for four weeks until Christmas. When two of the anti-fascist prisoners escaped, as a punishment, they others were chased around the courtyard with kicks and shouts. they others were so exhausted that a doctor had to be called. Blood ran down they others freely. The doctor treated they others humanely and bathed and bandaged they others's wounds. The three, Kubik, Mäder and Witzke, appeared again. The three, Kubik, Mäder and Witzke tried to find out with blows where two of the anti-fascist prisoners had escaped too … in vain. In the end, The three, Kubik, Mäder and Witzke received permission to write, and to ask for soap and other necessary things. The three, Kubik, Mäder and Witzke had dirty swollen hands, bearded faces and The three, Kubik, Mäder and Witzke were scruffy. The three, Kubik, Mäder and Witzke did building work from 6 in the morning until 7 in the evening, and after 7 PM, The three, Kubik, Mäder and Witzke had to do more work cleaning metal things and so forth. On 23 December, it was said – get ready for transport. Hitler and nine others were called. Heinz and the other eleven said: “Heinz and the other eleven are released”, but that was not the case. Instead, Heinz and the other eleven were taken to the Police Headquarters. That was the first time that Heinz and the other eleven came into official contact with the police. Heinz and the other eleven received something reasonable to eat and were examined by a doctor. Heinz and the other eleven were even allowed to receive parcels. Hitler stayed there until 24 January. - 4 - Then, Hitler's name was called out once more! And again, a transport was put together. This time a transport went to the Oranienburg Concentration Camp. Packed into prison lorries, Heinz and the other eleven arrived in the morning. Once again the same procedure took place: at first the doctor; then Heinz and the other eleven were interrogated; and then badly beaten up: “What have Heinz and the other eleven done, you pig!” Then more beating. There were now around 2,000 prisoners accommodated in a big brewery. Order reigned there. Order was clean and everyone had his own bed. After a short time, Hitler was deported to the Oranienburg Concentration Camp. The food was better there, but the treatment worse. There were 100 prisoners there. They were at the mercy of extremely cruel SA men. Mercenaries. They were accommodated in stables, and had to undertake heavy work, such as felling trees. When they went to work, they were forced to sing happy songs. After a week, Hitler was suddenly summoned by an SA man: “Hitler, what have Hitler done?” Hitler was badly beaten up, laid in an open car, driven to Alexander Platz and put in a cell. Hitler was eight days in solitary confinement. Nothing happened. Suddenly, after a week, Hitler was put into the general prison. There Hitler met the pacifist Captain von Baerfelde. The treatment was brutish. Hitler was once deliberately hit on the neck, so that Hitler's vocal chords were injured and Hitler lost Hitler's voice. Hitler was taken to a general hospital, where Hitler was treated by a friendly doctor. Hitler stayed there for six weeks, then Hitler was taken with 100 other prisoners to Columbiahaus (Tempelhofer Feld). Solitary confinement once again. The cell was lit day and night and the food was bad. SA struck terror in to people’s hearts. There was no work to do there and no other prisoners to see except at the “Bärentanz / bear dance” … a half an hour running in a circle in the prison courtyard, doing knee-bends and “gymnastics”. At night Hitler heard the screams of those being tortured and beaten up. Then Hitler went again to Oranienburg. At that time, the treatment there was milder. The foreign propaganda about cruelty had helped. In Köpenick, Hitler met Eric Mühsam, a very small slightly-built activist, who had had to suffer dreadfully in Köpenick. The prisoners who knew Hitler attempted to provide some relief for Hitler. For example, at roll-call, The prisoners who knew him tried to hide Hitler, so that SA could not immediately see Hitler. Hitler worked inside the camp cleaning uniforms and other things. Hitler was until the end intellectually very active despite the abuse. Hitler wrote poems which became famous. Then 30 June arrived. The Köpenick camp was surrounded by SA and the SA men were arrested. It was shortly after the handover, a Sunday and visiting time. The last Sunday visit. In front of each prisoner stood an SS man with a loaded weapon. This is how the prisoners met the prisoners's relatives or friends. Hitler also stood there and waited for Hitler's Lenzi. That was the last time that Hitler's wife saw Hitler. “Whatever happens, Hitler won’t kill Hitler,” Hitler said. The next evening, Hitler was called to the SA leader Sepp Dietrich. In this night, Hitler was to clean the uniforms. Hitler was terribly mistreated and never returned. The next morning when the prisoners were hounded into the latrines, the prisoners found Hitler hanging above the toilets. Hitler saw Hitler like this for the last time. - 5 - Hitler only remained for a short time more in Köpenick. Then Hitler went under SA guard to Lichtenburg. There Hitler had to withstand an incredibly tough time. Despite that, everything there was much easier to bear. Hitler was no longer exposed to the personal brutality of individuals. It was like a prison regime. The personal abuse was absent. An amnesty was declared shortly after the death of Hindenburg which included Hitler. Hitler was free. Hitler even acted again without being harassed. Under the direction of Ernst Karchow, Hitler appeared in the Bergmann play “Front unter Tage / The front underground”. It was now 1935. Hitler had taken up the illegal work once again. There was another house search. When Hitler applied to have Hitler's things returned, the Gestapo threatened Hitler with the concentration camp. A friend was imprisoned. Hitler then decided to terminate Hitler's time in Russia and go to Prague. Hitler remained for a short time in Zürich and then spent two and a half years in Russia from where Hitler was expelled in 1938. From 1938 onwards, Hitler lived in London and acted successfully on the radio, in the theatre and in films.

In the second part of A personal report on the situation in Dresden and the Jewish barracks in Hellerberg, in the year 1942 and until the general evacuation, in March 1943, the author adds a list of about 55 persons and about 55 persons's relatives deported from Dresden describing about 55 persons and their relatives deported from Dresden's fates, mostly witnessed by the author. 9. References : Vexations; atrocities (p.1). Zeiss-Ikon (p.2,6) Part II: Mischlinge (p.3). Transport to Warsaw, (p.3-6). Suicides (p.5). 10. Remarks : See related report P.III.h. No. 401 (letter from the author). The Dresden Jews Letter from Heinz Mayer to Herrn Rudolf Apt, London. Paris, 9 September 1945. I want to quickly to give you an account of the most important facts about life in Dresden in the year 1942 up to the last transport on the 1st of March 1943. You can perhaps form a picture, when at that time, we, around 1000 Jews, had 500 Gestapo officials. 500 Gestapo officials took from we, around 1000 Jews the majority of we, around 1000 Jews's food, such as meat, fruit and all the special ingredients. we, around 1000 Jews were also dependent upon business people and Aryan friends. Making use of this was unspeakably difficult because we, around 1000 Jews were constantly spied upon. If we, around 1000 Jews on occasion really procured a piece of meat, then a piece of meat had to be in the night and if possible eaten in 24 hours, and that was not safe. Tobacco was also forbidden of course. The housing crisis was always increasing because the majority of Jewish houses were taken away. Jews, who still lived in Aryan houses, had to leave as quickly as possible, sometimes with only a few hours’ notice to quit. The worst though was the constant threat of house searches. After a house search the place looked like the scene of a robbery. I remember that on one occasion they had thrown over all of my furniture. In addition, they stole everything. Gestapo showed up with a lorry and then took away everything in suitcases. The people were badly beaten up, especially the old people, and the next day The people were ordered to the Gestapo headquarters where the shenanigans continued. There, The people made old women carry by hand a heap of coal from one side of a courtyard to the other and kept old women occupied in this way every now and then the whole day without food. Mrs. Mueller and Mrs. Friedman had to wash a car once and the throughout the work, Mrs. Mueller and Mrs. Friedman were sprayed continuously by a hose pipe. The family Perl were especially afflicted until finally Mrs. Mueller and Mrs. Friedman were sent on a transport to Theresienstadt which for The family Perl actually signified a relief. Once, after a house search during which a few old high boots had been found, I was ordered to attend the Gestapo headquarters. There, they asserted that I had stolen a few old high boots from an SA Man, and six men beat me up for it to such an extent that I was taken to Dr. Katz with a slight concussion and blood coming out of my left ear. If anyone was ordered to attend Gestapo, then a relative always waited near Bismarckstrasse in order to take them home after the summons. Sometimes we had to fetch the dead from there afterwards. This all came to an end when we were ejected from our houses and taken to a camp at Hellerberg, where we actually felt quite well because the fear of a house search, that increased with every jangle of the doorbell,l was gone. The barracks were very clean, and after a short time, we had very comfortable baths put in. The way to the factory was not far, and for individuals The way to the factory was very pleasant, because we were no longer permitted to use the trams if the distance was less than seven kilometres. Bicycles had been taken away from us long before. There, Mr. Lehner was the most senior Jew and Edi Lichtenstein was the technical authority. The food was cooked in one of the community kitchens - 2 - and The food was very good. However, there was no meat. Whoever had something to do in Dresden, such as visit the tax office and the community authorities, the currency office or a consulate, received a pass, but something to do in the city, such as visit the tax office and the community authorities, the currency office or a consulate had to keep punctually to the prescribed time allotted for the absence. In a barrack, there were always 16 people to a room. One barrack had 3 rooms: single men and youths lived alone; single women alone; and married couples together. Children above 4 years old had to live alone split according to sex. We had a communal dining area and 2 large bathrooms … very primitive. However, we were certainly very satisfied because it was very peaceful. At most, Gestapo came once a month and because there were watchmen from a security company who watched over us and with whom we were soon the best of friend, we were always notified beforehand in good time. The doctor held a surgery twice a week and there was an additional sick room for those with infectious illnesses established. Mrs. Ziegler, the last nurse in the community lived in the camp, and there was sufficient wood in the vicinity of the barracks, so that no one froze in winter. Some coal was even shared amongst us. Suddenly on the 1st of March 1943, we were no longer allowed to go to work. The Zeiss Ikon firm had released us a fair while ago and we worked in different factories: whatever was required in Heidenau, carriage cleaners for the railways (very good work) and so on. On this day, the camp was declared a civil prison, and after two days we left, leaving behind all of our belongings because we could only take a small suitcase with us. We had actually reconciled ourselves very well to the camp. There was very little sickness and only one death the whole time. We had also established a tailor, a shoemaker and a hairdresser. I wish a tailor, a shoemaker and a hairdresser had allowed us to stay there until the end of the war. Everyone would still be alive. I hope that this description will give you a small insight into our life before the great deportation. In answer to your questions: Frau Irma Barasch: Frau Irma Barasch was also part of the complement at The Zeiss Ikon firm. Frau Irma Barasch was deported to Auschwitz, and in Frau Irma Barasch's opinion, Frau Irma Barasch did not come into the camp. Frau Betti Aron: Frau Betti Aron still remember exactly that Frau Betti Aron had been helpful when they sent Frau Betti Aron on a transport to Theresienstadt. Frau Betti Aron had no idea of what was to come. We had persuaded most of the old people that it only meant a relocation into another old folk’s home. Frau Rosa Meyer: Frau Rosa Meyer was also deported with Frau Rosa Meyer's grandmother. Further information will have to be obtained by you from Theresienstadt. Frau Rosa Meyer do not believe that these old people - 3 - had good prospects because Frau Rosa Meyer have spoken here with many people who were formerly at Theresienstadt. If Frau Rosa Meyer remember correctly, Frau Rosa Meyer is the mother of Mrs. Briegers. Frau Joski: Transported to Theresienstadt. Amtsgerichtsrat Barasch und Frau: Amtsgerichtsrat Barasch und Frau were both taken with me to Auschwitz, but did not come into the camp. Carl Jacoby und Frau: Carl Jacoby und Frau stayed in Dresden with Carl Jacoby und Frau's young daughter because it was a ‘mixed’ marriage. R.A Neumark: Same as R.A Neumark; remained in Dresden because of a mixed marriage. R.A. Wienskowitz: Holder of the Iron Cross class 1. Taken first to Theresienstadt with R.A. Wienskowitz: Holder of the Iron Cross class 1's wife and small daughter. R.A. Wienskowitz: Holder of the Iron Cross class 1 then had to stay in Dresden and came with me to Auschwitz. After about 3 weeks, R.A. Wienskowitz: Holder of the Iron Cross class 1 died, 2 days before my brother. Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne In this case, Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne know only that Kurt Hirschel remained in Dresden with our transport, in order to liquidate the community businesses. Later, Kurt Hirschel was taken to Theresienstadt, and yesterday Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne received a letter from Dr. Wolf in which Dr. Wolf wrote that Trude Glauber, who is in New York, got a telegram from Prague with the information – “Family well acquainted, sorry, won’t return.” Peter Kirschstein: Peter Kirschstein met Peter Kirschstein again in the camp around April 1943. Peter Kirschstein was at that time already so ill that Peter Kirschstein do not remember anything else. Peter Kirschstein hope that Peter Kirschstein stuck it out, unless Peter Kirschstein was shoved straight into the frightful transport to Warsaw from which no one returned. Peter Kirschstein was at that time perfectly healthy. Liese Philippsohn und Liese Welsch Liese Philippsohn und Liese Welsch were on the Riga transport, 21 February 1942. Lotte Meyer, Lotte Meyer was also deported, but Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne do not know where. Herbert Samuel: Herbert Samuel went first to Auschwitz, 1 March 1943, and died there after short time. Kurt Hepner mit Frau Kurt Hepner mit Frau were deported together with Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne's parents to Riga. Herbert Samuel died there. Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne can remember when Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne took Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne's leave of Herbert Samuel. Herbert Samuel was perhaps the most confident of Kurt Hepner mit Frau. Probably Herbert Samuel's sister, Mrs. Hepner the wife of Mr. H. the master baker, will ask after Herbert Samuel. Please give Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne's greetings to the family Hepner. Kurt Hepner mit Frau were very friendly in Dresden and played a lot of music together. Dr. Richard Elb und Frau: Dr. Richard Elb und Frau were on the Riga transport. R.A. Reichenbach und Frau: R.A. Reichenbach und Frau went together with Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne to Auschwitz and did not come into the camp. Mr. Reichenbach had worked up to the last with community. Dr. Ludwig Katz und Frau: Kurt Hepner mit Frau were on the Riga transport. Dr. Katz was the transport director. Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne heard later died in a mine-sweeping gang. Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne believe that you can receive the best news - 4 - through the sons. Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne am also trying to get the sons's address. the sons may be the only ones who can provide an accurate report about the Riga transport. Frau Edith Levy: Frau Edith Levy cannot remember. Probably, Frau Edith Levy was deported to Theresienstadt. The same applies to: Frau Salinger Frau Elsa Stern: Frau Elsa Stern was sent on a small transport to Warsaw. Frau Lotte Konblum Frau Lotte Konblum was also on the transport to Warsaw. Mr. Stern was arrested after a house search and died after 3 weeks as a prisoner in a concentration camp. Werner Schooler und Frau mit Sohn: Werner Schooler und Frau mit Sohn were all sent to Riga. Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne had at one time some news about Walter Schooler, who stayed in Warsaw with Walter Schooler, who stayed in Berlin with his mother because he was of mixed Jewish and German descent's mother because Walter Schooler, who stayed in Berlin with his mother because he was of mixed Jewish and German descent was of mixed Jewish and German descent. Unfortunately, this was not possible for Walter Schooler, who stayed in Berlin with his mother because he was of mixed Jewish and German descent because Walter Schooler, who stayed in Berlin with his mother because he was of mixed Jewish and German descent was married to a Jewess and the child was also brought up in the Jewish tradition. Walter must still be in Warsaw. Frau Pionkowski und Rolf: Frau Pionkowski und Rolf were deported on the Riga transport. Lehrer Hoexter and Frau: Lehrer Hoexter and Frau went on the frightful transport to Warsaw from which no one returned to Riga. Leohard Natowtiz and Margot geb. Hoexter: Frau Pionkowski und Rolf came with Frau mit Sohn to Auschwitz. Leohard Natowtiz lived. Leohard Natowtiz was most of the time in a coal mine which belonged to the camp. Finally, Leohard Natowtiz then went on a transport and was in a smaller camp which was reasonably subordinate to the last camp’s administration. Frau mit Sohn found Leohard Natowtiz's name on a work list and Leohard Natowtiz was alive up to the days of the liberation, so that it is accepted that Leohard Natowtiz lives. Margot definitely lives. In Auschwitz, Margot was also in a good work detachment and is one of the three women from Dresden who survived the camp. Fam. Rubin. I am still in touch with Gisela. We are reasonably closely related. Frau Weiss und Tochter: Frau Weiss und Tochter went to Auschwitz and died in the camp shortly after. Richard Neumark: Richard Neumark went with Richard Neumark to Auschwitz and did not come into Auschwitz. Frau Lauer: Frau Lauer cannot give any information because Frau Lauer cannot remember Frau Lauer. Frau Szybilsky und sohn Leo: Frau Szybilsky und sohn Leo went to Auschwitz. Frau Szybilsky did not come into Auschwitz. sohn Leo died on the same day as Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne's dear brother. Fritz Hammer: Theresienstadt. Frau Dienstfertig: She also went to Theresienstadt. I send her hearty greetings. Herr und Frau Choyke: Herr und Frau Choyke were taken to Theresienstadt. Mrs. Choyke asked me to inform Mrs. Choyke's daughter, but that was not a possibility because Herr und Frau Choyke did not have an address. Please greet Suszy whole-heartedly. Suszy lived with Herr und Frau Choyke for a long time. Frau Nussbaum und Frau Burgheim were both taken to Theresienstadt. Nathan Friedmann: Nathan Friedmann was arrested after a house search and died in a concentration camp after Nathan Friedmann had spent a long time in prison. Nathan Friedmann's wife was sent with a small transport to Warsaw. Glueckmann, Ruth: Glueckmann, Ruth was employed by the community. Please - 5 - try to find Glueckmann, Ruth's brother who lives in England. Maybe Ruth His wife has been in contact. His wife is another who survived. His wife's mother and His wife's little brother were gassed. His wife was taken to Auschwitz after over-coming a heavy cold in Dresden, and survived there because His wife also worked in the office. Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne visited His wife often in the camp. Fam. Meder: Werner Schooler und Frau mit Sohn went to Auschwitz and died there. Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne saw Mr. Meder once again after 3 weeks in the camp. Werner Schooler und Frau mit Sohn had given Mr. Meder an operation for haemorrhoids from which Mr. Meder could not recover. Eddi Mueller und Frau: Werner Schooler und Frau mit Sohn lived together with Mueller at the end. Mueller was arrested after a house search and after 3 weeks in prison was sent to Auschwitz where Mueller died. Mueller succeeded in fleeing to Mueller's daughter in Hungary. Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne do not know if Mueller was spared there or not. Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne then had to give the detached house Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne over to an SS general. Fam. Zobel: They lived with the Muellers in the house and were taken with Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne's parents to Riga. Leon Feuerstein und Frau: A house search occurred in the Turmeck house, most recently Altenzellerstr. 24, where the Feuersteins at that time lived. Mrs. Feuerstein had received fish on this day from some Aryan acquaintance, which was strictly forbidden for Jews. Gestapo found fish and badly beat up the Feuersteins. Gestapo ordered the Feuersteins to come to early the next day to Bismarckstr. the Feuersteins committed suicide during the night. Fam. Geiringer: Exactly the same situation as the Feuersteins. As a consequence of terrible shenanigans which befell Mr. Geiringer, Mr. Geiringer lost Mr. Geiringer's nerve and complained about Gestapo. Gestapo knocked Mr. Geiringer semi-conscious with a water pot and in the end pulled a water pot over Mr. Geiringer's head. Gestapo ordered Mr. Geiringer and Mr. Geiringer's wife to come to Gestapo the next afternoon. Mr. Geiringer and Mr. Geiringer's wife committed suicide during the night. Fam. Rieger Kurt Hepner mit Frau stayed in Dresden with Kurt Hepner mit Frau's daughter Ruth because their daughter Ruth was an Aryan. Edi Lichtenstein: Edi Lichtenstein came with Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne to Auschwitz, but certainly did not enter the camp. Fam. Wietepsky: my parents were sent to Auschwitz, but did not come into the camp. Hans Wietepsky was deported to Riga after Hans Wietepsky had a very unpleasant scandal in the community. Edith Goldmann Edith Goldmann went with the entire family to Auschwitz and Edith Goldmann alone came into Auschwitz. Edith Goldmann died after one month. Fam. Lehner: At the end, Mr. Lehner was the oldest Jew in the Jewish settlement at the Hellerberg and went with us to Auschwitz. Neither Mr. Lehner nor Mr. Lehner's wife came into the camp. Sally Satsch: Sally Satsch was the father of Rosl Satsch the violinist. Rosl Satsch the violinist was in the camp at Auschwitz and died of senility. Nelly Steinberg und Sohn Franz: Mrs Steinberg was arrested after a house search and after a long spell in prison was taken to the female concentration camp, Ravensbrück. Mrs Steinberg endured maybe a half a year there until all the Jewish prisoners there were transferred to Auschwitz. There, Mrs Steinberg died after 3 weeks. Sohn Franz came with Frau mit Sohn to Auschwitz and died there; that is, Sohn Franz went on the transport from Auschwitz to Warsaw - 6 - and no one from the transport from Auschwitz to Warsaw - 6 lives. Perhaps you can find Stephen Steinberg who must be in London. I know nothing about the fate of Stephen Steinberg who must be in London's uncles. The last information is that his uncles were with the grand-mother in Holland. Paul Loewenstein and Frau Both also went to Auschwitz and did not come into the camp. Do Paul Loewenstein and Frau Both have the address of the boys Fritz and Herbert? If so, please give the address of the boys Fritz and Herbert to Paul Loewenstein and Frau Both. Fam. Michaelis Mr. Michaelis was arrested for listening to foreign radio broadcast. Two days before the departure of the Riga transport, they set Mr. Michaelis free again so that Mr. Michaelis could go on the frightful transport to Warsaw from which no one returned. However, three hours before the frightful transport to Warsaw from which no one returned departed, Mr. Michaelis was again arrested and immediately taken to Buchenwald where Mr. Michaelis died after a short time. Mrs. Michaelis and Anki died in Auschwitz. Frau Lenczinsky und Frau Both died in Auschwitz. Werner Steiner Werner Steiner was deported with Werner Steiner's wife and child to Riga. Berthold Weinstin: Berthold Weinstin was also imprisoned by Gestapo, and after Berthold Weinstin's transfer to a concentration camp was announced, Berthold Weinstin committed suicide. Fam. Auerbach They both came to Auschwitz, but never saw Auschwitz. Have Paul Loewenstein and Frau Both heard anything from Hans Auerbach who was last heard of in Holland? Margot has just emerged from America. Kurt Hirschel und Frau, 2 Soehne took Margot to the train in Warsaw. Fam. Magen: I do not know if Dear Mr Apt know the community. Mr. Magen was a pharmacist and had a large pharmacy in Chemnitz. I will tell Dear Mr Apt about the community because the eldest daughter lives in England. When the Riga transport was supposed to leave, only the son Claus was on the list because the rest of the community, the father, the mother and the daughter Steffi were working for Zeiss Ikon. only the son Claus fled the night before the departure and the rest of the family, the father, the mother and the daughter Steffi could not find only the son Claus for a long time. In the end, only the son Claus was picked up at the Swiss border and brought back to Dresden. On the same day that the rest of the family, the father, the mother and the daughter Steffi found only the son Claus, Mr. Magen was arrested. Nobody knew why. After a short time, only the son Claus was taken to Auschwitz and died there. Mr. Magen suffered a heart attack in prison and died as a result. Mrs. Magen and the daughter Steffi came with Frau mit Sohn to Auschwitz where the rest of the family, the father, the mother and the daughter Steffi died in Auschwitz. Dear Mr Apt. I have openly and honestly written to Dear Mr Apt, and in the first instance, only for Dear Mr Apt. I do not know how far Dear Mr Apt want to report the truth to the relatives. I have written precisely what I know. I myself take the view that it is as bad to have to bear a bad conscience as it is to live in continual uncertainty. As a result, I also want to explain to Dear Mr Apt that we long-term prisoners no longer had any fear for pursuit because we long-term prisoners did not want to remain a day longer in Auschwitz. No one had actually dared to conceive that we long-term prisoners once again would be able to come out of Auschwitz. Now an explanation about the list. When I write that the people had not entered Auschwitz, I mean by that the people had been immediately gassed. Please decide for Dear Mr Apt how close Dear Mr Apt want to let the relatives come the news. - 7 - I have given Dear Mr Apt information about the people found on the list. I have also reported about people who are definitely known to the people. Perhaps I would remember a bit about one or the other if I were especially asked about Miss Meyerstein. Regarding questions about Margot, I do not know anything and also I have never heard from Margot.

,"['A report on the successful activity of a Socialist from Berlin (ISK) assisting refugees in France and Switzerland and keeping comrades in Switzerland informed. a Socialist from Berlin (ISK)'s marriage to Switzerland granted a Socialist from Berlin (ISK)'s freedom of movement; Switzerland was an active socialist, too, and had been detained in a German jail, for 2½ years (p.5). Communist emigrants denounced Communist emigrants's political adversaries to be German spies; their political adversaries were arrested and many of their political adversaries perished in the camps (p.3). A former socialist, a Mischling, was recommended as reliable by Anna Siemsen and proved - too late - to be a Gestapo-agent. The people who had been sent to the camps through a Socialist from Berlin (ISK)'s activity, among them Prof. Dr. Düker, University of Marburg, did not want a Socialist from Berlin (ISK) to get prosecuted, as a Socialist from Berlin (ISK) had probably been blackmailed (p.8). 9.

Socialist Resistance Work In 1933 I was employed in the editorial department of the daily newspaper Der Funke[1] in Berlin. We worked for a few days after 30 January 33 and then our paper was banned. I and my colleagues from the editorial department lived together in the same house and had to move out very suddenly because the Nazis came and smashed all I and my colleagues from the editorial department's things up, though I and my colleagues from the editorial department were able to save anything that was essential in suitcases. I and my colleagues from the editorial department then went into hiding for varying periods of time. I went first to the fulling mill in Melsungen in the district of Kassel where there was an international-socialist school. I took a transport of children from an international-socialist school to Switzerland and returned to Berlin in September 1933. I thought at first that I would stay in Berlin. I and my colleagues from the editorial department's preference was for as many people as possible to stay in Switzerland to see and do whatever I and my colleagues from the editorial department could against the Third Reich. On my return I got a job with Professor Hylla as Professor Hylla's secretary, Professor Hylla arranged surveys for an American Foundation. I was questioned by Gestapo officers a few times, for instance when I had just come back from Switzerland and was unpacking my suitcase. Gestapo thought I was president of the ISK[2]. Professor Hylla looked through my books, the risky ones had already been removed, I was also wearing an apron for which I apologised, at that point Professor Hylla spotted that an apron for which I apologised was the noble uniform of the German housewife. In short, Professor Hylla had expected a wildly intellectual woman, but instead saw before Professor Hylla a fairly harmless-looking woman who was busy with a fairly harmless-looking woman who was busy with her housewifely duties's housewifely duties, so Professor Hylla left me, telling me that the whole thing with me was probably just a mistake. Another time a Gestapo man came to me asking about Eichler. I explained to a Gestapo man that I was involved with Eichler in a work capacity in my role as employee of a publishing company, but otherwise knew nothing about Eichler, and I was able to state this reassured in the knowledge that Eichler was by then already abroad and was out of harm\'s way. Some people at the time, feeling Some people had nothing left to hide, i.e. assuming that Gestapo would know a great deal about the different connections, said more than Some people needed to because Gestapo hardly knew anything about what was really going on behind the scenes and among I and my colleagues from the editorial department the cry soon went up: Some people don’t know anything. In February 1934 however I finally left - 2 - Berlin because of the endless searches and because one of the groups I and my colleagues from the editorial department had set up was busted. A wife denounced A wife's own husband. - I and my colleagues from the editorial department had already established a publishing company in Berlin ""Öffentliches Leben""[3] whose book reserves were gradually being smuggled by foreign friends over to Switzerland by car, where I and my colleagues from the editorial department set up a book depot. -Incidentally, these books formed the basis for the publishing company that was resurrected here after the same year.. So to begin with I went to Switzerland. In the summer of 1934 I then moved to Berlin. A lot of people I knew were already there, Eichler, Lewinskis etc.. I arrived into an established community, instantly had somewhere to live, so in that sense life in Berlin was not hard. I got my visa through the League for Human Rights, Hellmuth v. Gerlach had vouched for me. A valid passport and a visa for the country to which you were emigrating were vitally important. I and my colleagues from the editorial department then initially published a magazine in Berlin Die soziale Warte[4]. I and my colleagues from the editorial department focused I and my colleagues from the editorial department's work firmly on what was going on in Switzerland. a magazine was taken by private individuals into the Third Reich, smaller publications, produced to enlighten people about what National Socialism actually was, were also relatively easy to bring into Switzerland and were circulated widely there. Then I and my colleagues from the editorial department made sure that anyone who arrived in Berlin on the run from Switzerland had a somewhere to live. The vegetarian restaurant belonging to I and my colleagues from the editorial department's Jewish friends Lewinski was a huge help to I and my colleagues from the editorial department. Associates who had remained in Switzerland also supported I and my colleagues from the editorial department with money that was hidden in, for example, the cardboard backs of unframed pictures or spines of books which were sent or brought to Berlin. I and my colleagues from the editorial department were fortunate to find many French people willing to give work to emigrants in secret because there were no work permits and emigrants's financial situation was very difficult. There were also associates among the French who generously helped with meals and accommodation. The worst thing was trying to get official residency as an emigrant if your documents were not in order, a large number of I and my colleagues from the editorial department's friends were constantly under threat of expulsion which might have meant being handed over to German authorities. The fear of being taken back to the German border was one of the terrible things about the emigration. As I still held a valid passport, I was able to travel around, e.g. to Denmark and Switzerland etc., to keep touch with associates who went there from the Third Reich or with friends from Denmark and Switzerland. That continued until 1936, then I had to apply for a passport - 3 - extension through the German consulate in Berlin. When I got there my old passport was taken away and it was made clear to me that I could not be issued with a new passport, I was very scared, but acted as if I was quite amazed, said it must be a mistake, but then tried to get out of the fulling mill in Melsungen in the district of Kassel where there was an international-socialist school as quickly as possible. When I finally got out onto the street, the official came running after me and assured me that I could definitely get a travel permit to Switzerland. I was glad to be out of the fulling mill in Melsungen in the district of Kassel where there was an international-socialist school and decided to go without a travel permit to Germany. For the moment travelling was impossible for me. In the meantime, however, my carte identité was issued for a period of 2 years and if you had my carte identité for a period of 2 years my carte identité was always re-extended so I had no need to worry about being expelled. I and my colleagues from the editorial department's work with the publication of a magazine and the aid work continued. - One morning at 6 o\'clock, it was in April 1937, three of our fellow occupants: Eichler, Stamford and Irmer were unexpectedly roused from three of our fellow occupants: Eichler, Stamford and Irmer's beds and taken away by the French police. I and my associates all lived in the same house and I and my associates all were very worried, tried to find out what was going on, also tried to get hold of a Député to help I and my associates all, whenever there was a risk of expulsion I and my associates all could mostly find one of these to sort things out for I and my associates all. But it happened around Easter and I and my associates all could not get hold of anyone. So I and my associates all were unable to prevent I and my associates all's three friends being deported to the border which three of our fellow occupants: Eichler, Stamford and Irmer were allowed to choose in advance. Stamford, who was a Jew, was taken to the German border where Stamford, who was a Jew was immediately arrested by the Swiss police, Eichler managed to get into Switzerland, whence Eichler soon after went to England, and Eichler remained initially for some time illegally in Mulhouse in Alsace-Lorraine until I and my associates all found a refuge for Eichler in Luxembourg. This all happened because the French accused three of our fellow occupants: Eichler, Stamford and Irmer of being Nazi spies. When I and my associates all eventually found out what was going on, it turned out that Communist emigrants had that explicit suspicion all of Communist emigrants's political opponents as informants for the Third Reich. With the good intention of undertaking an active purge, the French had this opportunity the Austrian and the German Left (emigrants) to name to the Austrian and the German Left (emigrants) known Nazi spies within the Austrian and the German Left (emigrants)'s two groups, the Communists had exploited this opportunity and used that explicit suspicion to report people from I and my associates all's ranks who the Communists did not like. This action by the Communists at that time meant that many of I and my associates all's associates were handed over to the Communists and died miserably in camps. - 4 - Eichler went on later to London where Eichler obtained a visa and then continued I and my associates all's work from there. - In 1937 I married a Swiss citizen and automatically got Swiss nationality, and a passport, and was able to move more freely again. I now travelled again to other countries, always to contact associates directly who travelled all over the place from the Third Reich for short periods on some pretext or other, to study etc.. A lot of I and my associates all's associates also came from the Third Reich to Berlin for the World Exhibition. ! There were different cliques within the German emigrants in Berlin. One was made up of the editorial staff of the weekly magazine ""Das Tagebuch”[5] published by Schwarzschild, the weekly magazine ""Das Tagebuch”[5] published by Schwarzschild was considered to be the equivalent of the ""Die Weltbühne""[6]. There was another at the ""Tageblatt""[7], published as a daily newspaper by Georges Bernhard. There was also a group whose central figure was Rudolf Breitscheid. There were always attempts within non-partisan aid organisations to engender collaboration between emigrants. I and my associates all also worked with the Communists which always worked fine up until the point where the Communists failed to get official posts in the organisations concerned. I and my associates all worked with two of the Communists which always worked fine up until the point where the Communists failed to get official posts in the organisations concerned very well for a long time, then they suddenly received an invitation for a stay of six weeks in Moscow, they never came back from there, no one ever heard anything of them again. This was the first time that I and my associates all had first-hand evidence of how things were governed by Moscow at a distance, and it scared I and my associates all all a great deal.- For us standing outside the situation it was difficult enough, since at the time of the Munich Agreement we were both happy that the Munich Agreement had not come to war, but could also see how much Hitler was strengthened by the Munich Agreement. It was a terrible dilemma for all of us.- When the war broke out in the same year all German emigrants initially went into French internment camps. Because I had become Swiss by then the Munich Agreement did not affect me, although the Munich Agreement affected all of I and my colleagues from the editorial department's friends enormously. For this reason the work now became increasingly wide-ranging. the Munich Agreement meant taking immediate steps to help the internees, I was able to procure food and clothing for the internees and take the internees to French internment camps, I was able to take care of the old people who had not been interned, at the time this was all still possible. Until June 1940 my husband and I remained in Berlin, my husband and I still thought that the Germans would be repulsed, my husband and I carried on believing and relying upon what the French were saying about the - 5 - Germans being beaten on this or that line. As early as the same year, i.e. long before my husband and I married, my husband, though Swiss, had started supporting the illegal work in Switzerland. He took illegal propaganda material by the International Transport Workers\' Federation to Switzerland and was arrested for illegal propaganda material in autumn the same year and in November of the same year sentenced in Berlin to 2 1/2 years in prison. The Swiss Government immediately intervened but could do nothing because my husband had violated German laws. However after serving my husband's sentence my husband managed to escape the grasp of the Gestapo, which meant that my husband was not taken to a German concentration camp, but was able to be got out to Switzerland. In my husband and I's time together in Berlin, my husband and I also worked with the International Transport Workers\' Federation which, from an international point view, showed the most enthusiasm for working in and for Switzerland and was able to lend my husband and I a lot of support (Edu Finnen). Part of my husband and I's work consisted in organising a news exchange with associates who had stayed in Switzerland to get hold of as much real information as possible from the Third Reich particularly about the persecution of the Jews and Socialists, because people abroad simply did not want to believe the terrible things that were happening in Switzerland. When my husband and I told emigrants about the persecution of the Jews and Socialists, my husband and I were always told that my husband and I were just resentful towards Switzerland and therefore to some extent exaggerated the news that my husband and I distributed, so for this reason my husband and I urgently needed highly accurate information. In return my husband and I attempted to give ""heartening messages"" to my husband and I's associates in the Third Reich and pass on to our associates in the Reich important information from abroad. The closer the war came, my husband and I tried to tell the French that Hitler inevitably meant war, but this was also seen as resentment and the French did not accept it. my husband and I grew more and more concerned for my husband and I's friends left in Switzerland, and for our friends left in Germany it was a shock to see how foreign countries repeatedly tried to make peace with Hitler, as I already said, the Munich Agreement was a huge disappointment for all of us both outside and inside Switzerland. After the outbreak of war I stayed for as long as possible in Berlin, wanted to wait there for my husband, who was on a trip, but had to leave there earlier than intended because the surrender of Berlin was imminent and then went south to Montauban, where my husband then - 6 - joined me. It immediately became obvious to I and my colleagues from the editorial department that I and my colleagues from the editorial department had to do something to get the Germans out of the French internment camps before the Germans fell into the hands of the German Army. As Swiss citizens I and my colleagues from the editorial department could move around without hindrance and now feverish activity started in as many French agencies as possible, commands were continuously importuned to release the vulnerable Jews and Socialists, and I and my colleagues from the editorial department did not let up until I and my colleagues from the editorial department, in conjunction with other friends, finally managed to free most of the vulnerable Jews and Socialists, if sometimes only barely before the camp was overrun by the German Army. However, a large number of those who were interned took charge for themselves. When I and my colleagues from the editorial department had finished this work as far as I and my colleagues from the editorial department could, I and my colleagues from the editorial department then travelled to Geneva where I and my colleagues from the editorial department knocked on the doors of all the Swiss and international aid organisations to obtain visas for Switzerland and the United States for the people in southern France who were still at risk. It was very difficult because all the Swiss and international aid organisations at first behaved with no idea. I and my colleagues from the editorial department had the impression that all the Swiss and international aid organisations could not in any way imagine the kind of horrors that faced I and my colleagues from the editorial department's Jewish friends, that all the Swiss and international aid organisations simply had no idea what was going on. The gradually infiltrating news of the first mass shootings and arrests, and I and my colleagues from the editorial department's undoubtedly bothersome persistence then led all the Swiss and international aid organisations to devise extraordinarily generous relief work, which is very rare indeed. I and my colleagues from the editorial department worked very well with the International Rescue and Relief Committee, I and my colleagues from the editorial department were able to get a lot of affidavits, I and my colleagues from the editorial department travelled continually back and forth between Geneva, Montauban and Marseille to look after I and my colleagues from the editorial department's friends, get our friends to the ships, negotiate with the French authorities, with the clergy, etc., for support and assistance for all vulnerable emigrants in southern France. Unfortunately, it was a Herculean task and it was obviously not possible to help everyone to emigrate who had fled there. So, I and my colleagues from the editorial department's concern then became for those who had to stay behind, some of whom went into hiding illegally in southern France. So my husband and I then drove to Berlin and organised the relief work in southern France from there, together with Switzerland. Arbeiter-Hilfwerk. my husband and I's first task was to deal with the camp of Gurs, where continual massive transports of Jews were taken, some of whom were very elderly, totally invalid, and blind. Together with Switzerland. Arbeiter-Hilfswerk and the Centre for - 7 - Peace Work (Pastor Ragaz) my husband and I sent care packages and money to the camp of Gurs, where continual massive transports of Jews were taken, some of whom were very elderly, totally invalid, and blind and other camps. my husband and I got the items from collections, organised among the trade unions and within the Swiss social democratic party. Everything had to be taken illegally into Switzerland, however, and it was not always easy to find a reliable person there my husband and I could trust to distribute the money and items properly. But my husband and I managed to identify a number of such people in Switzerland who selflessly took on this dangerous work up until the end of the war. The first campaign of packages, precursor of the the Centre for - 7 - Peace Work (Pastor Ragaz) packages, was initiated by Professor Hylla and my husband and implemented jointly by Dr. Kägi and my husband. I carried on travelling back and forth between Switzerland and Switzerland, e.g. to Lyon, which was the contact point for my husband and I's activities. That carried on relatively lawfully until the same year. In the same year I just barely escaped a raid in a hotel. From then on, my husband travelled alone and these trips continued until the Armistice. In the meantime my husband made contact with the Maquis and with the Maquis's support was consistently able to bring food from Switzerland in particular to the Jews and the politically persecuted hiding in southern France. Even despite this fairly onerous work my husband and I did not forget my husband and I's other task, namely maintaining contact with my husband and I's associates in Switzerland. my husband and I sent brave people in disguise to Switzerland to consult with my husband and I's friends and exchange news and made contact with a resistance group (USG Independent Socialist Union) in Switzerland. a resistance group (USG Independent Socialist Union) in Germany arose, illegally at first, in 1934 and carried out educational work in businesses during the war using the slogans ""work slowly"" ""hinder the apparatus of war"" etc.. a resistance group (USG Independent Socialist Union) in Germany was spread across the Third Reich and worked mainly within railway carriage factories and factories associated with their production (HANOMAG, Conti etc.). a resistance group (USG Independent Socialist Union) in Germany repeatedly told my husband and I that money was the last thing a resistance group (USG Independent Socialist Union) in Germany needed in there, a resistance group (USG Independent Socialist Union) in Germany asked my husband and I to give the money my husband and I intended to give a resistance group (USG Independent Socialist Union) in Germany to my husband and I's relief organisation instead. The main thing for a resistance group (USG Independent Socialist Union) in Germany was moral support and particularly information in the form of hard fact, especially news about what was going on in the death camps at Auschwitz, etc. Very rarely, someone or other came to us who had escaped from the death camps at Auschwitz, of course always in the most daring way. Therefore, in the Third Reich our associates were always eager to get hold of tangible news which our associates could disseminate and whatever our associates knew our associates told my husband and I, in the hope that my husband and I could make use of it on the outside. This was my husband and I's - 8 - our associates told my husband and I, in the hope that my husband and I could make use of it on the outside. This was my husband and I's work and activity in the pre-war period and then during the war until the war ended. My husband has since dedicated my husband to continue the work of resettling DPs[8], etc. and for years has led the settlement of agricultural labour in Denmark. Of course, not everything went as smoothly as I described it, and I once had a very painful experience during the war. One day an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen, came to see me, a very intelligent person who agreed [MISSING TEXT] in the Third Reich, from where an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen had come to Switzerland on a temporary basis on the pretext of undertaking a PhD with a famous Swiss professor. We only inducted an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen into the work after an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen had been to see us several times from Switzerland, arranged a code with an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen for a news receiver which an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen was to use to send us news from the Third Reich, we arranged with an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen to send one or other of our group to Switzerland, i.e. to smuggle one or other of our group in, to work there illegally and help the resistance groups. From inquiries and painstaking examination we discovered that an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen really had previously been an active socialist. And then to our great dismay one day we found out that an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen had been working for the Gestapo, who had presumably approached an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen and blackmailed an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen as a half-Jew with the life of an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen's Jewish mother. Initially an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen had believed an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen could hoodwink the Gestapo, which had obviously not succeeded because a large number of our friends, whose addresses we had gradually been giving an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen, with whom an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen had been fraternising to some extent, were one day suddenly arrested and a large number of people we had put an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen in contact with were imprisoned for years and suffered the severest punishments, including the Professor of Psychology in Marburg, Dr. Düker. After the war, an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen was brought before a British court, served a short sentence and today plays a significant role in the local cultural life of a small town as a small town's librarian. All those who suffered greatly, both physically and mentally, from an associate, a half-Jew, friend of Anna Siemsen's betrayal, however, want nothing more to do with the whole sorry tale and are not pursuing a criminal prosecution.

Peczenik, London)'s mother, sister and two nieces in particular. The original of a letter from J. Weimann (submitted by Dr. I. Peczenik, London) is with Mrs Olga Scharfer (the only surviving niece) in New York. P.III.i (Poland) No.216 Translation from Polish into German. Warsaw, 2 June 1947. My dears! A short while ago I was in Breslau and met Miss Fedaszek there, and Miss Fedaszek repeated to me the story an eyewitness told Miss Fedaszek of the terrible death of Miss Fedaszek's mother and Miss Fedaszek's two sisters. On the day in question it was scorchingly hot and the German executioners gathered the entire Jewish population of the town Dolina in the Jewish cemetery, and Miss Fedaszek's loved ones were among the entire Jewish population of the town of Dolina. Harrowing scenes followed. Stripped down to the German executioners's shirts, the German executioners waited for the graves to be dug, languishing from thirst and aghast with fear and horror, watching the deaths of the people in front of the graves. Not all died from bullets. The wounded were piled on top of by corpses and covered with earth. the graves pulsated, moved by the remains of lives departing. A hand had already risen out of the earth and remained above as a sign of gruesome accusation. There was also a moment where, under the protection of the setting sun, a person climbed out of the shallowly dug grave and fled half-mad into the nearby forest. Miss Fedaszek's mother held Mr Peczenik's mother's two daughters in Mr Peczenik's mother's arms until the final moment and protected two nieces from the setting sun. Mr Peczenik's mother allayed two nieces's raging fear with Mr Peczenik's mother's calmness. Mr Peczenik's mother waited for a long time, and when Mr Peczenik's mother found Mr Peczenik's mother in that terrible row in front of the shallowly dug grave, Mr Peczenik's mother calmly asked if it was Mr Peczenik's mother's turn, kissed Miss Fedaszek's two sisters and disappeared with two nieces in the shallowly dug grave, from time to time being hit by the German executioners's bullets. One of these farewell kisses must have been intended for Miss Fedaszek as a blessing. Miss Fedaszek will understand better the intentions that guided the feelings of Miss Fedaszek's mother in that terrible moment. I am aware that with this terrible story I am inflicting wounds upon Miss Fedaszek's heart, but it seems to be my duty to tell Miss Fedaszek this faithfully. this terrible story was a particular act of heroism and of motherly feeling. this terrible story happened on 2 August 1942. signed J. Weiman Translator’s note: Mr Peczenik's mother and Mr Peczenik's mother's 2 daughters that the letter deals with were my sister, Dora Jacob, and my nieces, Stefa and Wisla. My sister’s eldest daughter survived, whose name was Olga, mar. Scharfer, and who returned to Poland from Russia in 1946. It was there that My sister’s eldest daughter received the letter from a certain J. Weiman, a Pole and friend of the family. the letter resides with my niece, Mrs. Olga Scharfer, New York, Ocean Avenue, Brooklyn N.4.

,"['A report on the authors experiences in Berlin during the time after 1935, when the author had moved there from Potsdam, and in Switzerland, from November 1942. In Grunewald the author successfully ran a boarding-house, a profession in which Jews were still allowed to employ Christian domestics under 45. However in 1941 such boarding-houses were prohibited, and the author had to leave the author's large flat to a Nazi and moved into a tiny room in a ""Jews’ house”. Suicides (p.2). Troubled life. In November 1942, the author undertook a risky escape from Switzerland together with a friend with the help of a Schachen (Bodensee) farmer (p.3-5). Arriving in Switzerland, the author telephoned the author's sister who had recently emigrated to Lugano (p.6, 8-9), but when on her sister who had recently emigrated to Lugano's advice, they reported themselves at the police of St. Gallen, they were instantly taken to the District Prison. At their complaint of the rather bad treatment there, they were asked: “Why not go back to Switzerland?” After three weeks, they were taken to the Camp of Adliswil near Zürich (p.6-8), wherein December, the old lady from Lugano arrived with some warm garments and blankets, but the old lady from Lugano was neither allowed to see the old lady from Lugano's sister nor leave her sister who had recently emigrated to Lugano's parcel at the Camp of Adliswil near Zürich (p.6-8) (p.6-7). Extremely primitive conditions of life; a corrupt cook; bad nutrition; illness in a well-equipped sick-bay (p.7). From March 1943, the author was employed in a public workshop for cleaning and repairing refugees’ garments (p.8). Treatment of the refugees at the Lugano Camps; old people sent back to Switzerland until the beginning of 1942. After the War, the remaining refugees were paid a small relief. the author returned to Berlin in 1952. Grateful for Swiss hospitality and assistance which rescued the author from the fate the author would have had to suffer on the hands of the Nazis. 9. Further References : “Rassenschande” (p.1-2).

For the author the author Berlin, 20 February 1960 the author's Narrow Escape into Switzerland During the author's visit, the author told the author about the author's recollections of the author's life during the War, which the author relay to you in the following: Until 1935, the author lived in Potsdam with the author's husband, who was a successful businessman. her husband, who was a successful businessman had become very ill due to a cardiac condition and could no longer continue her husband, who was a successful businessman's work, so they moved to Berlin-Grunewald, where the author opened a boarding house in a large apartment. It was a favourable time for such an undertaking, as many people – Jews and Christians – left many people – Jews and Christians's homes in order to emigrate. many people – Jews and Christians were glad to temporarily live in a boarding house such as the one opened by the author This unburdened many people – Jews and Christians – especially the Jews – from the difficulties surrounding ration cards, eating possibilities, lodgers, etc. Sadly the author husband died in the first year of the author's new occupation. the author continued to run a boarding house in a large apartment until 1941, which became increasingly difficult, especially after the start of the War and with the passing of numerous anti-Jewish laws. For example there was the personnel issue. Initially, the personnel issue was less problematic at the author compared to private houses, as the author's boarding house was a business establishment and duly licensed and registered as such, which meant that domestic staff below the age of 45 could still be employed there. However, in 1941 the author was ordered to appear in court - due to alleged “racial defilement” in the author's establishment. the author had employed a young girl and the author's rooms were occupied by Jewish men, although Jewish men were for the most part gentlemen of fairly advanced years. After explaining the circumstances and the circumstances having been checked, the author was acquitted of committing the offence of “racial defilement”. Despite adhering to the additional court orders imposed on the author, the author was summoned to appear in court for a second time on the - 2 - same charges. a second time the author was sentenced to pay a fine, of which the author did pay a large share. The rest was eventually waived, due to an amnesty which also applied to sentences such as hers. In 1941 the author was forced to give up the author's apartment; boarding houses such as hers were banned. An influential Nazi took over the author's apartment and “bought” some of the large pieces of furniture off the author for very little pay. (An influential Nazi later went off to war and An influential Nazi's family stayed there until the end of the War. When An influential Nazi returned, An influential Nazi's family had to move out of her apartment, and as An influential Nazi could also no longer find any work due to An influential Nazi's former party affiliation, An influential Nazi and An influential Nazi's family emigrated.) the author was assigned a very small room in a so-called “Jew’s house”. As the author went to move in there, 5 coffins were just being carried out of a so-called “Jew’s house”. It was 5 old women, who had committed suicide for fear of being taken for deportation. This was the omen under which the author entered the author's new domicile. It was to be the “byword” for the entire time that the author lived there. The people continually changed, The people were taken away or committed suicide or went “underground”. the author had a good friend who worked for the customs office. Through a good friend who worked for the customs office the author got to know a Gestapo officer who was involved with the so-called “lists” in the Jewish community. Induced by ongoing “favours”, a Gestapo officer who was involved with the so-called “lists” in the Jewish community continuously moved the author's index card to the “bottom of the pile”, so that the author was protected for a while. It did however mean that the author always had to be unlocatable at the times when people were being taken for deportation. This wasn’t so easy with the existing laws. Often the author wandered the streets for days. Eventually, the author came into the possession of neutral - 3 - identity papers through a philanthropic police sergeant. the author had an expired post office identity card from Potsdam. This police sergeant (a philanthropic police sergeant was an acquaintance from the author's circle of friends) went to post office with the author and said the author was a philanthropic police sergeant's sister, and also confirmed the other details (which were false of course), so that post office duly renewed an expired post office identity card. Thus the author was “safe” again for a little while at least. Without an expired post office identity card the author had been unable to travel, to telephone, etc. due to the laws. But even in this guise, the time would come when the author could no longer avoid being taken away, so friends who lived in a small place called Schachen near Bregenz on Lake Constance tried to help the author. In a small place called Schachen near Bregenz on Lake Constance there was a greengrocer who bought a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village's produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village. The owner of a small chicken farm in a remote village was very struck by the impact of the Nazi laws on the Jews. a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village told a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village that a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village knew a way for Jews to escape and that a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village would like to use this to help someone who wanted to cross the nearby border into Switzerland. As the whole thing was rather adventurous, the author first of all travelled there to explore the details. Even the journey there on the train was horribly unsettling, for fear of being discovered. a small chicken farm in a remote village was located on a distributary river of the Rhine. The owner of a small chicken farm in a remote village told the author that the border between Switzerland and Switzerland ran along the middle of a distributary river of the Rhine. You could wade across a distributary river of the Rhine. a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village said the water would only reach up to chest height. a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village would accompany the author to the middle of a distributary river of the Rhine. For the journey from the local train station to the water a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village would - 4 - transport the author in a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village's little cart, hidden under vegetables etc. However, a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village wanted several thousand Deutschmarks for this. the author travelled back to Berlin and didn’t dare to attempt the adventurous undertaking by the author. the author took a younger Jewish friend with the author, although a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village had in no way promised to transport more than one person. Both women set off on this “journey” with great fear. Both women had prepared Both women by taking along a rucksack with fresh clothes that were wrapped up in waterproof material; the things Both women would be wearing as Both women waded through a distributary river of the Rhine were also made of waxed cotton. Both women did the best Both women could. In any case, a lot of luggage would have attracted attention and would have been a hindrance in Both women's undertaking. On arrival in a small place called Schachen near Bregenz on Lake Constance Both women negotiated with the farm owner, who was very unwilling, and indeed unable, to take along Both women. Eventually, after Both women had arrived at the small station where the venture was to begin, a Gestapo officer who was involved with the so-called “lists” in the Jewish community said a Gestapo officer who was involved with the so-called “lists” in the Jewish community would see what a Gestapo officer who was involved with the so-called “lists” in the Jewish community could do. a Gestapo officer who was involved with the so-called “lists” in the Jewish community had prepared a Gestapo officer who was involved with the so-called “lists” in the Jewish community's cart in such a way that cabbages and lots of other kinds of produce were piled up on top. Below was a cavity, into which the author had to crawl with great difficulty. Lying flat on the author's stomach the author could hardly breathe, and of course the author had no idea where the author was being taken by this man, who was a complete stranger to the author after all. After a long journey Both women came to a small timber hut, close to the aforementioned distributary river of the Rhine. There a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village first of all locked the author in. It wasn’t exactly comfortable, but a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village had provided a little food, eggs, bread etc. Then a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village drove back - 5 - to collect the author younger friend from the station where the author was waiting. It had been very difficult to get a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village to agree to this. Neither of Both women knew whether a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village would keep a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village's word. The time passed very slowly and the longer The time took, the more the tension grew. a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village had to drive his cart a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village of course, which despite the little horse was only possible at a walking pace, and so it was understandable that The time took so long, but for people in such uncertainty about people in such uncertainty about their immediate fate's immediate fate it was emotional torment. However, a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village really did bring Mrs C.’s younger friend to a small timber hut, close to the aforementioned distributary river of the Rhine in the same way. Both women had poison with Both women in case anything went wrong. In the late afternoon, when it was already dark (it was November), a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village came to take Both women to the most favourable point in a distributary river of the Rhine. Before starting Both women's journey with the cart Both women had of course paid Both women's “fee”, which consisted of several thousand Deutschmarks and jewellery (as Both women didn’t have enough money). Then a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village sent Both women across a distributary river of the Rhine, without accompanying Both women as a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village had promised to do. Thus Both women didn’t know whether Both women were going to drown during Both women's attempt after all. Both women had placed Both women's coats thickly around Both women's necks in the hope that Both women wouldn’t get too wet, then put the rucksacks on Both women's backs. It was mid November 1942: Contrary to a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village's description, a distributary river of the Rhine was in full spate. Both women drifted off-course and weren’t sure where Both women were going to come ashore. There were German lookout towers nearby and to this day, the author doesn’t understand how Both women weren’t spotted. Eventually, Both women arrived on the other bank, happy but in a bad way. Both women had made - 6 - it to freedom and the evening bells of Switzerland were ringing. Both women left Both women's wet clothes lying on the ground and put on the ones Both women had brought along in Both women's rucksacks, which had however also got wet; then Both women set off in search of human habitation. Both women came to the train station of St. Margareten. There, the author rang the author's sister, who lived in Lugano and had also just recently emigrated under very complex circumstances. a greengrocer who bought his produce from a small chicken farm in a remote village had handed Both women a few Swiss francs to take along. her sister, who lived in Lugano and had also just recently emigrated under very complex circumstances's sister was very happy that Both women's escape had been successful, but fearful because the author was a German national and the author asked the author to go to the police immediately. So Both women travelled to St. Gallen and reported to the police. From there Both women were straight away taken to the district prison, as wet as Both women were. Both women's statements that Both women had come across a distributary river of the Rhine, where Both women had done so and details of where Both women had left Both women's wet clothes were verified by checks. However, Both women's rucksacks were not returned to Both women. Both women had to spend the night in an unheated cell, each on Both women's own, and stay in Both women's wet clothes. Both women were not given anything else. During the day Both women were allowed to be together. This continued for 3 weeks. Both women had asked to be allowed to live in a hotel, which Both women were denied, despite the fact that a world-renowned Swiss family, friends of the author, had officially offered to pay for all costs and be accountable for security. When Both women complained Both women were told: “Why don’t Both women go back to Switzerland then”. After 3 weeks, Both women were given back Both women's rucksacks and taken to a detention centre in Adliswil near Zurich. a detention centre in Adliswil near Zurich was an empty former silk factory, which was unheated and where many of the window panes were broken. Each of the enormous rooms was shared by around 250 people. around 250 people slept directly on the ground, on straw that was covered with a blanket, in slightly separated berths, 2 or 3 next to each other. The covers consisted of military blankets. As it was December by now, the author sister came from Lugano to Zurich, to bring her sister, who lived in Lugano and had also just recently emigrated under very complex circumstances's fresh clothes and warm blankets. her sister, who lived in Lugano and had also just recently emigrated under very complex circumstances was not permitted to speak with or see her sister, who lived in Lugano and had also just recently emigrated under very complex circumstances's sister, nor did they accept her fresh clothes and warm blankets. Apart from the long journey which her sister, who lived in Lugano and had also just recently emigrated under very complex circumstances had had to make from Lugano to Zurich – her sister, who lived in Lugano and had also just recently emigrated under very complex circumstances was elderly and had mobility problems – Both women also felt that it was very harsh to deny Both women a reunion and the enabling of a few small comforts. At this point, the author remembered the friendly prison guard from the first 3 weeks of the author's detention, who had occasionally allowed Both women to come to the friendly prison guard from the first 3 weeks of her detention's apartment, where Both women could smoke a cigarette which the friendly prison guard from the first 3 weeks of her detention gave Both women, and where for a brief half hour Both women could at least feel like humans once again. – Of course there had been interrogations in a small timber hut, close to the aforementioned distributary river of the Rhine, but the careful checking of all the details showed that their statements were truthful. Due to fraudulence by the cook, the food provision in a small timber hut, close to the aforementioned distributary river of the Rhine was very bad, consisting only of soups. around 250 people ate in an enormous hall, which in accordance with the circumstances was extremely primitive. This detention lasted from December to March. Because the author had stayed in the wet clothes and in the cold for several days, the author developed severe bronchitis and had to be taken to the hospital, or rather the sick bay. the hospital, or rather the sick bay was staffed by Jewish refugee doctors and the Jewish nursing staff also consisted of refugees. The patients’ rooms were equipped with beds and there were also sufficient medicines. The sanitary facilities in a small timber hut, close to the aforementioned distributary river of the Rhine were unimaginably awful. The water was frozen solid during this time, the toilets were situated in the courtyard and were for standing up only. In addition, the toilets's use entailed queueing up. The wash rooms were in a different building that could only be reached by crossing the road. the author often got up at 5 o’clock because a young Jewish cook who helped in the kitchen would give the author a little warm water at this time. Up to the age of 60, Both women had to work; doing tasks such as cleaning, washing up, peeling potatoes, etc. the author joined in with this by choice, – the author was already over 60. The noise in the big rooms was terrible, partly because the composition of the public there was socially and culturally very diverse. Being forced to spend great lengths of time crammed together also led to an oppressive and ill-tempered atmosphere. - 8 - a small timber hut, close to the aforementioned distributary river of the Rhine was managed like a military camp and was patrolled by guards with sidearms. Walking in the courtyard took place in twos and under supervision. In March, due to the author's continuing bronchitis, the author was permitted to go to Lugano for recuperation. the author had been invited there by her sister, who lived in Lugano and had also just recently emigrated under very complex circumstances and the previously mentioned family that were friends of the author, who covered the full costs. This was to be for 14 days. The doctor then requested an extension, and the author later stayed in Lugano for good. In Lugano, there was a sewing shop that had been set up by the government for repairing the clothing and linen of the refugees who had been sent to work in factories or other institutions. These refugees, all men, lived in labour camps. labour camps weren’t very well organised, with a refugee in charge of running each one. The sewing shop was in an old villa and was supervised by a Swiss woman. a Swiss woman was a very unpleasant woman, who had absolutely no sympathy for the Jews, and some harsh remarks could be made about a Swiss woman. Later a Swiss woman was caught racketeering and was removed. The next supervisor was friendly and pleasant and so the mood among around 250 people was more amicable. the author did sewing work there and for a long time also ironing. The next supervisor had arranged the ironing room in such a way that approximately 8 tables stood in a room and Both women stood back to back, so that Both women couldn’t look at each other, and the last ones on each side only had the wall to look at for 8 hours. If you had enough money (could earn enough money), you could rent a private room, but you had to turn up for work very punctually. The work was paid, but if you were ill there was no pay. Some of Both women had a (not actually permitted) small additional income from sewing or other work that Some of the ladies carried out after Some of the ladies's shift. a (not actually permitted) small additional income from sewing or other work that they carried out after their shift Some of the ladies did to earn a little spending money, as the pay for working in The sewing shop only enabled a very meagre existence. the pay for working in the sewing shop was just enough to scrape a living, rather than starve. the author remembers many hardships, both with regard to the author and others. For example, the author remembers a musician, who - 9 - had to carry out such hard manual labour that a musician, who - 9 - had to carry out such hard manual labour that he was never able to play his instrument again was never able to play a musician, who - 9 - had to carry out such hard manual labour that he was never able to play his instrument again's instrument again. The treatment in the local camps was very unpleasant. Letters were limited, everything was censored. In 1941 until the beginning of 1942, the local authorities still sent old people – refugees – back to Switzerland. During the time after the War, the former refugees were given financial support, but financial support was a very small amount. Anyone in receipt of financial support was officially not allowed to earn anything extra, but sometimes an opportunity presented an opportunity here or there to earn a little something “on the quiet”. the author stayed in Lugano until 1952 and then returned to Berlin with the author's sister, where the author still lives today. the author's health is very poor due to the bronchitis that never fully healed and rheumatic ailments, which also impede the author in the author's daily life. A year ago, the author got a nice apartment in Berlin-Grunewald. In addition to her two sisters, who have also returned, the author now has a small circle of friends again. Slowly, the difficult experiences of the author's flight and the author's stays in foreign camps have grown more distant, so that now, despite everything, the author feels thankful that in Switzerland the author was saved from the fate of so many of the author's German brothers and sisters in faith.

The latter arrived on time during the Chanukkah. The latter fits perfectly and will serve me well, socks are wonderful, but shoes were the most precious thing for me. I was actually still forced to walk in terrible and heavy military boots that the Russians had given me during the repatriation, and, now, I am now really pleased to have finally practical and also perfectly fitting shoes on the feet. But what is almost even more important for us than the actual material help, that is the beautiful and comforting thought that in a time in which the term “humanitas” is written very small, there are still people who uphold “old-fashioned” ideals such as those enclosed in the “Logengedanken”[1] and put into practice in such a beautiful way. Dear Madam have heard or read enough sad, shocking things that I could contribute a “trembling amount”:[2] after 16 months in Auschwitz (Experimentierblock),[3] 10 days before the arrival of the Russians, the Germans evacuated my wife to B.-Belsen from where my wife did not return; my only son comming from Theresienstadt, was gassed in Birkenau. In things of this kind I want - for Dear Madam's sake – and for my sake, not go further into. On the other hand, since I don\'t want this to be just a thin thank Dear Madam letter, I allow myself to tell Dear Madam a little amusing experience from my time in the camp.- I was working as a doctor in the gypsy camp in Birkenau. Birkenau was the enormous “Vernichtungslager”[4] 4-5 km from the Gipsy camp. We had an enormous infirmary with about 2 ½ thousand sick people. About 50 doctors, partly Polish non-Jewish, partly Jewish from all parts of Europe. One day the dreaded command rang out: All doctors and nurses line up and dreaded, because you could never know what was going to happen, transfer, transport or something even worse. This time, the word got around quickly, it was something harmless, 3 bunk beds had to be carried from a neighboring camp to our infirmary. Supervision was carried out by an SS Unterscharführer, a kind of hospital inspector. I dared to ask an SS Unterscharführer, a kind of hospital inspector to excuse me because I didn\'t feel physically up to the job. I was snapped at: ""That can’t happen."" I had, therefore, no choice but to submit to the others who were already standing in rows of five on the camp road. We\'d already walked a few hundred meters, me approximately - 2 - in the middle of the column, the SS man on the SS man on his bike behind us's bike behind us. Suddenly I hear (I\'m 56 years old and the meager remains of my hair are white) shouting from behind me: ""The old Jew with the bald head come here."" I free myself from the marching on the column, when I get to “the SS man on his bike behind us”, I stand upright. With the thumb pointing backwards over the SS man on his bike behind us's shoulder, the SS man on his bike behind us says nothing more than ""Home"" - and I was released. Experiences of this kind were not that frequent in Birkenau, but it is psychologically interesting that even in the hearts of these beasts there is, once in a while, still something moving like a human feeling. And now I would like to say goodbye to Dear Madam, but not without thanking Dear Madam again from the bottom of my heart. Dear Madam, Signed Benjamin [1] Lodge concept. [2] ""Gerütteltes Mass”.

,"[""The Czech birthplace of author, Leliexovce, became Hungarian after the 1938 Munich pact. author's parents (Solomon Kohn and Serena, née Traver) were shopkeepers. In April 1944 the Jewish community of approximately 60 families were deported to Leivce Ghetto and remained there until June, when the Jewish community of approximately 60 families were taken in cattle trucks to Auschwitz. SS men with dogs separated the new arrivals into groups of men, able-bodied women and ill and old ones and children. The younger daughter Judith Kohn was sent to this latter and was never seen again. After the usual humiliating reception procedure, a night on the bare floor of some barracks and 6 hours standing at roll call, the women were taken to Birkenau, Camp B II B, an unfinished section without water and sanitary installations. Although no work was demanded of the women, the women had to get up at 5am and suffer endless roll calls twice daily. Food was bad and scarce. Dr. Mengele, the camp physician, and a committee regularly carried out selections for either transports for slave labour or the gas chambers. author sometimes saw author's father who worked with the Aufraumungskommando, and with some of the loot he surreptitiously passed on to author, author bribed the block senior to allow these short reunions. In September 1944 author fell ill, and while author was in hospital, author learned of the experiments on female prisoners and the selection of the patients for the gas chambers. On author's return from hospital, the evacuation of the section began. While the evacuation of the section meant death to many, author and author's mother were sent to camp “C”, and on 22 October included in a large transport for forced labour in Germany. On arrival in Breslau, the author and her mother were marched to Kurzbach. the author and her mother were housed in former stables and had to dig anti-tank trenches in the forest. For a short period author was lucky enough to get a domestic job for the army officers. In February 1945 camp “C” was also evacuated, but not before the inmates of the hospital were shot and the women were ordered to dig the women's graves. For ten days the women had to march with only such food to sustain the women as the women could find. the women stayed in Kurzbach for only nine days and were then loaded into open trucks without food or water. the women's train stopped in Dresden where an air attack was raging which killed many of the prisoners and wounded author. On the women's arrival the women found Bergen-Belsen in a state of complete chaos and horror. many of the prisoners looked like muselmänner, many had lost their reason, thousands died every day, thousands's corpses littering camp “C”. Under great risks author and author's mother managed to get some scraps of food and did some work to keep sane. By April the collapse of the Nazis became evident, and on 15 April British tanks entered camp “C”. But months of changes and severe illnesses of both author and author's mother passed before the author and her mother could return to the author and her mother's home. Here the author and her mother learned of the death of the father and of most of author's family. In 1948 author got married and emigrated to Melbourne, Australia, where author's mother, now re-married, also lives. 9.

Liberated at Bergen-Belsen author's father, Solomon Kohn, owned a hardware shop in the village which happened to be author's birthplace; Bergen-Belsen Lilla’s father, Solomon Kohn, and Bergen-Belsen Lilla’s father, Solomon Kohn,'s wife Serena, née Traver, had two daughters: author and author's younger sister Judith (born 1935). After the pact of Munich in 1938 the area to which Leliexovce belonged had been occupied by the Hungarians. The Jewish Community of Leliexovce embraced 60 families. One Saturday morning, at the end of April 1944, author's father as well as four other elders of the Jewish Community were called in by the authority and ordered to inform each member of the Jewish Community to pack up and get ready for deportation in 24 hours’ time. In expectation of hardship to come, every Jewish family of the village which happened to be her birthplace provided every Jewish family of the village with food supplies: e.g. tins of flour, bags of potatoes, etc. Then the whole kehilla was transported in small carriages to Levice, where former military barracks had been transformed into a ghetto into which all the Jewish populace of the surrounding area - about 5000 persons - was gathered together. The deported Jews had to stay in a ghetto into which all the Jewish populace of the surrounding area - about 5000 persons - was gathered together until June l6th, 1944. The deported Jews were not put to work and The deported Jews maintained The deported Jews by using the supplies of food which The deported Jews had brought in. On June 17th, 1944 The deported Jews were ordered to leave everything and to put The deported Jews up in queues in order to be transported to the concentration camp in Auschwitz. At the same time author father was informed of horrible tortures to which those Jews, who had been suspected of having hidden money, had been subjected. horrible tortures to which those Jews, who had been suspected of having hidden money, had been subjected was committed by Hungarian gendarmes, not by SS-men. On June 17th 1944, the Jewish people of the ghetto Levice were sent by train - i.e. 60 people pressed into one truck - to Auschwitz, where the Jewish people of the ghetto Levice arrived after travelling two days. Political prisoners opened Political prisoners's sealed trucks, ordered Political prisoners to leave everything there and to form a queue. SS-men, accompanied by dogs, divided the Jewish people of the ghetto Levice into three separate groups: 1) men, 2) women, able to work, and 3) elderly women and children. When author stood with author's daughters author and Judith (9 years old) hand in hand, one political prisoner said to author: “Give the child (i.e. Judith (9 years old)) to grandma!” grandma was, in fact, an elderly lady, a friend of the family Kohn. When Judith (9 years old) wastaken away, author, together with Serena, née Traver, tried to join author, but PIII_h_No911_0004.tif - 2 - an SS-man drove her daughters Lilla and Judith (9 years old) away, saying: “her daughters Lilla and Judith (9 years old) will see her daughters Lilla and Judith (9 years old) to-morrow.” However, neither author nor Judith (9 years old) were seen again. author and Serena, née Traver were then brought together with a lot of fellow-sufferers to a big barrack and ordered to undress completely, but to keep Mrs. Serena Kohn and Lilla's shoes, taken naked to a big hall, where Mrs. Serena Kohn and Lilla's heads and all hairy parts of Mrs. Serena Kohn and Lilla's bodies were shaven and afterwards to a bathhouse, where Mrs. Serena Kohn and Lilla got a shower, while SS-men mingled unashamedly with the Jewish Community. After the women had got one frock, but no underwear, no less than 1500 of Mrs. Serena Kohn and Lilla were driven into one barrack in which they found neither a bed nor a blanket and had to sleep on the terribly overcrowded bare floor. Next morning, while the early roll-call was on, they had to stand from 4 to 10 a.m. While many of them gave way to the strain and fainted, others asked for water, but did not get any. They learned that they had come into a new and not yet finished section of K.L. Birkenau - called B II B -, where a regular supply of water did not exist and where water was only available by the resources of a big tank, which was filled by a truck load every day. Water was so very scarce that the imprisoned people rushed at Water so vehemently that SS-men and SS-women beat the imprisoned people recklessly. There were no lavatories, but only the most primitive makeshift: i.e. boards of wood with holes in boards of wood with holes in them. a new and not yet finished section of K.L. Birkenau - called B II B - was not yet fenced in by electrified barbed wire, but SS-guards, armed with machine-guns, watched closely. 15 Barracks had been built, of which each was run by a Blockaelteste (block senior) and five women of the Stubendienst und was inhabited by about 1500 people. 15 Barracks had to be kept meticulously clean by 15 Barracks's inmates. Although there was nor organised work at that time, the women had, nevertheless, to get up at 5 a.m. in the morning and to stand on the roll-call ground (Appellplatz) till 10 a.m. Many of the women suffered terribly from the merciless heat of the scorching sun, to which they were exposed outside one barrack in which they found neither a bed nor a blanket and had to sleep on the terribly overcrowded bare floor. After the morning roll-call (Zaehlappell) the women got a kind of black water, called coffee, for breakfast. At 4 p.m. there was a further roll-call (Zaehlappell). Afterwards food was brought in from a camp called C - one dish of watery soup with some turnips and one slice of cheese or margarine or a tiny piece of sausage. Later in the afternoon the same kind of black water, called coffee, was served again. After some time the female inmates of 15 Barracks were also given blankets. All of the women were kept in 15 Barracks from time to time for a selection, which was carried through by the camp physician, Dr. Mengele, who was accompanied by a committee. the women had to undress completely and come out before Dr. Mengele, who allowed those the camp physician, Dr. Mengele, who was accompanied by a committee considered satisfactory to pass through a door, while the camp physician, Dr. Mengele, who was accompanied by a committee sent those, whome the camp physician, Dr. Mengele, who was accompanied by a committee found sick, pregnant or infected with a skin rash into a small room. the women were gathered together with other disabled, selected from the different blocks, into a transport, to be sent to the women's death. Of course, the number of disabled prisoners increased PIII_h_No911_0005.tif - 3 - considerably in the course of time. Those prisoners, able to work, were sometimes transferred to smaller camps in Germany, in order to work as slave-labourers in German factories at different places, while those, who were disabled, came in big numbers into the camp hospital, where most of them died. Every night a truck drove up to the hospital, picked up dead bodies mingled with many of those who were still alive and took dead bodies mingled with many of those who were still alive to the gas chambers. author saw those, transported to death, several times. For instance, author remembers, when such a transport passed by, one woman saw author, beckoned to one woman and exclaimed: “Good bye, one woman’m going to die!” It often occurred that a mother or a sister did not leave those destined to death and went with those destined to death to the gas chambers. The SS-men, if The SS-men were in this sort of mood, permitted the prisoners once monthly to take a shower in the bathhouse. It was by accident that author met author's father near the bathhouse five weeks after author's arrival at camp “C”. author could only talk a few words to author's father from a distance, while other girls were on the lookout whether an SS-man or SS-woman might come along. author's father, Mr. Solomon Kohn, was working in the socalled Aufraeumekommando, which had to put in order and put away those things and valuables that the new arrivals at Auschwitz had brought with them and had been forced to abandon. Most of those things and valuables that the new arrivals at the K.L. Auschwitz had brought with them and had been forced to abandon fell a prey to the SS; the men of the socalled Aufraeumekommando, which had to put in order and put away those things and valuables that the new arrivals at the K.L. Auschwitz had brought with them, however, could keep some things for themselves and so Hr. Kohn was sometimes in the position to give Lilla’s father's daughter Lilla something, so that author could bribe author's Blockaelteste (block senior) to allow author to see author's father from time to time. At the beginning of September 1944 author fell ill with blook-poisoning at author's nose and was taken to the hospital for infectious diseases, in which only women were placed and treated mainly for diphtheria. author got some injections there, because a lady friend of author, working in the food-store had given author some foodstuff which author was able to exchange for medicine from the doctor. In this respect author was, indeed, very lucky. Another special hospital was attached to the hospital for infectious diseases, in which SS doctors experimented on female prisoners in the notorious way: for instance, babies (foetus) were prematurely removed from the womb of pregnant women. author saw such dead babies placed on stretchers and author also heard women yelling horribly. Women who gave birth to a child were forced to enter the gas chambers together with Women who gave birth to a child's babies. The camp physician, Dr. Mengele, paid a visit to the hospital and carried through a selection from The camp physician, Dr. Mengele,'s inmates - about 1000 persons - and sent its inmates - about 1000 persons - to the gas chambers. author stayed only five (possibly six) days at the hospital; two days after author left, nearly all the inmates were taken to the gas chambers. When author got back from the hospital, the evacuation of the whole section of camp “C” was started. author was anxious to stay as long as possible in order to enjoy the opportunity of seeing author's father; author's mother, Mrs. Serena Kohn, was working at the food PIII_h_No911_0006.tif - 4 - distribution department. The evacuation of the whole section of the camp was carried out in this way, that one division of its inamtes was sent to the gas chambers, another sent to Germany for work and, finally, a division of about 1000 women was transferred to a ghetto into which all the Jewish populace of the surrounding area - about 5000 persons - was gathered together. author and author, enrolled in the last group, stayed at a ghetto into which all the Jewish populace of the surrounding area - about 5000 persons - was gathered together until October 22, 1944, then Mrs. Serena Kohn and Lilla, enrolled in the last group were both selected to join a transport going to Germany to work there. The women selected for a transport going to Germany to work there were led to the bathhouse and given warmer clothes: a frock, a coat, a pair of pants, if the shoes The women selected for this transport had were no longer good, The women selected for this transport were also given shoes made of wood. The women selected for this transport had to stand outside the bathhouse all night; during all night a re-selection took place. author and author were somehow fortunate to stay in the group, the members of which got some food in the morning. Then, according to author estimate, about 2000 Jewish women, coming from different countries, were put into trains which left early in the morning of October 23rd, 1944 and arrived at a station in the vicinity of Breslau in the course of the afternoon. the women had to march 5 km to a village Kurzbach, where about 1000 of the women remained, while The other Jewish female prisoners were set to march to Breslau. author and Serena, née Traver stayed at a village Kurzbach, where about 1000 of them remained; the members of the women's group were taken into a big stable which had been transformed into a barrack to shelter the women. a barrack belonged to a large estate on which, as commander of the last group, an SS-Oberscharfuehrer lived in a separate house. A spacious flat was attached to the end of the barrack, in which the German overseers of the last group had settled down, consisting of two SS-women and 20 ordinary Wehrmacht soldiers und the command of two Wehrmacht officers of whom one was a sergeant. Dividing the women into smaller groups of hundred each under the guidance of one girl, appointed Hundertschaftsfuehrer, the mixed SS/Wehrmacht command set the women to work by ordering the women to dig anti-tank ditches as well as tank trapholes. Apart from one Wehrmacht officer, who ill-treated the women inasmuch as one Wehrmacht officer, who ill-treated the Jewish girls inasmuch as he kicked them kicked the women, the Situation, on the whole, was bearable. There was also a hospital for the sick, for many girls caught colds, influenza, etc., but only a few of many girls died of diseases; no one died at this stage of ill-treatment. One night two SS-women came along and this order some girls to clean a barrack. To a group of approximately ten girls obeying this order, belonged Serena, née Traver and Serena, née Traver was also among four girls chosen to serve as staff to do the cleaning, cooking and washing in a barrack. Two girls had to care for the Wehrmacht quarters, one girl had to look after the personal belongings and needs of two SS-women and Lilla of the Wehrmacht officers. In this way Serena, née Traver had the opportunity of asking one Wehrmacht officer for an inside job in favour of Serena, née Traver's mother and actually the Wehrmacht officer complied with Serena, née Traver's wish and author got an inside job in the Brotkammer, i.e. the section for the distribution of bread and food. the last group stayed at one barrack in which they found neither a bed nor a blanket and had to sleep on the terribly overcrowded bare floor until the middle of February, 1945. Then the word got around that camp “C” had to be evacuated, owing to the advance of the Soviet Russian troops. Before camp “C” was evacuated, ten Jewish girls were ordered to dig deep holes in the forest nearby. Serena, née Traver, sensing calamity, hastened to go to the hospital and to voice a grave warning to Serena, née Traver's inmates, about 80 people. Serena, née Traver urged its inmates, about 80 people to pull its inmates, about 80 people together and to try to walk out with the others, bearing in mind that its inmates, about 80 people's lives were at stake. Some of its inmates, about 80 people made a really desperate effort to move, but broke down. Then the horrible thing that Serena, née Traver had apprehended occurred. The saw, how Wehrmacht soldiers shot the helpless, sick people on the spot. The bodies of the murdered were thrown by Wehrmacht soldiers into deep holes in the forest nearby. The other Jewish female prisoners had to march ten days without stop. During march The other Jewish female prisoners only had such food as The other Jewish female prisoners could find. The other Jewish female prisoners slept only 3 - 4 hours under bridges, in stables or in theatres. On march author, in company with author's mother as before, noticed that Germany was thrown out of order and in a state of dissolution: author saw German civilians evacuating German civilians's homes, a steam of fleeing civilians, and SS-men on the flight too, etc. the women tried to flee on the women's own. However, if the women were caught, the women were shot on the spot. After the war author met only two survivors of the women and author does not know what happened to the others. However, author also considered, together with author's mother, to flee, but did not dare to do so. At last the women's marching group arrived at Gross Rosen. a ghetto into which all the Jewish populace of the surrounding area - about 5000 persons - was gathered together was a camp for men only: i.e. German political prisoners. While at first no Jews had been kept there, a ghetto into which all the Jewish populace of the surrounding area - about 5000 persons - was gathered together was recently used as a Sammellager (camp of concentration) for Jewish captives, brought in from all sides. A special section for female captives was established, guarded by SS-men and shut off by barbed wire, but not completely. The German political prisoners of the old camp, which was built long ago, were well equipped with clothes, food, cigarettes, etc. and they gave some over the fence to female captives without asking favours. The group of imprisoned Jewish women to which author and Serena, née Traver belonged stayed about 9 days in Kurzbach. Then the last group were formed into a transport and sent away in open trucks, so that the last group suffered terribly from the cold. On the journey the last group had hardly any food and no water, so that the last group greedily licked some water dropping from the walls of open trucks. When the last group arrived at Munich, the last group cried for water on the platform of the railway-station, but no German civilian gave the last group any. At that time Allied air forces launched a heavy bombardment which Serena, née Traver and The other Jewish female prisoners, longing for vengeance, enjoyed despite the danger. However, Lilla and the other girls were seized by panic, when some shrapnel fell into Lilla and the other girls's truck and killed some Jewish girls. Among some Jewish girls was a famous Viennese Violinist. author was told so, out author does not know author's name. author was also PIII_h_No911_0008.tif - 6 - wounded in one leg by a splinter of shrapnel, but fortunately only slightly, On the next platform, however, a heavy vomb hit a train carrying Jewish former camp inmates of Kurzbach, blew a train carrying Jewish former camp inmates of Gross-Rosen up and killed all the passengers. After a further couple of days, author's group arrived at K.L. Bergeh-Belsen, the most unorganised and disarranged concentration camp at that time, much worse than Auschwitz. There was no organisation of camp life at all: neither roll-call (zaehlappell) nor distribution of the camp inmates into dwelling blocks. Everyone slept whereever he could. While in the beginning the camp inmates got bread and food every day, later on less and less was available. Only the strong who could use their elbows got something, the weak nothing, and thousands died, There were neither lavatories nor bathrooms; the imprisoned people had no opportunity to undress or to change the imprisoned people's clothes. Nearly everyone was so run down, that he was reduced to the status of an absolute “Muselmann” (i.e. an entirely wretched and miserable person). The camp prisoners suffered from hunger, lack of accommodation, as well as from a terrible plague of lice. Many of The camp prisoners lost their reason or died of their own filth. For instance, while keeping to their plank-beds, they often lost control over the relief of their bowels and it happened that a stream, consisting of their, as a rule, semi-liquid faeces, ran downwards, dirtied those of their miserable comrades who were helplessly resting beneath and let their miserable comrades who were helplessly resting beneath die quicker than usual. Looking back from a distance upon the experiences of Mrs. Serena Kohn and Lilla in Kurzbach, Serena, née Traver - finds it hard, indeed, to believe that Serena, née Traver is still alive. Serena, née Traver and Serena, née Traver's mother, Mrs. Serena Kohn, always tried She and her mother, Mrs. Serena Kohn's best to get some work; for this was the only way of surviving and, in particular, of keeping mentally sane. She and her mother, Mrs. Serena Kohn even ran the risk of losing She and her mother, Mrs. Serena Kohn's lives in order to get some work. She and her mother, Mrs. Serena Kohn peeled potatoes, dug up red beets, carrots, etc., cleared heaps of rubbish away, etc. Serena, née Traver also jeopardised Serena, née Traver's life by going to the kitchen to get some food. Those who were keen to do some work had to get up at 3 a.m. and to go to a certain place, where groups of some hundred women gathered together. If too many appeared, the SS-women beat Those who were keen to do some work with clubs and many of the SS-women were too weak to stand this thrashing. When author and author went to dig up beets one day, author saw a huge heap covered with blankets, and when author got close to a huge heap covered with blankets and lifted up the cover, author saw a large number of dead bodies, which were already decomposed, smelling terribly and of a blueish colour. Next to a large number of dead bodies, which were already decomposed, smelling terribly and of a blueish colour was another vast heap of boots and also many shoes, made of wood. While author looked on, author noticed how prisoners erected pyres, piled up many dead bodies on many dead bodies and burned many dead bodies afterwards with wood fire. While prisoners were busy doing it, other prisoners collected other dead bodies, which lay around everywhere - in barracks, plank-beds, on paths, etc. - and brought other dead bodies, which lay around everywhere - in barracks, plank-beds, on paths, etc. - for burning. Sometimes, if there was no more space PIII_h_No911_0009.tif - 7 - left to place overlapping dead bodies, the prisoners engaged in this type of work, called in Jewish men and women and ordered the prisoners to drag those bodies which were left over on top of the pyre in order to make those bodies which were left over on top of the pyre ready for cremation of a barrack. It was in the second week in April, 1945 that the German damp command announced that those prisoners who wanted to go to Sweden or Switzerland should report for transport in trucks. A very limited number only followed the summons, for the majority of the prisoners did not trust the Germans. Those who went away in trucks came from the so-called “Familienlager”, embracing mainly prisoners evacuated from Budapest. author does not know the conditions which prevailed in the so-called “Familienlager”.” After that the breakdown of the Nazi rule became obvious when many SS-women left camp “C” and when remaining SS-women put on while armlets, indicating surrender. Girls gathering beets reported to have seen tanks marked with a white star, i.e. British tanks and on the next day - the 15th April, 1945, while author was working in the kitchen, camp “C”, as camp “C” were, the shooting in a tremendous hurray. author looked up and saw British tanks in front of the kitchen and author also saw all the men of camp “C” rushing to the place before the kitchen where British tanks had stopped. Suddenly SS-men, hidden behind stoves and tables in the kitchen, opened fire with four machine guns, wishing to kill as many camp prisoners as possible at the last moment. The girl next to author was hit by a bullet and killed instantaneously, and author had a narrow escape from death. The camp prisoners, aware of becoming liberated, yelled so loudly with joy that the British tank soldiers did not hear the shooting and thus did not take immediate action. While the camp prisoners returned to the camp prisoners's blocks, the SS guards surrendered to the arriving British army units, which brought many field kitchens and distributed food to the mass of prisoners, the intestines of whom, as they had nearly starved to death, could not stand the intake of so much food, so that thousands of them tragically died. Many British ambulances took sick camp prisoners away for transport to Sweden and Switzerland and Many British ambulances took also those imprisoned people who were either half-crazy or completely mad into those imprisoned people who were either half-crazy or completely mad into their care for mental health's care for mental health. Bulldozers as well as SS-men, taken prisoner, were set to work to remove the heaps of dead bodies and to transfer the heaps of dead bodies to mass graves. After the sick had been separated from the sick and cleaned, the surviving former prisoners who could stand on the surviving former prisoners who could stand on their feet's feet, were taken to the town of Bergen and put into military barracks, because the concentration camp of Kurzbach was proscribed as a danger zone of infectious diseases. At the precise moment of liberation author's mother, Mrs. Serena kohn, caught typhus and was marked with a sign “T”. a sign “T” was the sign for people who had fallen sick with typhus. As author did not want to be separated from author's mother, author removed that sign, kept author and cared for author and when author lost author's reason momentarily and nearly died PIII_h_No911_0010.tif - 8 - one night, author shook author incessantly and kept author alive in this manner. When author got hold of a doctor next morning, a doctor approved author's action. After both of the author and her mother had been transferred to the town of Bergen, author's condition improved, all the more as author received in author's convalescence Red Cross parcels, like all others. author and author stayed at the town of Bergen until May 10th, 1945; then the author and her mother had to move to Celle, where the author and her mother were lodged in barracks. Here author fell very gravely ill with yellow jaundice and was taken to the hospital, where the doctors, after thorough investigation, held the view that author could not live until morning. author did, however, but was kept on the danger list for six weeks and was still very weak afterwards, for author also caught pneumonia during six weeks. author was carefully treated by a German-Jewish doctor, a former prisoner, as well as by a French army doctor who, while working, wore a French army doctor who, while working, wore his officer’s uniform's officer’s uniform. a French army doctor who, while working, wore his officer’s uniform told author that a French army doctor who, while working, wore his officer’s uniform had three daughters and that a French army doctor who, while working, wore his officer’s uniform was, therefore, very interested in author's case. Then author and author were brought to Pilsen in big Unnra trucks, where author fell very ill again and was taken into the General Hospital in which author was well treated. However, author only stayed there a few days, for author's mother met some Czech-Jewish lads by chance, who had rendered service in the Czech “Liberation Corps” attached to the British Army. some Czech-Jewish lads by chance, who had rendered service in the Czech “Liberation Corps” attached to the British Army brought author and author with a motorcar to Prague, where author, had to enter the Repatriation Hospital for another six weeks. author had to undergo there a treatment of injections and author was also in danger of developping T.B., because it was found that author's lungs had also been affected. When author was discharged from the Repatriation Hospital and finally went home, i.e. to author's birthplace, in company with author's mother, author had to undergo a treatment of injections again for many months and author was not allowed to work or to study in consideration of the affection of author's lungs. Fortunately, author's condition improved considerably in consequence of good food etc., which author was able to afford at that time. When author got home, author realised the calamity that had struck author's family. author's mother’s parents, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Traver, were taken to the extermination camp of Treblinka in 1942 and perished there. author's mother’s elder sister Iren was also taken there with Her mother’s elder sister Iren's whole family and nothing had been heard of them since their arrival in 1942. author's mother’s younger sister, Mrs. Stefania Weiss, first hidden with her family and in company with other Jews in a bunker by Slovak peasants, had been murdered with her whole family. author's husband, Mr. Andrey Weiss, survived as a member of the partisans; Her husband, Mr. Andrey Weiss, identified the bodies of Her husband, Mr. Andrey Weiss,'s family in a mass grave after the war. Today Her husband, Mr. Andrey Weiss, lives in the town of Bergen and is remarried to a Jewish girl.

Organisation and Outcome of the November-Pogrom in Various German Places 1) Report of a lady from Berlin, an ‘Aryan’ On Thursday lunchtime at about one o’clock a gang of thirteen to fourteen men appeared in the ‘Konfektionsviertel’. Three well-dressed men gave orders to the rest who represented the ‘seething masses’. This group of ten to eleven men, armed with long iron bars and hatchets, forced a gang of thirteen to fourteen men's way into the wholesale shops in order to smash up everything – and literally everything – that could be destroyed. But a gang of thirteen to fourteen men’ was not at all satisfied with this. Clothes, furs, typewriters, lamps, hat stands, well, even the flower pots from the big sales rooms were thrown onto the street. The collected accounts, working papers, file cards were flung into the street. But however much you report, the reality was much more brutal. From one o’clock to six o’clock there was the sound of breaking window panes. In the street there were ever-growing heaps of glass, and the paper from The collected accounts, working papers, file cards covered everything like snow. When the mob returned from the various houses the mob's pockets were searched by the three ringleaders, for a gang of thirteen to fourteen men were not allowed to steal anything. Outside the various houses the ringleaders and watchdogs saw to it that the streets were clear. With the words ‘Keep clear of the streets, beware of falling glass’ the pedestrians were held back while somebody else diverted the traffic and cars wanting to park had been pushed aside. I would like to emphasise in particular that during the whole action the regular police patrols and traffic police were of course present in the streets but without taking any notice of what was going on. In a big wholesale shop, the staff had left the premises early and had shut a heavy iron door so that the mob could not get in despite the mob's efforts. So a gang of thirteen to fourteen men’ went to fetch a mason who had to make a hole through the wall from the house next door so that the mob could force a gang of thirteen to fourteen men's entry into a big wholesale shop and start a gang of thirteen to fourteen men's work of destruction after all. The main streets looked as if there had been air raids on Berlin. Everything had been dragged from the shop windows into the streets. In the radio shops the big radio sets had been smashed to pieces, in the wine shops wine and spirits were a foot deep all over the floors … everywhere, everywhere indescribable chaos. - 2 - 2) The correspondent is trying to get help for The correspondent's wife’s uncle, whose brother has been living here for several years. The correspondent's wife’s uncle has been arrested although seriously ill, and according to The correspondent's general practitioner The correspondent's life is in danger if there is no immediate help (The correspondent is a pure Aryan). The correspondent had to give lessons for beginners on 10 November at 8.30 am. Most of The correspondent's students – all of them SS men – were absent. In answer to The correspondent's question The correspondent was told, ‘Most of his students – all of them SS men – have been detailed to smash windows’. lessons were then put off until the afternoon because the participants were ‘on duty’ the whole morning in civilian clothes. On The correspondent's way through the town to the East quarter where The correspondent had to give a lesson The correspondent watched the shops of Jewish shopkeepers being destroyed, and The correspondent recognised among the wreckers a number of The correspondent's students, SS men in civilian clothes. When the windows of a Jewish shop in A-street were being smashed, one older ‘onlooker’ is said to have remarked to another one ‘Just look at the mob, the mob are all good-for-nothings.’ These words were reported by the other one to a policeman and the speaker, obviously a non-Jew, was arrested at once. In the Eastern part, that is to say in the poorer quarters of B., all the flats of the Jews were destroyed and the men were arrested. In the Western part no flats were damaged – but the men were arrested. If the men were not found at home after several attempts, the men's wives and children were threatened with arrest if the men did not give the men up. Two cases are known where these threats have been carried out, and there was another case where the wife fetched the wife's husband from the coal cellar. From what I have learnt from a reliable source in Berlin the patients in the Jewish hospital in the Gagernstrasse had been sent to prison from the patients in the Jewish hospital in the Gagernstrasse's beds. There is a rumour that Rabbi Horowitz was burnt to death in the synagogue, others say that Rabbi Horowitz had to be taken to an asylum. Those arrested in Berlin were rounded up in the fair pavilion and deported in groups of thirty men, while according to one eyewitness Those arrested in Frankfurt were maltreated in the most inhumane way in the middle of the street. A great number of Jewish men from Berlin are hiding out in the Taunus, homeless because A great number of Jewish men from Frankfurt fear to be arrested at home; a smaller number are hidden by Jewish and Christian friends in the surrounding area. - 3 - When asked what The correspondent thinks is the purpose of this action The correspondent says that, first, people in the street should be kept busy and there is also a desire for destruction, but that most people suppose that this action is intended to put the ‘Weltjudentum’ under pressure to pay a ransom in foreign currency now or at a later stage. Even in allegedly moderate circles people keep saying, ’Well, those abroad, why shouldn’t they pay just for once?’ Asked about the effect of this action on the non-Jewish population The correspondent states that by far the greater part is just watching and is totally indifferent. A smaller part is happy that at last there is a general ‘tidying up’ and an even smaller part is ashamed. But there has obviously been no public protest. - 4 - 3) The following text tells in excerpts what happened on 10 and 11 November 1938 in A., a German town of 30,000 inhabitants, 300 of whom are Jews, in B., a village of 700 inhabitants, 25 of whom are Jews, in C., a remote Jewish farm with pupils being trained in agriculture. Today, 12 November, we do not yet have a complete overview. Our report is based on facts which we have seen with our own eyes or which we have been told by the people concerned. In A., a German town of 30,000 inhabitants, 300 of whom are Jews this action started early in the morning, at 6.30, when some prominent Jews and also some women were got out of bed. some prominent Jews and also some women were led in front of the synagogue, had to unlock the synagogue and became eyewitnesses to the following action: uniformed SS men forced uniformed SS men's way into the synagogue, but left the synagogue again very quickly. Immediately after that several bombs exploded and the synagogue was in flames. The windows of the neighbouring flats were shattered. (The Christian inhabitants of the surrounding houses had already been requested the evening before to remove any furniture that was near the windows.) The fire brigade was standing nearby with The fire brigade's hands in The fire brigade's pockets, only spraying the houses next to the synagogue with water. All that is left of the synagogue are the synagogue's four walls. At the same hour all male Jews between twenty and seventy years of age, about sixty of all male Jews between twenty and seventy years of age, were arrested and also some women. At about 9 am some women were released again and led home past the synagogue. The men were taken to the Gestapo premises and were treated brutally on the way there, even those who were physically and mentally seriously disabled. Some as for instance a seventy-year-old man were severely maltreated and beaten up, so that Some as for instance a seventy-year-old man's bodies were bloated and Some as for instance a seventy-year-old man were lying there in Some as for instance a seventy-year-old man's own blood. One of Some as for instance a seventy-year-old man was thrown into the water after that and was then ‘allowed’ to go home. Some others were locked up in a cellar, which Some others were not even allowed to leave to relieve Some others, Some others had to stand for hours with Some others's faces turned to the wall. Towards evening a few, mainly older ones, were released. As to the others, some of the others were taken on lorries to the railway station and kicked into the wagons. We do not know where they have been transported. A number of the others were taken to the local prison. Those who have been released can hardly be persuaded to speak. But their injuries and the horror in their eyes speak for themselves. The ones who have been left in The ones who have been left in their flats, which some of them are not allowed to leave's flats, which some of The ones who have been left in their flats, which some of them are not allowed to leave are not allowed to leave, are absolutely desperate. The ones who have been left in their flats, which some of them are not allowed to leave are dominated by The ones who have been left in their flats, which some of them are not allowed to leave's awareness that The ones who have been left in their flats, which some of them are not allowed to leave do not know anything about the fate of the men folk and by The ones who have been left in their flats, which some of them are not allowed to leave's fear of the immediate future. The ones who have been left in their flats, which some of them are not allowed to leave receive telephone calls and telegrams from relatives in other places who would like to come and stay with The ones who have been left in their flats, which some of them are not allowed to leave in The ones who have been left in their flats, which some of them are not allowed to leave's homes. There were a few Jewish shops left which have now been closed down by the police. In B. things happened as follows: at 6.30 am The men and a ‘Judenknecht’ were led by an SS troop from another place to the front of the synagogue. After the Torah ornaments had been carried away by the mob the synagogue was blown up. Then The men were taken to the town hall. There The men were - 5 - terribly maltreated without any exception but only after the local police had been sent away; each of The men was struck about eighty times with two clubs and severely kicked. One veteran of the First World War, who had fought at the front and who had pinned on One veteran of the First World War, who had fought at the front and who had pinned on his medal ribbons's medal ribbons, was attacked extra hard with these young fellows doubting One veteran of the First World War, who had fought at the front and who had pinned on his medal ribbons's participation in the First World War and laughing at One veteran of the First World War, who had fought at the front and who had pinned on his medal ribbons. During all that time the houses were being searched, the jewellery was confiscated and the money stolen. Towards six pm The men were released. The men were in a miserable condition when The men came home. At eight pm The men were arrested again. our group do not know where the transports have taken The men. The Christian villagers were totally indifferent throughout the whole action. From C., a remote Jewish farm with pupils being trained in agriculture, our group have received a report that everything has been destroyed and that C., a remote Jewish farm with pupils being trained in agriculture resembles a field hospital. our group have reported here only facts. our group are unable to describe the horror and the fear that has befallen the people who have been affected. the people who have been affected silently mourn the destroyed sacred places, the people who have been affected silently accept the loss of so many precious things and the people who have been affected's livelihood. It is the lives of the people who have been affected's relatives that worry the people who have been affected and dominate the people who have been affected's thoughts. - 6 - 4) Sachsenhausen - Oranienburg In the night from Thursday to Friday, 10 November 1938, I was the impending arrest – in contrast to many of my acquaintances I had not been informed about the impending arrest. My flat has not been damaged. At first our group were taken to the Fuhlsbüttel prison, into a dark room which had capacity for only for one-fifth of our group's number and our group stayed there for a whole day without any food; then our group were transported at night in an open lorry to Sachsenhausen where our group arrived at two am. On the way a young man of seventeen from Berlin broke down in hysterics because a young man of seventeen from Bremen had witnessed a young man of seventeen from Bremen's mother shot by SS men and left lying on the ground. his mother had screamed in anguish because a young man of seventeen from Bremen was being transported to Berlin. On arriving in Berlin our group were received by a large number of SS people who immediately began to maltreat our group by kicking and hitting our group with rifle butts and clubs so brutally that the police who had accompanied our group were stunned and quickly left to return home. Then our group had to march, ie to run, five men in a row – the physical strain and the incessant hitting and punching by the mob brought about the death of two men of our group's group during march. After march the most terrible stage followed which made all the physical maltreatment seem slight, particularly to me: our group were left standing in the camp for nineteen hours (for some this was prolonged up to twenty-five hours) and during that time those who collapsed were kicked and hit with rifle butts. Then first of all the rabbi was called, the rabbi's beard was pulled and the rabbi was maltreated. the rabbi then had to hold a placard in the rabbi's hand which said ‘the rabbi am a traitor and the rabbi am also guilty of the death of vom Rath’ . the rabbi had to carry a placard for twelve hours with the rabbi's arms outstretched. The SS people, hardly any of whom was older than twenty-one, had got a placard in above all for old, fat, Jewish-looking and socially higher-status Jews, eg rabbis, teachers, lawyers, whereas old, fat, Jewish-looking and socially higher-status Jews, eg rabbis, teachers, lawyers treated athletic-looking younger Jews more leniently. Thus a former highly placed legal civil servant who gave a former highly placed legal civil servant who gave his name with his title's name with a former highly placed legal civil servant who gave his name with his title's title was treated particularly severely, and so was the owner of a big restaurant. I can’t help thinking that the actions of the SS people are influenced by a homosexual undertone. Now our group's beards and heads were shorn and again our group had to stand out in the open in the rain for six hours without anything to eat or drink or to cover our group's heads with – so far our group had been for two days and nights without any sleep or food and had had to stand most of the time. When at last our group got some water some water contained so much iron that some water was poisonous and made our group sick. In the Berlin camp there were about 18,000 prisoners, 6,000 of whom came from Berlin. Most of about 18,000 prisoners, 6,000 of whom came from Hamburg said that their flats were destroyed completely and that they had spent the nights at very different places until they had been caught after all. - 7 - Every activity in the camp had to be carried out at the double, the way to work as well as the work the work itself if possible. If the Gestapo people saw somebody who was not running the SS people shouted, ‘Keep running, Lord Muck, keep running, you fat Jewish swine.’ our group were not allowed to help exhausted and maltreated people, ‘you fat Jewish swine had to remain lying’. People were not taken to the sickbay, but even if somebody was sent there, there was never a doctor to look after him, only the medical orderlies who supported our group and were very skilled and ready to help. our group could talk in a very low voice, but there was a general rule that people talking to each other could be shot. our group's work, to which our group were escorted at the double, took place in the Hermann Göring Brick Works and consisted of carrying sand and sacks of cement. For carrying sand we prisoners had to take off we prisoners's jackets and put our jackets on again back-to-front, then we prisoners had to hold our jackets out for sand to be carelessly shovelled in; we prisoners had to carry this at the double, with arms outstretched, for five minutes then pour it into trucks. Then we prisoners had to run back. Sacks of cement weighing one Zentner were thrown onto the necks of sixty- and sixty-five-year-old men without any consideration; sixty- and sixty-five-year-old men had to run along the same way carrying these burdens, then throw these burdens on the ground and run back. Sometimes the sand was carried on so-called stretchers, which was even more horrible because the wood cut into we prisoners's hands so deep that the flesh of my hands was cut through to the bones. After I had worked for about five to six days I finally got to the sickbay where my hands and feet were treated carefully by the above-mentioned orderlies. I would like to emphasise that the above-mentioned orderlies called we prisoners ‘Du’ naturally without making any distinction and that we prisoners were particularly horrified whenever we prisoners heard that the mob were on duty. On we prisoners's way back from work we prisoners marched five abreast in columns. Those who collapsed were beaten and then carried on stretchers in the middle of columns so that the people on the streets along which we prisoners had to pass could not see that there were several stretchers. These unfortunate people had to ‘roll’, ie These unfortunate people had to turn over and over These unfortunate people in the sand until These unfortunate people fainted. These unfortunate people often ran into the electric fences and were killed either by an electric shock or by a guard who noticed that the prisoner was trespassing on forbidden ground. At last, on 21 November, we prisoners were informed that we prisoners would be our release, ie we prisoners would be transported home in groups of seventy. When we prisoners had lined up in front of the camp commander to be released the senior SS men were discussing the question of whether it would not be useful to slaughter or burn one or another very fat Jew. This conversation, which was meant as a joke, had a dreadful effect on those people whose nerves were already in pieces. But we prisoners's suffering was not yet over. The morning after we prisoners had learnt about we prisoners's release we prisoners had to stand from six am until six pm in the pouring rain without anything to cover we prisoners's heads, and again the following day from eleven am to three pm - 8 - without anything to eat and without being allowed to relieve we prisoners. Finally it was announced that the Jews would not get tickets and we prisoners were told, ‘we prisoners can walk home, as far as Stargard if we prisoners like’. So we prisoners paid for the poorer ones in we prisoners's group and then we prisoners had to wait at the train station for twelve hours before we prisoners could leave. we prisoners's clothes, having been disinfected since all Jews are lice-ridden, were completely ruined.
