I only witnessed the events leading up to the occupation of Holland in 1940 from the outside. My mother and stepfather were living in Germany and I went to visit them often. However, I hadn\'t had any first-hand experience of National Socialism before 1940. I lived in Amsterdam and worked as a grain merchant, having completed a business apprenticeship before moving to Holland. I then got some practical experience at a grain mill at the port in Rotterdam, where I came into contact with common, working-class folk. This was how I learnt Dutch and I picked up how to speak the language as the locals did. This was very important later on in terms of disguising myself to fit in. Later, I went on to work at the company\'s headquarters. When the Germans invaded Holland on 11 May 1940, I knew exactly what this would mean for me as a Jew. To start with, I carried on with my employment as a mid-level employee at a large trading company. I did not have Dutch citizenship. The Nazi\'s first approach was to force the Jews to deliver radios and bicycles, but I wasn\'t affected by this in the beginning. After the Germans marched into Amsterdam, a suicide epidemic erupted. Two of my friends were among those involved in this, but one was stopped before it was too late. Others tried to flee illegally. Basically, us Jews were under no illusions about the fate that awaited us. At this time, I was a member of the KP Neederlande. It was extremely difficult when, in February 1941, the so-called Dutch National Socialist Movement – presumably on the Germans\' orders – started a small-scale pogrom in Amsterdam, abusing older people and the like. Us Jews in Amsterdam had our own structure that reflected that in place amongst the population at large. So we had Jewish police officers, Jewish craftsmen, Jewish scientists and Jewish bank directors. The psychological effects of this were as follows: When the Nazis smashed up Bank Director Cohn\'s china in Frankfurt, his response may well have been: ""Oh well, as long as that\'s all that happens."" But Postman Cohn or Unemployed Cohn in Amsterdam was not quite so calm following the destruction of his child\'s bed given that items had been taken away from him that were essential to his life. The outward difference here was that the neighbour of Mr Bank Director Cohn in Frankfurt would either have been a man in a similar position to our Mr Cohn with a similar way of thinking or perhaps it would have been Postman Müller, who would have told himself that Mr Bank Director got what he deserved. The neighbour of Postman Cohn in Amsterdam, on the other hand, would have been Locksmith Jansen and he would have known only too well what it meant - 2 - to be robbed of things vital to you. His reaction would therefore have been to show solidarity. The result of all this was that a large number of Jewish craftsmen and workers stayed with their families in the days that followed the pogrom and defended their property when there was a second attempt at a riot of this kind. They fought back against the members of the Dutch National Socialist Movement, beating them out of the Jewish quarter, which had existed since the Middle Ages and where 80%[1] of the working-class Jewish population had continued to live. As they retreated, the Dutch Nazis were then attacked and beaten by non-Jewish workers. The German occupying forces, who were yet to make an appearance in this particular situation, responded by detaining and deporting Jews (predominantly young men) to Mauthausen concentration camp. Just a few short days after these young people were taken away, their families received the news that they had all died from heart problems. Only one of them, who had escaped in transit and returned to Amsterdam, was reported to have been shot while trying to escape. The population of Amsterdam was severely emotionally affected and responded with anger. A general strike was declared and the KP Neederlande thought to have instigated it. All business in Amsterdam was brought to a complete halt for around 24 hours. No trams or other public transport was running and workers walked out of their factories, salespeople left their stores and office workers abandoned their offices. I hadn\'t personally been told about the planned strike beforehand, but I joined in as soon as I heard about it by leaving work in such a way that made the others follow me. If you ask me, there were a lot of victims from this one-day strike since the Nazis didn\'t just sit back and accept it. In fact, taking this stand was a really important move as far as the resistance against the Germans was concerned because it showed the Dutch population that resistance was a viable option. Plus, the fact that people didn\'t have to be affiliated to a particular political party in order to join in with the strike meant that even people based outside of Amsterdam who weren\'t even actively involved in it then felt morally obliged to take part in some form of resistance against the German occupying forces. The repressive measures now being enforced by the Germans only encouraged this reaction. They were initially only aimed at the Jews, who were oppressed further shortly after this time. As business had come to a complete standstill, particularly within my line of work, I took a course on autogenous welding and also went to a specialist school for metal workers. This gave me a way to get closer to the working population of the city. Although I had absolutely no clue about the ins and outs, I was gradually becoming convinced that all of us Jews were going to either be murdered or end up dying in a concentration camp somewhere anyway if the war - 3 - didn\'t end with the Germans being defeated soon. As the developments at the front made it look unlikely that the war would be coming to an end in the foreseeable future, I made the decision to ""die standing"". I had joined the KP Neederlande just after the Nazis came to power in Germany. Up to this point, my involvement in the party hadn\'t extended beyond taking part in Marxist training courses and getting involved in providing aid to Jewish and non-Jewish emigrants. It was showing anti-Fascist solidarity without a party-specific message[2]. One evening, we were in a class, being taught about the Communist manifesto by a German Communist, when there was a knock at the door. One of our comrades came in and took the course instructor out of the room. The latter came back in shortly and announced: ""I\'m going to Spain."" He turned to me and said, ""You can take over with the rest of the teaching."" My immediate response was that I hadn\'t had enough training myself. He replied, ""If I can decide to go to Spain in less than 10 minutes, you can prepare yourself to teach the rest of the course in that time too."" Of course, that was long before the Second World War broke out. Shortly after the strike I mentioned before, one KP member came to me to ask if I would be willing to join in with the illegal fight against the Nazis. I agreed to be part of the fight and was tasked with putting together a group that I would first have to teach about the party\'s views on the need for a resistance movement and what form this should take. However, I was only given very little in the way of instructions from the top so that I would be able to stick to my task of bringing people up to speed on the ideology. I have to say that this ""bringing people up to speed"" was definitely influenced significantly by my own Marxist beliefs, which did not necessarily strictly follow the teachings of the party. I was very much of the belief that anything that would strengthen the resistance was good and anyone willing to respond to the call to arms was welcome regardless of their motivation. And it was by following these principles that I succeeded. I was then entrusted with designing and printing flyers. In the meantime, the situation had progressed to the point that it was suggested that the Jewish employees at my company (around 12 to 15 people) should leave (I was actually only still part of the company nominally), as there was still the option of a settlement being paid out at this stage but there was some speculation about them maybe having to let us go in a few weeks without this payment. At this point, unemployed people in Holland were forced to go to Germany as foreign labourers, so the majority of Dutch companies held on to their staff even when there wasn\'t enough work for them. This was the case at the company I worked for. We, the Jewish contingent at work, decided to accept the management team\'s offer - 4 - to take six months\' pay but leave immediately. And I want to add at this point that I, and others, received financial support from the Directors later down the line. It was around this time that the Jewish star badges were introduced in Holland and I wore one myself for a few weeks. After being mobbed and threatened by German soldiers and officers, though, I decided to resolve this issue by no longer wearing the Jewish star. 1941 was drawing to a close when I heard that the Gestapo and Green Police were starting to arrest Jews with German citizenship. A concentration camp had already been set up for these Jews in Westerbork. According to my reliable sources, there weren\'t actually any particular atrocities to report of there – at least back then – because everyone was sent on elsewhere from there. I decided that I needed to disappear and from that moment on I was living illegally. This marked the start of a new phase in my life. At the time, I knew an old woman – she was a non-Jewish German – who was doing very badly indeed. I had been paying the rent on her small apartment for a long time, having been prompted to help out by some Dutch friends. I offered to kit this woman\'s home out with my furniture and she accepted. Then, when they started to search Jews\' homes and make arrests there, I made my way to her place to hide out. Just a few days later, the German police did actually show up at my cleared-out apartment. Obviously, when I started out in my new, illegal life, I lost the option of collecting ration cards in the usual way. To start off with, I turned to the owner of a small grocery store, who I knew was a devout Protestant. Once we had pushed past some conflicting morals, he agreed to feed me from his stocks. He continued to do this for some time. I was living in a ""working-class district"" along with a Jewish minority. Young Jews in particular were arrested there at every opportunity and my landlady started to get nervous. I was worried that she might be so scared that she would betray me, so I moved to The Hague. I had some friends (a Protestant man and Jewish woman) there who offered me a place to hide. I didn\'t know my way around the city at all and one day I ended up right in the middle of a Jewish raid. Back in Amsterdam, I had managed to get hold of forged ID papers. The forgery wasn\'t exactly the most sophisticated and I was terrified that there was no way that the Dutch police officer who had caught me wouldn\'t notice. I decided to take a risk and rudely told him that I would have to lodge a complaint if he didn\'t let me go on my way immediately. I explained that I was in The Hague on official business for the Ministry of Food. I went on to say that I had absolutely no idea what he wanted with me and that they had detained me for several hours in Amsterdam too without any legitimate reason. The police officer started to bluff and apologised, explaining that I looked a bit Jewish and that the stamp on my ID papers had made him suspicious (note that this was the only genuine thing on the documentation). Then he let me go. I asked my friend in The Hague to travel to Amsterdam for me to find out how my - 5 - female Jewish friend[3] was doing. He came back with the news that she and her brother had been summoned to work in Poland and that they would be leaving the next morning. I made my way to Amsterdam without delay and went to the apartment that my friend (whose father did some minor tailoring work) lived in. When I entered the apartment, my friend was sitting at the table with her mother and two strange men. My friend jumped up and politely asked me, as though I were a stranger: ""What do you want?"" I understood what she was doing and answered: ""Your father has had one of my suits for six weeks now. I want it back as I need to wear it. I will come back at 7 o\'clock this evening and I will be taking it away with me. I don\'t care whether it is repaired or not."" And I stormed out of the apartment, swearing under my breath. I waited over the road – in the shop of the greengrocer I mentioned earlier – until the two officials had left. I then went back into the apartment, took my friend\'s hand in mine and together we left the apartment in which her parents and brothers lived. She never saw them again. Her younger brother was deported the very next day and her parents were too a few weeks later. We stayed in The Hague with the same friends as before for a while. It wasn\'t long before the KP sourced us some ration cards. These cards had been stolen from rural offices by action groups, which were not linked to any particular political party and also included a lot of students. One student group managed to get hold of better ID papers for me and my female friend. I also asked students to get similar papers for other Jews in hiding. We had to pay a price for these papers. One of the Directors at the company I used to work at gave me the money we needed without making me tell him what I was going to use it for. In Holland, this was a matter of pride and honour. A national front had been created – an individual\'s political leanings didn\'t matter anymore. It was all about doing whatever it took to save people\'s lives. After a few weeks, I thought it was advisable that my female friend and I moved in with some acquaintances of my male friend. I then left her there alone and returned to Amsterdam, where I stayed with someone I used to work with, who was now working as a minor official at a government office. He stole some sheets of paper with an official letterhead and a genuine government stamp for me. I used them to create ""official assignments"" that I could use for identification purposes. For example, I used the following kind of text addressed to myself: ""Upon your visit to company X or Y, it is essential that you check they are using this or that type of flour."" I was careful to never use any names in these letters. Now that I was back in Amsterdam, I took charge of my old group again and we started to copy and disseminate anti-Nazi propaganda materials like before. For instance, we equipped the basement of one house with typewriters and - 6 - copiers. When we arrived to start work one morning, we noticed there had been a break-in and the typewriters had been stolen. We moved our base to another location right away. However, the KP informed reliable people in the surrounding area that the machines that had been stolen were being used as a weapon against the Germans. A few nights later, they had been returned to us. I carried on with this work with the group for months and months until a few days before the Easter of 1943, when we found out that a man had been arrested with one of our flyers on him. He had been given the flyer directly by one of my workers, who was a 22-year-old, newlywed Dutchman. I broke the group up immediately and told the Dutchman to go into hiding right away. Unfortunately, he didn\'t want to leave his young wife on her own and a few days later he was arrested. About a week after that, his wife received the news that he had died from a heart condition. Given that no searches were performed at my home or at the home of any of the other members of our group around this time, we can assume that this young Dutch man\'s unbreakable silence was the cause of his death. To be on the safe side, I moved several times outside of Amsterdam. Upon my return to the city, I found that my friends were ready to continue with our work without any exceptions. I got a gun at this point and once again resolved to never be taken in by the Germans alive. The situation continued to get more and more critical. It goes without saying that the Germans were not unaware of the fact that many Jews were in hiding in Holland. They ramped up the raids. One of my Jewish friends was found in his hideout. He tried to resist and was killed there and then. It was also around this time that the friends I had stayed within The Hague were arrested. My friend\'s Jewish wife had taken her mother and brother in. These two were detained and sent to Poland, whilst the wife herself was taken to a camp, before being exonerated there and deported. Her husband also ended up in a concentration camp. He actually survived and the child is still alive now too. I then found out that there was a Dutch man living in Haarlem[4], who had a way of smuggling Jews out of the country. I believed him to be an informant and tried to ascertain whether or not my suspicions were justified by visiting him at his home. The man was very taken aback by my visit, but said he would be willing to get me to Switzerland. When I asked him for details about the transport and preparations, it became clear that he was in fact a Gestapo agent. I regret not shooting him there and then. He was later sentenced to life in prison. At least I was then able to warn my friends against him. As time went by, I had to keep moving, but the groups\' actions continued. - These actions could be divided into two categories: - 1. Those that had a direct benefit, i.e., using force - 7 - to source food for the huge number of people living illegally (Jews, people being persecuted for their political views and people who had gone into hiding so they weren\'t sent abroad as foreign labourers). - 2. At a later stage, acts of sabotage that were aimed at disrupting the tools and equipment of the German armed forces (mainly transport and communication links). Alongside these activities, we also pursued our propaganda-based work throughout the entire occupation. The aim of this was to keep the spirit of resistance alive among the people. Some of the things we did were objectively unproductive but they were still a statement of that desire to resist. Examples included an arson attack on a German cinema and robbing a Dutch office when ration cards were being given out. When I was living illegally, I bumped into a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant (Fist Lieutenant) in the Dutch Army. He didn\'t waste any time before asking me: ""Are you living illegally?"" When I answered yes, he asked where I would be eating that evening. Realising that my food situation wasn\'t all that great, he said: ""You\'re coming for dinner at mine."" I had mixed feelings about going but I was very well fed. During that evening, the officer said to me: ""I don\'t know any Jews and I don\'t want to because I don\'t like them. But I don\'t get involved with that Nazi scum because of it."" This man was an antisemite, in every sense of the word. But he had invited me over at a critical time to prove to himself that his hate of the Jews had nothing whatsoever to do with the antisemitism of the Nazis. One day, the Germans searched systematically for Jews throughout the southern district of Amsterdam. By chance, I managed to avoid this raid despite living in the area. At the time, I was in contact with a German woman who worked in the SD (Security Service) kitchen and invited me along so I could eat. The SD weren\'t aware that this woman\'s fiancé had been killed by the SA (Assault Division) several years previously for political reasons. When I went to see her one Saturday lunchtime to get something to eat, she told me that I needed to leave the city right away as a squad of thousands of police officers was expected to arrive later that day. I ran out of the house, grabbing a fishing rod that was standing in the hallway, and retreated to the countryside. I returned to Amsterdam around two days later and although I hadn\'t been caught, several hundred Jews had been arrested. What I can say is that there were two groups of trustworthy helpers standing by at all times: political and religious fanatics. As I avoided people that I knew to be Communists to protect my safety, I often had to turn to devout Christians when it came to finding somewhere to stay. A former colleague from the company I worked at before – a dedicated Catholic and father to seven children - 8 - living in a cramped apartment – said he would be willing to take me in any time. He also shared the little food he and his kids had with me on several occasions. I was really touched when once, as we were saying goodnight, the youngest in the family (who was only about four years old) promised me that he and his siblings prayed for me every night. I still had to move on a regular basis, especially once I discovered after a while that the SD were interested in finding out where I was staying and that they even knew a few of my cover names. I never did find out where they got that information from. Eventually, I ended up back in The Hague. This was around the time the Battle of Arnheim broke out in 1944. After my female friend had been working as a maid in a residential suburb just outside of The Hague for a while, I had let her leave for Arnheim, where she had been promised somewhere safe to stay. But now I considered her life to be in danger there, so I sourced a Red Cross vehicle with two uniformed drivers. These drivers would, however, require a command to travel and the only way to get one of those was with a genuine medical certificate. I went to a random doctor and asked for one of these certificates for my female friend so I could go and get her. I failed to mention anything about the nature of her illness to him, though. When the nonplussed doctor asked to see some form of identification, I simply showed him my gun. That seemed to do the trick. I sent one of the drivers off with the medical certificate to the office that needed to issue the travel command. I decided to stay with the doctor whilst the driver did this as I couldn\'t risk the terrified man being so scared that he felt the need to call this office to declare the certificate invalid. Luckily, everything worked out well and we drove straight from the doctor\'s house to Arnheim. On the way there, we didn\'t come across a single vehicle, but the roads were littered with burnt-out cars. German and English artillery shots were fired above us throughout our entire journey. We saw German troops lying in the ditches to the sides of the roads, but we managed to make it to Arnheim without any trouble at all. The house that my female friend had been living in had been abandoned. The house next door was completely destroyed. After wandering around for a while, we eventually found who we were looking for and we were able to set off together on our journey back to The Hague. On the way this time, an SS staff messenger stopped us and got into our car. Despite our protests and attempts to quote the Geneva Convention, he wouldn\'t go away. However, in the end, having him with us may have provided us with some protection against any further checks. Shortly after this, I was stopped in the street in Amsterdam by an SS officer during one operation. He pulled me into the hallway of a house and started to question me there. I was frightened to death because I had illegal materials with me in my briefcase (although they were well hidden away in amongst dirty laundry). The man wasn\'t exactly the sharpest tool in the box, luckily. - 9 - I was able to deceive him by pretending to be really stupid. I started off being very friendly and giving him information about myself and my situation, but when he asked me any further questions, I just played dumb and acted ignorant. After a lot of going back and forth, he eventually let me go. Some of the stories might sound like they are so simple now but everything we did was accompanied by an overwhelming sense of fear. In the summer of 1944, I heard that the Gestapo had searched several of my former homes and were also trying to find out information about me. At this time, the worsening food shortage also meant that all of the people that had helped me by giving me a roof over my head started to lose their nerve and I once again found myself struggling to find accommodation even for one night at a time. Based on all of these factors, I decided to make the leap over to the allied armies. The (Dutch) brother of my landlady at the time was afraid of being taken in as a foreign labourer and so he decided to join me in my plan to head to the south of the country or to Belgium until we found allied troops. I found a ladies\' bike without any tyres and took it with me on my journey. The hardest part was having to cross the three big branches of the Rhine, with some of the crossings under heavy surveillance or completely destroyed. But we managed it and we arrived in Tilburg, the city in which my companion\'s childhood home was located, sometime around 24 August 1944. The English army occupied Tilburg just two or three days later and my time living illegally came to an end. I later heard that my final fixed abode had been searched and all of my housemates had been arrested. Luckily, they had all survived.
