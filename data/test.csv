Rosten's Experiences in Buchenwald Concentration Camp.""]","['After setting fire to the synagogue and destroying Jewish property in Breslau the Gestapo rounded up the whole male Jewish population. Rosten was arrested on 11 November 1938 and sent to Buchenwald. About 3,000 people arrived there within two days. 5 storeys of shelves of bare wood served as sleeping accommodation. People were flogged at night in front of the huts and many perished. P. Rosten's Experiences in Buchenwald Concentration Camp In the following pages I shall describe, in the whole, only my personal experiences, what I have seen with my eyes or have heard with my ears. Should I mention events I have been told by other people I would make it quite clear. In the night of November 9th to 10th 1938 - the night following the mysterious death of one of the German Secretaries to the German Embassy in Paris, shot at by a young Jew - at Breslau, the town where I lived, like in all the other towns in the whole of Germany the biggest Jewish Synagogue, a large building in the middle of the town, was set on fire by the SS and all Jewish shops were destroyed. In the morning I got the news by phone from my sister and went to see with my own eyes what I couldn’t believe. It was really true: the large building, situated next to the Police H.Q. was ablaze and walking home I saw the shattered windos in Jewish shops. I met many of the Gestapo lorries, giving the special hooting signal of the Gestapo, loaded with Jews who were brought to the Police H.Q. I went home to carry on with my practice. Very soon friends of ours whose husbands had been arrested by the SS called on us telling how it happened and asking advice. The whole day long I got news that acquaintances of ours had been taken to the Police, even a boy of 16. Jews walking in the streets were arrested; it was clear that the Gestapo was rounding up the whole male Jewish population, it was a real pogrom. From 11 o’clock in the morning my phone did not work, and I was awaiting the SS during the whole day. But not before 6 o’clock next morning 3 SS-men came to fetch me and to bring me to the next Police Station. I was the first man arrested in our district on this day (November 11th). About 6 men in plain clothes were sitting in one room there with long lists, apparently checking the list of the Jews in that district, who had to be arrested. Every few minutes one or more newcomers arrived, all Jews or of Jewish origin, very many of them, of course, acquaintances of mine. None of us knew what happened to the men arrested the day before. I was rather sure that they were kept still at Police H.Q. In the middle of the morning we were brought by a lorry there, where we had to remain the whole day in a courtyard standing without any possibility of sitting down. Till the late afternoon more Jews arrived. From time to time we - 2 - had to move round in the rather small courtyard to keep warm as it was rather cold. Between 4 and 5 o’clock we got a rather thin rice soup (Please note this time!). In the evening we were moved into a larger courtyard and from there, guarded by SS-men and mounted police to a Railway Station where a special train was waiting for us. The compartments were not crowded. In every compartment were posted a Police Officer, fully armed with pistol and rifle and an armed SS-man. Besides a kick with the butt-end of a rifle, if somebody was not quick enough in boarding the train, nothing happened. I reckon that we were about 1000 to 1500 arrested people. The train left Breslau at about 10 o’clock in the night and arrived at Weimar next morning at about 8 o’clock. Long before, watching the stations where thr train stopped we had no doubt about our journay’s destination: Buchenwald.- After the train had stopped in Weimar Station Police Officers with loaded rifles were placed at both sides of the train filled with unarmed Jews, their rifles directed against the windows of the train. During the time we had to wait for the order to leave the train we had ample opportunity to get to know the mentatlity of our future guards. A youngster, belonging to the SS-Death Head Formation, came into our compartment, telling that he lived formerly at Breslau too and asking for some Jewish people he would have liked to meet in the C.C. He was not more than 20. (The whole lot guarding the Camp were about 20 or in the early 20ties but the Commander). He told the other SS-man very proudly how he enjoyed the day before beating and flogging the newcomers. He spoiled his gloves which were torn and bloodstained, so he had to get new ones! He told laughing what great fun it was when the other night SS-men took out Jews from sleeping cars and brought them in pyjamas into the Camp. (Actually, I have not seen any man in the Camp in pyjamas. Maybe they got prisoner’s wear before I arrived. But a man from Breslau Mr. T. had to go round for the whole time in slippers as the SS-men who arrested him did not give him time to put on his shoes.) One hour passed. Then we were ordered to alight and to take off our hats and glasses. In order to make you understand what happened now I have to tell you that in German railway stations the travellers going from one platform to the other or leaving the station have to walk through subways below the rails. We were ordered to hurry into such a tunnel and had to run along a row of SS-men kicking and beating with the but-ends people who, in their opinion, did not walk quick enough. I remember how they threw away the stick of an man who for some years after a serious illness had to use a walking stick. There were, of course, men who could not - 3 - walk quickly, men near the 70, sick people, and they experienced for the first time the brutality of our guards. Many men tumbled down the steps leading to the subway one pushing the other in order to avoid kicking and whipping by the SS. They used long whips with a small ball made of lead on the end. (I was lucky enough to eschew any whipping. Other people told me that though the wounds were bleeding they were not very painful). When we came into the subway the exit was closed by a cordon of guards and we were penned and pressed against the walls of the tunnel by the SS-men coming into the subway behind our backs. The guards whipped us and poured cold water into the crowd and threatened us with their guns shouting and ordering us to get closer together though we were pressed to the walls like sardines in a tin. In fear of death many men cried and moaned, everybody tried without any consideration what happened to the other people to escape the whipping and the rough treatment. I was sure that we would not leave this subway alive. Old men got breathless, some were trampled down. Never in my whole life - and I was in the 1st war for nearly 4½ years, 2½ years in the frontline with an Infantry-Regiment - I have seen such a terrible scene. Suddenly we got the order to leave the subway, of course again in a hurry and the cordon clowing up the tunnel gave way. I saw one man lying on the pavement, trampled down, unable to get up or to move himself, and he was carried away by 4 other men. I am sure he was dead or dying, the first of the many victims of the ‘action’ (that was the official term, used in the Camp). Later on we were told that the very first victim was a man who committed suicide the night before in the train. (Not the only one who did it. A former Judge from Breslau committed suicide in the first night in the Camp with a pocket knife he had hidden from the Nazis). When we left the staion running we found many lorries outside waiting. We were helped into it with the heels or butt-ends of the guardsmen. In the crowded lorry we had to sit our heads bent down. As soon as a man lifted his head up a little bit he got a whipping, and whipping was the usual way of notice when the guard whished to talk with one of us. For instance, he asked a man: ‘What is your profession?’ Answer: ‘Formerly I was a banker.’ The SS-man (laughing): ‘What? You are a rogue. - Well, what are you?’ Answer? (of course, regarding the whip): ‘A rogue!’ After a ride of about half an hour we arrived in the notorious Camp of Buchenwald, a name of horror for every Jew and all decent people in Germany. Some short general remarks: Buchenwald is situated in the middle of Thuringia on top of a hill surrounded by lovely forest covered small mountains. It is really blasphemy if - 4 - you remember that Goethe recovered rather often near this place from his duties and found fresh inspirations in this beautiful landscape. - The place is hort of water due to the structure of the soil. The whole large compound is urrounded by electrified barbed wire. The main entrace is towered by a big platform from where the whole compound can be overlooked. There always two guardsmen are standing with machine guns ready for action. Round the whole Camp small watch turrets are built so near each to the next that the sentries are able to cover the distance between them by rifle shots. They are armed with one machine gun each, besides the gun every guardsman is carrying. When our lorries had passed the main gate they stopped on a large parade ground and we had to leave the lorries in the usual hurry and with the usual help. It was about 10 o’clock a.m. and during the whole day we were moved on the parade ground. For the whole time Jews from all parts of Germany arrived. (The Hews from Berlin were brought to the C.C. at Sachsenhausen near Berlin, the Jews from South Germany to Dachau near Munich). At Buchenwald during these 2 days about 10.000 people arrived, about 3.000 between them from Breslau, and about the same number from Frankfurt-on-Main. It was a dark night when at midnight we physically and mentally exhausted, not to say broken, were allowed to enter a large hut. We had not got any food nor drink since the afternoon the day before. We passed the rest of the night in the not yet finished hut sitting on large logs and boards leaning one to the other. Early next morning we had to leave the hut. We were allowed to loiter for a short time in front of the hut before we were ordered again to the parade ground. But not before 11 o’clock we got some so-called coffee: we were standing in rank and file, and one small bowl had to do for 10 people. The last man, of course, could be happy if he got more than a few drops! Never in my life any coffee tasted so nicely to me, though it was no real coffee! - One experience we had this morning: a man broke down on the parade ground and was laid down under a tree. He was moaning and apparently suffering very much. Nobody was allowed to talk to him nor to give him any help, not even a drop of water. He was lying there till he was dead. Now I shall have to explain to you the arrangements in the huts, our accomodation for the next weeks. The prisoners who had to live for a longer time (some for many years), in the C.C. were accomodated in small huts, got prisoner’s wear, had to work hard; they could wash every second day. We 10.000 taken into the C.C. during this ‘November action’ were accomodated into 5 large wooden sheds, quickly and roughly built. The arrangements in these - 5 - huts I cannot compare but with the bookshelves in a library. On the walls and between there were erected large wooden frames with 5 storeys of shelves. On these bare boards we had to lie and to try to sleep. But books stand in the shelves of a library; here nobody but the men on the top of the storeys could really sit down, as the other ‘frames’ were not high enough. The men sleeping in the upper storeys had to climb up like monkeys. I used to take off my jacket and used it as a pillow wrapping myself in my overcoat. I could not take off my shoes for the night, as one of my laces was torn and I had to knot it. The nights were terrible. I slept mostly for about 2 hours. Most people had caught a cold, so they were coughing and sneezing the whole night. Many had to get up in the night. It was almost impossible to sleep. In the first nights which I shall describe later many men started crying, driven nearly or really mad. There were some men about 70, on the other hand boys under 18, crippled men, sick men, the worst very likely, a barrister from Hannover, wounded in the last war, with many scars in his face, one eye lost, incapable to walk without other people’s help. One of the worst features was the thirst. We had no possibility to get water. Later on we could buy sometimes mineral water, though rather expensive. When we got this water for the first time nearly fighting was going on because many men were afraid they would not get a bottle. One rainy day we were standing under the caves with mugs to collect some rainwater for a drink. I had caught a very bad cold in consequence of which I was nearly deaf on one ear for about 2 months. I went to the doctor to get a tabloid but it was more important to get the few drops of water he could give with the tabloid. Some doctors between us had started a volontary medical service in the huts, an emergency service only, of course. Who fell seriously ill, was mostly lost. The sick people were brought into a special room and some serious cases into the Camp Hospital. Day after day many of the prisoners died. They were cremated and not before some weeks later the relatives got the ashes. Never before in my life I have seen the connection between body and sould as clearly as there: a man got a nervous breakdown and collapsed afterwards, and many of them could not recover. It have no estimate about the death rate, but I was told by an older prisoner that on a single day up to 30 men died. The sanitary conveniences were much worse than I have ever seen in the last war. It was really a miracle that no epidemic disease broke out. I cannot give a description but I have to mention that the whole plant consisted from pits and long poles in the open air and that there was room for about 75 at a time (and we were 10.000). - 6 - As indigestion was a common feature the men were queuing the whole dau for the use of this convenience. During the night we were not allowed to got there but in groups of 10 men and one of them had to ask leave of one of the guards standing on the nearest turret. For fun they made conditions, for instance, they ordered the men to lie down at first, in a rainy night, of course; in another night a man had to sing a song before getting the permission. When a man left the hut alone not aware that he had to wait for the others the sentry shot. - Washing accomodation did not exist. I could not wash even my hands or rinse my mouth for the whole 3 weeks. Food was not bad, but on Sundays we did not get a midday meal. For supper we got bread rather plentiful. But we had no opportunity to keep our supplies in a proper way. We had to kepp it in our shelves where we slept or in the pockets of our coats. For supper we got sometimes sausage or smoked herring or meat jelly, but we had to eat it with the fingers as we got, in the first week, neither plates nor cutlery. And we knew that our comrades who distributed the food hat not washed their hands as long as we. For the midday meal, a hot dish, about 200 plates or bowls and sppons were available for 2000 men in one hut. Therefore everybody who was not so fortunate to be between the first 200 had to use a dirty plate and spoon, as there was no earthly chance to clean it. Later on we could buy, of course very expensive, plates and sppons and mugs for our own. But there was still no chance for cleaning your things. I used to try to clean my plate with the paper sheets from a copy book I could get. During our meals we had no opportunity to sit down. We had to stand in fron of the hut or to eat walking to and fro outdoors or, in the evening, lying on the shelves. - Before we were released we had to leave our bought plates etc. and to pay 5/- each for using the Government’s property! In the huts and outside the huts big loudspeakers were installed and all order were given from H.Q. by loudspeaker. When we were addressed the usual language was: Jewish swines listen, or Jewish gang for release or for other reasons, they said always: The Jew X. Anything was done to strain on our nerves and to produce a nervous breakdown. And now I shall have to try to describe to you the terrible horroe happening during the first 4 or 5 nights. Between our huts - our 5 huts - were rather small passages. In the middle of the night a detachment of the guardsmen brought a sort of frame, which I have seen in daylight on the second day, to lay down men for flogging and then they flogged and whipped - 7 - several men with 25 strokes of a whip or ‘Cat’ I don’t know why they tortured these men, maybe they had committed some ‘crime’, perhaps given an answer not having been asked for. But i know that they took indiscreminately especially young men from the huts and especially those who started crying. How many were killed in these nights I cannot tell. We were not allowed to leave our shelves. But I heard more than once the order: ‘Take away the corpse’ and one morning I saw a man dead in front of our hut. To describe what was going on inside the hut during th such a night is impossible. Old and young men in fear of getting flogged cried and moaned, some were praying, many soiled themselves, as they were not allowed to leave the hut. Small wonder that some perhaps driven mad or in a vain attempt to escape ran against the electrified barbed wire and died at once. - I have to mention that the older prisoners who had to assist our guards, some old Communists who had been for 5 years and longer in the CC tried their best to help us, especially during these terrible scenes. They smacked us every now and then but only when one of the supervisors was present. It was not wise to stand in the first or last file as the SS-men liked to kick and smack us as often as possible. Flogging I have seen in daytime too, one man got 25 strokes because he was walking, by mistake, round instead of sitting in rank and file on the parade ground. It was obvious that the flogging was great fun for the men doing this job, a special commando. - After the first 5 days were gone the SS-men left us, in the whole, to ourselves and we were guarded by older prisoners, some well educated by the SS-men. Other tortures I have not seen with my own eyes. But next to the entrance gate we heard often moaning and crying and we were told by the older prisoners that the moaning men were hanged up with their arms on the ceiling for 24 hours. I was asked often: how did you get out? - About one week after our imprisonment the first men were released, all men who could prove that the had an opportunity for emigration in the very near future. After a fortnight all men over 60 were released an by the end of the 3rd week all those who could produce the certificate that they were in the possession of the Remembrance Medal for combattants in the last war. Only who had by pure chance this certificate in his pocket! Other papers who proved that they were combatants of the last war were not accepted. I was lucky enough to have this certificate with me. - And now to end my story some items from our release, with a somewhat comical tinge. Before our release we got a shave and had, of course, to pay for it. We were warned by more experienced people to hide some of our money, and - 8 - so I kept in my hand ½ Mk, about lod to pay for it, but the SS-man serving as cashier took out of my pocket 5 Mk, about 8/, that was the most expensive shave I ever got. Before we left the Camp the had the impudence to collect money from us for the ‘Winterhilfswerk des Deutschen Volkes’ (Winter Relief Funds for the German People) and I am still glad that I managed to give not more than 10 Pf. (2d) to these brutes. I am sure that they kept the money for themselves. Guards brought us to the main road leading to Weimar, leading us through shrubs on a small slippery pathway through the forest, in a hurry of course. From Weimar we were not allowed to travel by fast train. Next morning I arrived at home - but I had to report at once to the Gestapo H.Q. and to sign a form that I acknowledged to have been released from the C.C. only to be able to speedy up my and my family’s emigration. But it lasted 8 long and dreadful months before we reached this helpful country and could spleep for the first time without fear to experience once more a German concentration camp. - That is the story I have to tell you. We are in the middle of the fight against these dark and evil powers, or perhaps starting the last chapter. We are told and we read so often that after this war is over anything will be better than it was before. So the story might be true that one soldier told his pal: Well, if the world will be such a lovely place after the war why didn’t we start this war earlier?’ It is up to the younger generation to build up a better world from the shambles our generation left them. And when, one day, the last Nazi died in a C.C. there should be no room for Concentration Camps any more in a world free from fear.']"
